Abstract    :
              This award provides support for the Seventh U.S. National Conference on
              Earthquake Engineering, 7NCEE by partially underwriting the administrative and
              development costs, and to make possible increased participation in the
              conference of graduate students in earthquake engineering disciplines.

The
              Conference is the seventh in a series of national conferences on earthquake
              engineering. Previous conferences have been held in Ann Arbor, Michigan;
              Stanford, California; Charleston, South Carolina; Palm Springs, California;
              Chicago, Illinois, and Seattle, Washington. They are held every four years,
              midway in time between the dates of the quadrennial World Conferences on
              Earthquake Engineering. Each of the national conferences has been sponsored by
              EERI, the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, a non-profit professional
              society devoted to earthquake engineering and earthquake loss reduction.

The
              7NCEE will be held in Boston, Massachusetts and will provide an opportunity for
              researchers and professional practitioners, in all the disciplines in the
              earthquake field, to come together and exchange research results, design
              practices, and organizational and policy perspectives that influence the
              effectiveness of earthquake preparedness, mitigation, and recovery. The
              Proceedings provide a valuable repository of information, critical to the
              future advancement of earthquake engineering.
