Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for travel expenses for participants in a
              symposium entitled "Polymer Diffraction Methods" to be held at the national
              meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS) in Orlando, FL, during the week
              of April 7-1, 2002.  The symposium is sponsored by the Polymer Division of ACS,
              and is chaired by John Blackwell (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland,
              OH) and Kenn H. Gardner (DuPont Central Research, Wilmington, DE.).  It seeks
              to explore the latest research advances and to review the state of the art in
              structure analysis for polymers at the molecular level.  There will be three
              full days for oral presentations by 36 invited speakers, plus a poster session
              with 7 contributions.  The symposium will be truly international, with speakers
              from France (7), UK (6), Japan (2), Spain (2), Germany (1), Canada (1), Italy
              (1), Korea (1) and Russia (1), as well as from the USA 914).  In addition to
              inviting the leading researchers in the field the organizers have also made
              deliberate efforts to include presentations by younger scientists: new faculty
              still establishing their careers (3) and highly promising postdoctoral research
              associates (7), whose participation as vital to the long-term continuity of
              research in the field.

Polymer diffraction techniques provide the basis of
              much of our structural understanding of this important class of materials.
