              ABSTRACT

OCE-0217902

Twelve estuarine biogeochemists will be selected from
              the U.S. scientific community to participate in the 7th International Estuarine
              Biogeochemistry Symposium to be held in Grimstad, Norway in May, 2002.  During
              this meeting, special emphasis will be placed on discussions regarding new
              results on the biogeochemistry of high and low latitude fjords.  In addition,
              the biogeochemistry of arctic, tropical, sub-tropical and temperate estuaries
              also will be addressed.  Thematically, the symposium will discuss issues such
              as interactions between organic matter and trace metals, redox boundaries,
              nutrient control on productivity, climate change effects, experimental design
              of mesocosms, modeling of sediment-water exchange and new sampling techniques. 
              Results from the symposium will be published most likely in a special edition
              of  the journal Marine Chemistry.
