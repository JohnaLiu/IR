ABSTRACT

The proposed project is on the
              dynamical behavior of colloidal particles suspended in liquid confined within a
              narrow channel.  This arrangement provides an experimental setup to investigate
              the particle transport characteristics in one-dimensional pores.   It is shown
              that the presence of nearby walls affects the drag on a translating particle
              where interactions among particles produce non-Fickian transport within a pore.
               The experiments are designed to investigate the characteristics of
              one-dimensional diffusion, difficult to analyze theoretically in this
              complicated geometry and in realistic applications.   The goal is to obtain new
              information about transport in confined geometry not anticipated from existing
              theories.  The proposed project will shed light on the size of the particles
              (relative to the channel dimensions) for transport to be described by a
              one-dimensional diffusion model.
