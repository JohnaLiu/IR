Abstract    :
              Large columnar cacti, such as the saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea), are prominent
              features of many ecosystems. Because of their extensive distribution and
              abundant production of large succulent fruit they play an important role in
              structuring food webs and ecosystems. This research assesses the importance of
              the saguaro's fruit as a food and water resource to a desert bird community in
              the Sonoran Desert of Arizona and Mexico. Naturally occurring carbon and
              hydrogen stable isotope signatures of the saguaro's fruit are used to track the
              movement of nutrients and water from the plant into the bird community. This
              project will provide new insight the role of cacti as consumer resources in
              arid and semi-arid ecosystems and provide direct measurements of frugivory and
              nutrient transfer rates between the saguaro and animals that consume its
              fruits.
