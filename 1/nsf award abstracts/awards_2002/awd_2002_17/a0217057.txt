This award provides
              partial support for active research mathematicians 
with limited means of
              support to attend and participate in the
Workshop on "Geometry and Topology of
              Quotients" to be held at the 
University of Arizona in December of 2002. The
              main speakers are 
Igor Dolgachev (Michigan), Mikhail Kapranov (Toronto)*,
              
Janos Kollar (Princeton)*, Robert MacPherson (IAS and Princeton)*,
Jun Li
              (Stanford), Reyer Sjamaar (Cornell), (* - to be confirmed). The 
plenary
              lectures will survey recent progress and current directions of
research in
              Geometric Invariant theory and Symplectic Reductions,
explain connections with
              other disciplines and applications to physics. In 
addition to principal
              lectures, there will be sessions of contributed
talks and round-table
              discussions. The workshop will provide a forum for 
young researchers to meet
              and interact with leading specialists as well
as for interactions across the
              traditional boundaries of
disciplines. Women and minority researchers are
              encouraged to participate. Further 
information is available at
