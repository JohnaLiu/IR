Tilton
This award supports Robert Tilton and a student from Carnegie
              Mellon University in a collaboration with Per Claesson of the Department of
              Chemistry at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.  The
              project will focus on manipulation of the molecular-level structure of adsorbed
              polymer layers on solid surfaces.  The manipulation is achieved by introducing
              surfactants hat bind with varying affinities to different segments of the
              polymer as it adsorbs.  Particular attention will be paid to non-equilibrium
              configurations in the adsorbed layers and to the dynamics of their
              transformations.  The goal is to develop techniques to design long-lived
              metastable layer configurations that are optimized for technological
              applications.  The collaboration combines the distinct, but highly
              complementary, approaches taken by the Swedish and US groups:  the US side uses
              optical and spectroscopic methods to characterize composition and
              micro-environmental aspects of adsorbed layers and the Swedish side uses
              surface force measurement to characterize the structure and mechanics of the
              layers.  A key aspect of the collaboration is the initiation of a graduate
              student exchange between the US and Swedish groups.
