Abstract    :
              This dissertation research conducts an comparative study of the agricultural
              productivity of Removal Period (1835-1838) Cherokee Indian farmers and white
              farmers who later cultivated the same land.  At this time, the argument for
              removal revolved around the inefficient agricultural practices used by the
              Cherokee.  Using the stochastic distance frontier approach, the technical
              efficiency, as well as other productivity measures, for each Cherokee and white
              household can be estimated.  Yet, the goal for this research is not to justify
              an antiquated policy, but to examine the variation of efficiency across
              Cherokee farms as well as between these two groups.  By isolating the
              differences between Cherokee and white societies, this study will strengthen
              our understanding of Indian/White relations at this particular juncture. The
              data collection and analysis will add greatly to the dearth of economic studies
              on Native Americans.  Despite a vast literature on Cherokee acculturation and
              removal, this project is the first large-scale comparative study of the
              agricultural performance between these two groups.
