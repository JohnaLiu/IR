Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the development of automatic process control (APC)
              methodologies based on Design of Experiments (DOE) regression models and
              real-time measurement or estimation of noise factors.  The central idea of the
              proposed research is to develop a methodology to achieve automatic process
              control by integrating the disciplines of DOE, SPC, and control and estimation
              theory.  Various fundamental issues will be studied, which include: (1) a new
              classification of controllable factors and noise factors applicable to serve as
              feedback information for APC; (2) test design and analysis of DOE for process
              modeling with consideration of system identifiability for the control purpose;
              (3) cautious control strategy with consideration of uncertainties in DOE
              regression models and noise factor estimation; and (4) on-line DOE model
              updating and adaptive control with supervision.

The success of the research
              will lead to a new scientific basis and practical tools for designing and
              implementing APC in complex manufacturing processes.  The research expands the
              existing theory in each of the three well-developed disciplines of DOE, SPC,
              and APC to form a new "DOE-based APC" methodology.  This new methodology, in
              conjunction with robust design and SPC, will provide more effective techniques
              for a broad range of manufacturing processes.  Examples of such processes
              include stamping, forging, semiconductor, and composite material manufacturing
              processes.
