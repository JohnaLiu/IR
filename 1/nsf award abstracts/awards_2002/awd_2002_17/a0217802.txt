Abstract    :
              This award provides support for student attendance at the 2002 Gordon Conference
              on Multiphoton Processes.  The Conference will discuss topics such as high
              harmonic generation, ultrafast processes, wave packet dynamics, and high-field
              laser-matter interactions.
