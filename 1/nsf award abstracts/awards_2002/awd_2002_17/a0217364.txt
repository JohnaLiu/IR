Abstract    :
              The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Compact High
              Performance Cooling Technologies will address research and development needs of
              industries in the area of high-performance heat removal from compact spaces. 
              All product sectors in the electronics industry (High-Performance,
              Cost/Performance, Telecommunications, Hand-held, Automotive, and
              Military/Avionics) face critical electronics cooling challenges, and the Center
              brings together faculty from the Schools of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical
              and Computer Engineering and Aeronautics and Astronautics at Purdue University,
              and contribute complimentary competencies in heart transfer, microfluidics,
              microfabrication, refrigeration, computational techniques, mechatronics,
              controls, acoustics, sensing and actuation and diagnostics and measurements.
