Abstract    :
              A team of researchers from Cornell University (in close collaboration with a
              group from the University of Michigan) will develop advanced sources of
              ultrashort light pulses.  The researchers will exploit a new degree of freedom
              that has recently been demonstrated for short-pulse generation: control of the
              sign and magnitude of effective cubic nonlinearities.  Because cubic nonlinear
              processes underlie virtually all aspects of modern ultrashort-pulse generation,
              this is a substantial new capability.  
Ultrahigh-intensity lasers capable of
              producing petawatt (1015 W) power levels and intensities as high as 1015 W/cm2
              will benefit from new capabilities in pulse compression, pulse cleaning, and
              compensation of self-focusing and excessive nonlinear phase shifts. The new
              ability to control nonlinear phase shifts is referred to as nonlinearity
              management. 
The new approach to control and generation of intense ultrashort
              pulses is flexible and applicable to a variety of functions.   The proposed
              research is certain to produce new information and understanding of ultrashort
              light pulses.   Substantial impact is expected through the new instruments that
              will be developed.  New ultrahigh-intensity lasers are expected to enable a
              wide variety of scientific studies.  
Students participating in the proposed
              effort will be involved in a highly collaborative effort, with aspects ranging
              from optical engineering to fundamental science.
