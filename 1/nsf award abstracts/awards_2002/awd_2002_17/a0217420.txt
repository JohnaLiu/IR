This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) will
              support Dr. Francisco Zaera of the University of California, Riverside in
              coordination with Dr. Francisco Machado of the Central University of Venezuela
              and Dr. Alfonso Loaiza of the University of the Andes in Merida, Venezuela. The
              main objectives of this PASI are to familiarize advanced graduate students,
              post-doctoral and junior scientists from the Americas on recent advances in
              surface science and catalysis as well as foster new inter-American research
              collaborations. The program will formally introduce beginning scientists to
              modern experimental techniques in surface science and to the latest theoretical
              methods used to study surface chemical phenomena. The proposed activity will be
              followed by a Symposium that will bring together research groups from Latin
              America and the United States to discuss the latest results in surface science
              and catalysis.
