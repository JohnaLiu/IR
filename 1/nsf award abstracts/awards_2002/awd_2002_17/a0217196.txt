Abstract    :
              

The University of Kentucky will to establish a demonstration project called
              the Girls
in Science Program (GIS), to encourage young women from rural
              southeastern Appalachian
Kentucky to pursue careers in science, math,
              engineering and technology (SMET). This three-
year project, to begin in
              September 2002, targets 120 girls entering the seventh-grade 
from 21 rural
              Kentucky Appalachian counties, parents of these girls, and a minimum of 
30
              rural Kentucky Appalachian middle school teachers from these 21 county school
              
districts. This project targets a select group of middle school girls with a
              program that 
involves: 1) Weeklong Summer Institutes for each girl at the
              University of Kentucky campus
for two years, 2) Saturday/After-school sessions
              throughout two academic school years,
and 3) Mentoring relationships with
              University scientists and community mentors. The 
project also the project
              targets middle school math and science teachers through 
professional
              development courses focused on engaging each girl in science and math for 
two
              years. This project will include parental involvement with a series of
              workshops.
The project team will also develop and disseminate a model middle
              school curriculum 
manual focused on institutionalizing the program in rural
              Appalachian Kentucky.  Girls and
teachers who enroll in the program will be
              the primary beneficiaries; however, the program 
is designed to have a
              broad-based impact on other students, teachers, relatives, and 
ultimately
              rural Kentucky and Appalachia.
