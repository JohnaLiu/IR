Abstract    :
              The Dissertations Initiative for the Advancement of Limnology and OceanoGraphy
              (DIALOG) is an interdisciplinary project that works through several
              professional societies to target recent Ph.D. recipients across the full
              spectrum of disciplines relevant to the biologically oriented aquatic sciences.
              This project will quantify and characterize recent aquatic science Ph.D.s,
              consolidate and disseminate Ph.D. dissertation abstracts, establish electronic
              lists to facilitate distribution of job opportunities, and run an international
              "capstone" symposium for selected recent graduates to foster interdisciplinary
              insight, peer networking, and early career development.  DIALOG will foster
              international as well as inter?institutional contacts, and include graduates
              from both developing and developed countries. Demographic data will facilitate
              the characterization and tracking of human resources. The on?line Dissertation
              Registry will provide a comprehensive yet concise summary of new research for
              scientists, policy makers, and agency representatives and facilitates
              integration of a new generation of researchers into the broader community. The
              electronic distribution list will provide a mechanism to target and disseminate
              information across institutions and foster communication across disciplinary
              and international boundaries. The international symposium will support
              participant diversity at all levels, and bring together individuals whose work
              transcends traditional boundaries. Activities will establish peer networks and
              enhance insights and perspectives to accelerate career development and advance
              interdisciplinary approaches to science.
