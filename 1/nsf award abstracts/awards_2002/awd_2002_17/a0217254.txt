Abstract    :
              This award is to organize a workshop entitled "Scaling New Heights" to be held
              at the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center on May 20 and 21, 2002.  The NSF PACI
              leading-edge centers (NCSA, PSC, SDSC) together with the Center for
              Computational Sciences (ORNL) and NERSC, will jointly organize the workshop
              which will examine issues involved in scaling applications to thousands of
              processors.  

The goal of this workshop is to examine practical mechanisms
              for scaling these applications to closely coupled high-end distributed memory
              architectures.
