Abstract    :
              An insect hormone called bursicon is essential for hardening of the new skin
              (cuticle) after the insect has shed its old one during molting (ecdysis).  The
              timed release and actions of bursicon are critically important for the survival
              of all insects and, most likely, all arthropods.  Although bursicon was
              discovered in 1935 and is known to be a peptide, its molecular structure has
              not been established, and remains a major unsolved problem in insect
              neuroendocrinology.  The Honegger lab has purified the hormone and obtained
              partial amino acid sequences for bursicon from some insects.  Recently they
              were able to use these sequences to identify a particular gene sequence,
              CG13419, in the genome of the fruitfly Drosophila.  The primary aim of this
              collaborative project is to determine whether the CG13419 gene product is the
              functional bursicon hormone, as an important step to understanding the actions
              of bursicon.  Molecular techniques for gene expression in eukaryotic cells and
              overexpression in Drosophila will be combined with the 'ligated fly' bioassay
              using the related blowfly (Sarcophaga) to test for bursicon activity.  If
              bioactive bursicon is shown, the sequence will be used for cDNA screening in
              the moth Manduca, a well-studied insect system in which the complex hormonal
              interactions regulating ecdysis have been illuminated.  From the recombinant
              proteins and synthesized peptides from conserved sequence stretches, new
              antibodies will be produced to identify neurosecretory cells in the brain, and
              to clarify the temporal and spatial activation of bursicon release in
              Manduca.
   Results from this work will provide a potential breakthrough for
              understanding how the brain and endocrine systems together orchestrate multiple
              biochemical events leading to periodic cuticular hardening.  Knowledge about
              this key hormone may provide novel strategies for agriculture in developing
              insect pest controls, and in managing crustacean aquaculture.  In addition,
              this collaboration between two institutions includes multi-disciplinary
              postdoctoral training.
