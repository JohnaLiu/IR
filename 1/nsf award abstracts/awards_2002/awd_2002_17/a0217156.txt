Abstract    :
              Our world is composed of many ethnic communities in diaspora, each maintaining
              to a different degree a sense of identity related to their culture of origin.
              This research by cultural anthropologists studies patterns of variation in the
              cultural identity of Welsh communities. The current research adds two
              communities, one in Patagonia (Argentina) which retains the Welsh language and
              a variety of other cultural practices, and one in Ohio where Welsh-Americans
              live in self-consciously Welsh communities, but without retaining the language.
              The new information from this project will be integrated with that from
              previous studies of Welsh communities in Australia and Iowa as well as Wales.
              Hypotheses dealing with the importance of language, ethnic museums,
              performances, innovation in traditional institutions, and cultural exchange
              with Wales will be tested.  Using a variety of methods including in-depth
              interviews and consensus analysis, a statistical technique that describes
              patterns of agreement and disagreement among individuals, the study will
              advance our understanding of the cultural construction of identity among
              diaspora communities. The broader impacts of the research will be important as
              the project will allow us to better understand how identity politics works in
              relation to cultural visibility.
