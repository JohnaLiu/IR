Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funding for partial support for a joint U.S. ECOHAB-European
              EUROHAB workshop. The goal of the workshop is to bring scientists from the U.S.
              and the European community together to exchange information on harmful algal
              events, identify high priority research topics for collaborative efforts, and
              to specify research objectives and approaches to developing a predictive
              understanding of harmful algal blooms. The Europeans are requesting comparable
              funding from the European Union (EU) for this effort. The workshop is to be
              held in September 2002, along the northern Adriatic, with 30-40 scientists in
              attendance.
