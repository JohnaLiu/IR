Abstract    :
              Over the past decade, wireless sensor networks have evolved from primarily
              unidirectional star networks into a wide variety of forms, with large-scale
              research programs and significant commercialization activity.  These systems
              will increasingly connect the physical world to wide-area networks for
              monitoring and control purposes including homeland defense and industrial
              applications.  Yet relatively little is known on the fundamental limits to how
              efficiently a network can glean useful information from the environment to
              process it and relay it to the larger public network.  Research is being
              conducted on fundamental limits in four areas: the rate distortion region for
              correlated sources, capacity for distributed nodes, packet delay across
              networks, and the dependability of heterogeneous wireless networks.  These four
              topics collectively address many of the important parameters in sensor network
              design and will allow practical algorithms to be tested against fundamental
              limits.
