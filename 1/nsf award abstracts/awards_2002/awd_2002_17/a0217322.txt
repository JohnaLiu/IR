Abstract    :
              The Center for Bibliographical Studies at the University of California,
              
Riverside, is creating a union catalog of Latin American imprints to 
1851. 
              Existing printed bibliographies are for the most part old and 
incomplete or
              non-existent.  The Center has keyed all the extant 
bibliographies and
              catalogs it can identify that are within scope, 
producing some over 85,000
              separate entries.  Under this grant the keyed 
entries will be modifed to fit
              MARC standards, duplicate holdings 
eliminated and holdings records
              consolidated forming an initial data base 
of 60-70,000 records.  Uniform
              library symbols will be created.  The 
resulting file will be mounted in the
              Research Libraries Information 
Network for public access.  The process of
              adding additional records from 
machine-readable files submitted by
              participating libraries in North and 
South America will begin, matching
              algorithms developed, and new holdings 
and records as well as citations to
              microfilm facsimiles added.  Scholars 
will have access to a single source for
              identifying surviving imprints and 
where they can be found.  The file itself
              will be searchable across all 
fields through Boolean searching.  Libraries
              will be able to use the file 
for copy cataloging and obtaining
              machine-readable records of their 
holdings for loading into their online
              public catalogs.
