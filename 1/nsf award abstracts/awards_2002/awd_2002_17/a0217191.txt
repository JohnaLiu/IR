Abstract    :
              Sugars are evolutionarily conserved signaling molecules that control many vital
              developmental processes and physiological responses from bacteria, yeasts,
              mammals, to plants. Extensive cellular and transgenic studies have provided
              compelling evidence that plant hexokinase (HXK), a sugar-binding enzyme, acts
              as a sugar sensor with both signaling and metabolic functions. To further
              elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the plant sugar-signaling
              network, a genetic approach has been taken to isolate sugar response mutants
              using Arabidopsis as a plant model. Based on a phenotypic assay in which a high
              level of glucose blocks the switch of post-germination development in
              Arabidopsis, both glucose insensitive (gin) and glucose over-sensitive (glo)
              mutants have been isolated. Genetic, phenotypic and molecular characterizations
              of these glucose-signaling mutants (gin1, gin2, gin4, gin5 & gin6) and their
              corresponding genes have provided many surprising new insights into the
              regulatory mechanisms connecting nutrient status to plant hormone biosynthesis
              and signaling. 

Currently, the most important sugar response mutant that is
              directly linked to glucose sensing and signaling is gin2 with HXK1 deficiency.
              The study of other HXK and HXK-like (HKL) genes, the characterization of gin2
              suppressor mutants, the analysis of HXK1-mediated global gene expression using
              functional genomic tools, and the understanding of interactions between glucose
              and hormone signaling pathways will advance our knowledge on the molecular
              mechanisms underlying the regulatory roles of sugar signals in plant growth and
              development. Since sugar production and consumption constitutes the most
              fundamental activities of plant life in growth, reproduction and storage, and
              is tightly linked to environmental conditions and factors, understanding the
              molecular basis of sugar signaling network may help design new strategies for
              improvements in agriculture. The study of metabolic signaling mechanisms also
              offers excellent training opportunities for researchers, postdoctoral
              associates and graduate and undergraduate students especially from
              underrepresented groups in science.

Future research plans have four
              objectives:
1) Functional analysis of HXK and HXK-like (HKL) genes
2)
              Genetic, phenotypic and molecular analysis of gin2 suppressor mutants    
3)
              Global gene expression and functional analyses of HXK-regulated genes 
4)
              Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between
              glucose and hormone signaling

Although the broad effects of sugars on plant
              growth and development have been known for decades, the molecular mechanisms of
              sugar signaling network have only been recently discovered. The sugar
              regulatory pathways are directly and extensively connected to multiple
              hormonal, metabolic, and stress signaling pathways and are modulate by
              environmental factors that determine the output of adaptive and flexible growth
              and development in plants. The discoveries have generated significant impact on
              basic and applied scientific research and have altered traditional concepts on
              metabolic regulation in plants. The intellectual contribution to our
              understanding of fundamental control of plant life will have practical
              applications from the improved production of plant fiber, food, medicine and
              alternative and renewable energy resources to the manipulation of environmental
              and ecological systems including the modulation of global CO2 sinks.
