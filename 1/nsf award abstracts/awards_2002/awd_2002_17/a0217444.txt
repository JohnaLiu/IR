Abstract    :
              Effects of plant functional identity on ecosystem nitrogen retention following
              fire

Recent warming trends and increased human activities have led to
              documented increases in fire occurrence in North American boreal forests. 
              Forest productivity in the boreal biome is generally limited by the
              availability of nitrogen (N), and increased fire frequency causes increased
              opportunity for N to be lost from the ecosystem via combustion and post-fire
              losses to the atmosphere and water.  Understanding controls over these N losses
              following fire is important for predicting the long-term consequences of
              increased fire frequency for forest productivity and carbon cycling.  In this
              proposal, the investigators hypothesize that the functional traits of the plant
              species that initially colonize burned ecosystems will control the ability of
              the ecosystem to accumulate carbon and thus retain N following fire.  The
              researchers will test this hypothesis with a study of N loss in a boreal black
              spruce forest that burned in June 1999.  The research approach will entail an
              ecosystem-scale addition of a stable N isotope that can be tracked, combined
              with experimental manipulation of plant colonization.
