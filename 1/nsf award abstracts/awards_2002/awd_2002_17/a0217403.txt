STRESS, SPINES & NEW MEMORIES
 
Dendritic spines are
              tiny protrusions that exist by the tens of thousands on many excitatory neurons
              in the brain, including those in the hippocampal formation.  Spines are
              potential sites of synapse formation and thus represent a means for neuronal
              integration.  Based on their potential for conferring associations between
              neurons, it has been hypothesized that they are involved in the encoding of
              experience.  Exposure to an acute stressful experience greatly increases the
              density of dendritic spines in the hippocampal formation of the male rat. This
              effect is robust and persistent - lasting at least 24 hrs after the event has
              ceased.  The effect is also regionally specific in that it is evident on
              pyramidal neurons in area CA1 of the hippocampus but not in the somatosensory
              cortex.  The primary goal of the proposed experiments is to identify the
              neuronal and hormonal mechanisms that are responsible for the
              experience-induced change in spine density.  Specifically, experiments will be
              done to determine whether activation of the NMDA type of glutamate receptors is
              necessary for inducing the persistent increase in spine density.  It will also
              be determined whether the presence of the major stress hormones,
              glucocorticoids, is necessary for the stress effects on synaptic anatomy. 
              Although dendritic spines were identified over 100 years ago, their functional
              significance has remained elusive.  The results from these studies should
              provide important insight into their functional significance and the mechanisms
              that mediate their plasticity.
