Abstract    :
              The classical Poole-Frenkel (PF) effect is the thermal emission of charge
              carriers from Coulombic attractive traps in the bulk of dielectrics and
              semiconductors, enhanced by an electric field.  This mechanism results in
              higher than ideal currents in electronic materials, including leakage currents
              in conventional dielectrics, Si3N4 and SiO2; leakage in high dielectric
              constant materials such as Ta2O5 and BaSrTiO3, which hold great promise as gate
              dielectrics in DRAMs and MOSFETs; and enhanced current in Silicon Carbide (SiC)
              diodes.  The research objective is to investigate advanced models of the PF
              effect and experimental techniques to characterize PF conduction in electronic
              devices and materials.  Our primary goals are:  (i) Investigate a PF model
              using the Fermi-Dirac function to describe the trap population statistics,
              while still incorporating the Boltzmann approximation for the free electron
              density.  Model the current at voltages above saturation.  (ii) Investigate
              this model as a function of temperature.  Determine if it predicts convergence
              of I-V(T) curves at saturation, as our earlier research suggests.  (iii)
              Investigate the implications of this model on our technique for measuring
              saturation and trap ionization potential.  (iv) Fabricate MIS structures with
              Ta2O5, measure I-V(T) curves looking for saturation, and verify our general
              technique.  (v) Use the Fermi-Dirac function to describe both trap and free
              electron population statistics for the first time.  (vi) Incorporate the model
              in a commercial simulator, and simulate 6H-SiC p-n diodes.  This research will
              enhance our understanding of the PF effect, and improve the accuracy of
              modeling this effect in electronic devices.
