Abstract    :
              

Unlike typical eukaryotic taxa, Bacteria and Archaea are thought to evolve
              primarily through gene acquisition, that is, through the transfer of DNA
              between distantly related organisms. Such horizontal gene transfer occurs at
              high rates in many bacterial lineages, and virtually all prokaryotic genomes
              show a substantial fraction of recently acquired sequences. This project will
              extend our current understanding of the impact of horizontal gene transfer on
              the evolution of microbial genomes by examining constraints on DNA transfer
              between taxa. First, methods for detecting and quantifying recently acquired
              genetic material will be refined and extended by integrating identification of
              atypical genes (those not conforming to chromosome-wide sequence patterns) with
              detection of phylogenetic incongruencies. Second, these approaches will be used
              to develop a framework for understanding how and why the rate of successful
              gene transfer varies among species - that is, why some organisms are better DNA
              recipients; here organisms containing large amounts of low-value information
              may be more likely to accept horizontally transferred DNA since the incoming
              genes will be more likely to confer a benefit. Lastly, the probability of
              successful DNA transfer will be examined from a functional standpoint: that is,
              can chromosome structure impose a physical barrier to lateral transfer between
              distantly related organisms? Direct experimentation will test the roles of
              skewed, asymmetrically-distributed sequences in stalling replication forks, and
              computational analyses will determine if the strength of this barrier (the
              differences in these sets of sequences) increases with overall phylogenetic
              distance.
