Morin and Covich 

This proposal requests funds to support travel
              to Switzerland for a joint European/ US workshop to examine biodiversity and
              ecosystem function in aquatic systems. This is an area that has not received as
              much attention in aquatic systems as it has in terrestrial systems.  The
              Ecology program specifically encouraged inclusion of marine participants in the
              proposed workshop. More than half of the attendees supported by NSF Funds are
              junior participants (grad students, post-docs and young faculty), and 50% of
              these were women.  The workshop will also foster international collaborations
              between groups of scientists that have had relatively little interaction.
