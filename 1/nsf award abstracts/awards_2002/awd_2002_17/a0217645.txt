Abstract    :
              This project  will develop an online reference guide, called "Pathfinder,"
              primarily for non-technical audiences, including undergraduate and graduate
              students. This guide will enable users to gain an overview of the power and
              energy field in pursuit of educational opportunities and resources. Developed
              in conjunction with IEEE's Virtual Community on Power and Energy, this tool
              will aggregate quality resources and provide an orderly process for discovery. 
              Recourses will include publications from the IEEE and other sources, as well as
              "knowledge or learning objects" found in online collections, including the
              NSF-funded DLNET collection.  These objects will include publications and other
              resources that define the field of power and energy, its attendant industries,
              and specialized technical and applications areas. IEEE staff and volunteers
              from the IEEE Educational Activities will work with other volunteers from the
              IEEE Power Engineering Society and the IEEE Industry Application Society.  They
              will also work with staff from IEEE Press and Wiley to identify and possibly
              make available resources for the user community. The IEEE Virtual Community on
              Power and Energy will provide the online platform for developing and reviewing
              this tool.
