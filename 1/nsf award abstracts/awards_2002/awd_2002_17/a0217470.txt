Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project is an ethnographic analysis of the ethical
              and aesthetic commitments of free software computer hackers. It addresses the
              following questions: 1) How do free software hacker practices, legal codes, and
              social values reconfigure normative meanings of scientific knowledge, property,
              and creativity? 2) How do hackers' ethical commitments result from the
              interplay between their particular technical and aesthetic practices and the
              wider socio-economic and legal conditions that shape their
activities? 3) What
              is materially and symbolically at stake in differing conceptions of knowledge
              production and protection? The free software movement, whose goal is to make
              software and its source code legally available, challenges the legal
              privatization of software production. Free software is developed by thousands
              of volunteer hackers. Working collectively over the Internet, they hold legal,
              open access to information indispensable to their craft, understood as a social
              practice and expressive activity fusing technological innovation with artistic
              creation. This research combines ethnographic and document-analysis research by
              following one software project and participation in a range of forums and
              conferences in the Bay Area. The researcher asks how knowledge, property, and
              creativity are reconceived by hackers, and she seeks to understand how their
              aims and practices emerged from specific institutional conditions at a
              particular historical moment.
