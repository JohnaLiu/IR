Abstract    :
              This award is to support research that will develop a 400,000 year record of
              wet-dry conditions from the northern Andes using a multiproxy analysis of
              sediments accumulated in the Caribbean Sea.

Ocean Drilling Program (ODP)
              Site 999 is located over the delta of the Magdalena River and receives
              terrestrial sediment from the northern Andes.  Analysis of foraminifers,
              dynoflagellates, charcoal, and stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen will allow
              reconstruction of moisture balance.

The broader impacts of this proposed
              research are that it will lead to a better understanding of tropical climate
              conditions during glacials and provide baseline information on the movement of
              the inter-tropical convergence zone during the Quaternary.  Ultimately, data
              generated by this research will be used to improve model predictions of changes
              in the terrestrial carbon reservoir.
