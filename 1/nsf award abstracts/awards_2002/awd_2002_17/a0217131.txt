Description: This award is to support a collaborative
              project between Dr. Nils Fernelius, Physicist, Dr. David Zelmon, Electrical
              Engineer, both in the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Air Force
              Research Laboratory (AFRL) at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio and Dr.
              Kerim Allahverdi, Senior Scientist, Materials and Chemical Technologies
              Institute, the Turkish Scientific and Technical Research Council (TUBITAK),
              Marmara Research Center (MRC), Gebze-Kocaeli, Turkey.  The investigators plan
              to make precise measurements of the ordinary and extraordinary refractive
              indices at various infrared wavelengths for pure and doped Galium Selenide
              (GaSe), so that reliable Sellmeier equations can be constructed.  These
              equations are used in the design of various optical devices such as second
              harmonic generators and optical parametric oscillators. 

Scope: 
The U.S
              team has unique capabilities to measure the refractive indices.  The Turkish
              team has expert capability in sample growing and polishing.  Both of these
              capabilities are needed to achieve the research goals.  In this cooperative
              research the staff of the MRC will manufacture GaSe samples as specified by the
              AFRL staff.  These samples will be used by the latter in making precision
              measurements of the index refraction and to construct the Sellmeier equations. 
              The process will be repeated to narrow the differences between the measured and
              calculated indices.  One of the two U.S. PIs will visit MRC to compare the
              results of the Sellemeier equations from the obtained data.
