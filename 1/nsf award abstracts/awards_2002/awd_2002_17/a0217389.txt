In recent years, increasing interest in
              ultrahigh-pressure research results primarily from the unique possibility to
              simulate in the laboratory the conditions that are characteristic of deep
              geological environments. The primary tool for achieving static pressures above
              about 25 GPa is the diamond anvil cell (DAC). Apart from isothermal compression
              studies, the DAC can also be used for in-situ experiments from room pressure to
              several megabars at temperatures from close to 0 K to several thousands of
              degrees. Most structure analysis at pressures above about 10 GPa has been
              limited to polycrystalline samples because the technology for single-crystal
              diffraction studies at higher pressures is not well-developed. This project
              will extend the pressure capability of single-crystal structure analysis from
              10 to 120 GPa and even higher pressures. This pressure region is
              extraordinarily rich in phenomena that dramatically change electronic,
              magnetic, thermal, elastic, and bonding properties of materials. Precise
              determination of atomic positions and electron distributions accompanying these
              changes is the key for understanding the processes. The experimental and
              computational techniques we are planning to develop will make possible
              ultrahigh-pressure crystal-structure studies with both laboratory-based and
              synchrotron x-ray sources. With new developments in sample gaskets, pressure
              media, diamond anvils, backing plates, and diamond cell design, we will be able
              to bring a >(10 ?m)3 sample of an unstrained single crystal to the pressures
              stated above.  Experiments based on these developments will provide definitive
              long-sought answers to important scientific questions in Earth, planetary, and
              materials sciences, including the fundamental changes of silicates, oxides,
              ices, and condensed gases that are the main components of deep planetary
              interiors.
