Abstract    :
              This conference is designed to assist key university and college leaders, those
              with responsibility for institution-wide undergraduate education, in adopting
              tested strategies to implement programs of change in STEM curriculum and
              pedagogy on their campuses. The focus is on ways to implement change and
              demonstrate its effectiveness.

The program acquaints participants with a
              sense of what some of the exciting new pedagogies and technologies are and how
              to infuse these innovations into the curriculum. Presenters for the workshop
              detail the ways in which these innovations can be applied to several fields and
              then demonstrate how they use them in their own teaching. They discuss what
              worked and what failed in the process of implementation. Attendees will leave
              with both general ideas and the specifics of a particular application.
              Opportunities for interaction with industrial education leaders is
              included.

The expected outcome is to have a group of leaders who can return
              to their campuses energized and with a better understanding of how to implement
              these changes within the curriculum.
