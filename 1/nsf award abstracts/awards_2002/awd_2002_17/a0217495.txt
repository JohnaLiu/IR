Abstract    :
              	This dissertation investigates how appropriate social networks help explain the
              relative success of four conservation and development projects in two regions
              in Brazil. The mobilization of multiple stakeholders, both local and beyond the
              project region, are critical for sustainable development.  These networks also
              help diffuse a new identity supporting environmentally sustainable resource
              use.  Both mobilization and diffusion depend on overlapping ties among the
              various stakeholders.  Ethnographic and interview methods will be used to
              collect data on network connections and the flow of resources through those
              networks.
