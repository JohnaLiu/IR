Abstract    :
              POWER SHIFT:  A Proposal to Augment the Performance of Girls in SMET
              Studies

In keeping with the mission to educate children and families,
              encourage
creativity, and challenge all learners in new and innovative ways,
              the Maine Discovery
Museum plans out-of-school-time programs that will
              increase competence in science and
mathematics and promote technological
              fluency for middle school students. With the
passage of a landmark initiative
              by the 119th Maine State Legislature that equips all 7th
and 8th grade
              students with laptop computers, MDM plans programs that will expand the
use of
              laptop computers beyond the school day, encourage parent involvement,
              and
convey fresh ways of learning and teaching math and science. With a
              history of
providing exhibits and educational programs that are based on
              recognized learning
theories and that accommodate a wide-range of learning
              styles, we have an excellent
opportunity to implement project-based activities
              that encourage creative problem
solving, social interaction, and group
              communication. We believe these program
ingredients, along with staff
              development workshops that focus on gender equity issues,
will foster improved
              achievement and greater participation by females in SMET
professions.
