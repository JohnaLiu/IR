This
              project is to have a 2-day workshop along with the first APEC Ocean-related
              Ministerial Meeting with the theme of "Towards the Sustainability of Marine and
              Coastal Resources" to be held in Seoul, Korea on April 22 and 26, 2002. The
              Fourth Meeting of the U.S.-Korea Joint Committee on Scientific and Technical
              Cooperation was held on September 18, 2000. At that meeting a cooperative
              program was defined related to technical cooperation in the development of a
              Deep Water Unmanned Underwater Vehicle. This project results from that effort.
              The workshop will be held in Daejon, Korea jointly funded by KOSEF in Korea and
              NSF in U.S. The subject of the workshop is Deep Water Unmanned Underwater
              Vehicle Technology,
