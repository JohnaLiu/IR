This award supports a three-year collaborative research
              project between Professor Alvan Hengge, with the Department of Chemistry and
              Biochemistry at Utah State University, and Professor Ikenna Onyido, with the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Agriculture, in Makurdi, Nigeria. 
              They will study the reaction mechanisms of phosphonothioates.  

Phosphoryl
              group transfer from a variety of phosphorylated compounds is involved in energy
              transport and control mechanisms in biological systems, and is critical to
              genetic engineering techniques.  For a complete understanding of enzymatic
              catalysis of phosphoryl transfer, it is necessary to know the characterization
              of the transition state for the reaction.  The investigators will measure
              linear free energy relationships and heavy-atom kinetic isotope effects in
              order to delineate the hydrolysis mechanisms of a family of thiophosphonic
              esters, of the general formula compounds Me2P(S)-OAr, MePhP(S)-OAr, and
              Ph2P(S)-OAr. The results are expected to reveal how the hydrolytic mechanism
              depends upon the basicity of the leaving group, as well as the comparative
              behavior of a group of substrates that function as, or are structurally related
              to, pesticides and neurotoxins.  This project is at the interface of chemistry
              and biology, and the results are expected to advance the current knowledge
              about biological phosphoryl transfer at the molecular level.  It combines
              Professor Hengge's knowledge of enzymatic and nonenzymatic phosphoryl transfer
              mechanisms, and Professor Onyido's expertise in the areas of mechanistic
              analysis and linear free energy relationships.
