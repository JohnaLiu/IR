Description:  This award supports a US-India
              collaborative research project in mechanical engineering entitled Magnetic
              Field Assisted Finishing Process.  The investigators are Ranga Komanduri of
              Oklahoma State University (OSU) and Vijay Jain of the Indian Institute of
              Technology, Kanpur (IITK).  The primary focus of their research is the
              finishing of advanced materials by magnetic field assisted polishing.  Their
              collaborative work  will have a direct impact on ultra-precision machining and
              finishing of advanced materials.  This is an area of high current interest and
              will contribute to fundamental understanding of the ultra-precision machining
              process.  

Scope:  The US PI is a recognized leader in the development of
              magnetic float technology and has established a state-of-the-art research
              facility at OSU.  They have been one of the most active groups in the finishing
              of advanced materials in the U.S. The Indian PI, an expert in magnetic abrasive
              finishing processes, is also well recognized for his work in manufacturing. 
              Their collaboration will advance technologies in each of their complementary
              areas and, by taking advantage of their combined knowledge base, they intend to
              extend their studies to a new technology, the magnetorheological abrasive flow
              finishing of advanced materials.  This project will support an international
              experience for a US graduate student and result in stronger cooperation between
              OSU and the IIT,Kanpur.  This project is jointly funded by the Office of
              International Science and Engineering and the Division of Design, Manufacture,
              & Industrial Innovation.
