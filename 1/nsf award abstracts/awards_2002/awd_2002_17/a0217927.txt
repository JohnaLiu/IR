Abstract    :
              This grant concerns the development of a statistical procedure for testing the
              quality of a feasible candidate solution for an important class of stochastic
              programs.  Quality is defined via the so-called optimality gap and the output
              of the procedure is a confidence interval on this gap.  Monte Carlo
              simulation-based tools will be employed to make the procedure efficient and to
              tighten the width of the resulting confidence interval.  The method is not tied
              to specific solution algorithms.  Hence, success will result in an approach
              that can be widely adopted for solving real-world stochastic
              programs.

Stochastic programming is a powerful tool for making decisions in
              complex systems that contain significant uncertainties.  Stochastic programming
              problems arise in many areas of application including financial planning,
              production capacity planning, managing natural resources, communications
              networks, and national security.  Success with the proposed work will enable
              analysts to efficiently assess the quality of candidate solutions to such
              problems.
