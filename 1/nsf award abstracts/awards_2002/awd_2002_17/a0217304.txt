Abstract    :
              Early swimming in planktonic development provides a system for testing
              hypotheses on advantages of the water column rather than the benthos as a
              habitat for animals early in their life histories. Diverse marine animals
              release eggs into the water to develop as solitary planktonic embryos that swim
              early, often while still in embryonic stages. The widespread existence of early
              swimming stages suggests advantages of the water column as a habitat at early
              and vulnerable life history stages.  Solitary embryos deposited on the bottom
              may be at greater risk. Benthic embryos receive greater parental protection,
              further indicating that the benthos is a risky place for solitary embryos. This
              project will answer three questions. Does early swimming remove early embryonic
              stages from benthic predators, despite turbulent mixing? Does early swimming
              reduce capture by common pelagic predators? Are animals at early stages less
              vulnerable to pelagic than to benthic predators?

These questions will be
              addressed through a combination of lab and field studies that assay sinking and
              swimming velocities under turbulent and non-turbulent conditions.  Because
              turbulence turns swimmers away from vertical orientation, experiments will also
              compare vertical bias in turbulence with vertical bias in still water to
              estimate effectiveness of reorientation to the vertical in turbulence.
              Temperature commonly varies with depth, so this project will also measure the
              effect of temperature on rates of sinking and swimming.  Swimming faster than
              sinking could increase encounters with ambush predators, so velocities of
              sinking and swimming will be compared with those of predators relative to
              water, and to predicted turbulence generated shear within predators' perception
              volumes. The hypothesis that swimmers displace water at smaller distances, and
              thus produce a smaller signal to predators than do passive sinkers, will also
              be tested.  Quantifying capture and ingestion of embryos before and after they
              begin to swim will test the hypothesis that swimming decreases successful
              captures per encounter. Predators will include fish larvae, copepods, medusae,
              and ctenophores. Results on vulnerability of preswimming and swimming stages
              will be combined with published data on abundance and clearance rates of
              pelagic and benthic predators to test the hypothesis that animals at early
              stages of development are safer from predation in the water column than near
              the bottom.  Two graduate students will participate in the proposed research in
              their dissertation research, and several undergraduates will participate in the
              research.
