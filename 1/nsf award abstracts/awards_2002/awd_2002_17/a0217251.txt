Abstract    :
              Students in the United States continue to show a significant gender gap in their
              academic achievement in mathematics. One reason for this is that females still
              fall victim to the stereotype of lower math ability; that is, they are
              vulnerable to "stereotype threat." This project applies lessons from research
              on student motivation to understand the academic contexts that can heighten or
              lessen this vulnerability. The research is designed to show that math classes
              conveying the idea that math ability is a fixed trait -- you have it or you
              don't -- will lead females to fall prey to stereotype threat. In contrast, math
              classes that portray math skills as acquirable should defuse the impact of
              stereotypes. Even someone performing poorly now can still gain ability over
              time. This view of math skills, in addition to fostering greater achievement,
              is expected to increase females' enjoyment of math and their sense of belonging
              to the math community.

The research addresses two key moments in students'
              educational lives: the transition to junior high school and to college.
              Educational experiences at these points lay the foundation for future interest
              in science, technology, engineering and math domains, and thus influence the
              career paths women take. The findings will have important implications for
              members of any group who face messages of limited ability in any area of
              achievement.
