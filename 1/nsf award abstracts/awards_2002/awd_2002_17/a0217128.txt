This grant is for a technical support person for the
              stable isotope geochemistry laboratory in the Department of Geological and
              Environmental Sciences at Stanford University.  The grant covers the costs of
              salary for two years.  The stable isotope laboratory has Finnigan-MAT Delta
              plus XR and 252 mass spectrometers, and both are configured for continuous flow
              measurements and have on-line combustion devices for C, H, and N isotope
              analyses of organic matter and minerals.  The Finnigan-MAT 252 also has UV and
              IR lasers and associated extraction lines for the analysis of O isotopes in
              silicate and oxide minerals.  The technical support person will be responsible
              for:  1) assisting in construction of laser lines; 2) routine support and
              maintenance of the mass spectrometers; 3) training of students, postdoctoral
              fellows and faculty in the use of this laboratory; and 4) analysis of samples.
