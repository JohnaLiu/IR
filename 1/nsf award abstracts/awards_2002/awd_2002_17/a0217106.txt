The project is to develop advanced analytical and numerical
              modeling techniques for understanding, analyzing, and predicting combustion
              dynamics in gas-turbine engines for propulsion and power-generation
              applications by international cooperative research with Hankuk Aviation
              Univertsity in Korea. The expected results would provide a general framework
              about various phenomena of combustion dynamics and the models could also serve
              as a backbone for implementing active control schemes.
