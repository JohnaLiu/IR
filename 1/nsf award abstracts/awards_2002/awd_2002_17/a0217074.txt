Abstract    :
              
To foster cross-disciplinary interaction, a conference in nanoparticles and
              nanostructure is planned for the period June 16-21, 2002 in Barga, Italy.  This
              is a relatively small conference being organized thought he United Engineering
              Foundation.  The conference title is "Nanoparticles and Nanostructure Through
              Vapor Phase Synthesis."  A mix of synthesis and applications as, outlined
              below, are planned.

-	Thermal and plasma synthesis of
              nanoparticles
-	Particle Cluster formation and growth processes
-	Advanced
              Characterization
-	Carbonaceous nanomaterials
-	Nanoparticle structure /
              property relationships
-	Catalytic nanostructures
-	Nanostructures in drug
              delivery and biological imaging
-	Electronic Devices (single electron
              transistors)
-	Polymeric composite nanomaterials
-	Other applications.
