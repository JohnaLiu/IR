This proposal requests operating funds for the National Deep
              Submergence Facility (NDSF) during 2002. Resources provided for under this
              proposal include the Human Occupied Deep Submergence Vehicle Alvin, the
              Remotely Operated Vehicles Jason, Medea, Argo and DSL?120. These assets will be
              used to support NSF?sponsored ,oceanographic science programs utilizing the
              engineering and operational personnel of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's
              Deep Submergence Group.

The proposed operating schedule contains a total of
              321 operating days for DSV ALVIN and the ROVs. The DSV days will be supported
              on the R/V ATLANTIS with 13 cruises for the National Science Foundation, The
              facility will also support 3 cruises for National Ocean and Atmospheric
              Administration and one joint cruise for NOAA, NSF and Navy. The ROV days will
              be supported on the R/Vs ATLANTIS and THOMPSON.

These cruises will mainly
              take place in the Pacific Ocean and will range from the Galapagos Islands off
              Ecuador to the Aleutian Islands off Alaska and include waters off Costa Rica,
              Mexico and Canada.
