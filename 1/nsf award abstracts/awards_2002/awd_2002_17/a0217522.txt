This Americas Program award will fund an international
              workshop on robust statistical methods to be held at the Pacific Institute for
              the Mathematical Sciences and the Department of Statistics of the University of
              British Columbia in conjunction with the 2002 International Conference on
              Robust Statistics (ICORS2002).  The workshop, which is being organized on the
              US side by Dr. Arnold J. Stromberg of the University of Kentucky and on the
              Canadian side by Dr. Ruben Zamar of the University of British Colombia, will
              bring together researchers and students in computational robust statistics. The
              Division of Mathematical Sciences is joining in the support of this workshop.
              

Robust statistics deals with the problem that many classical statistical
              procedures work well only for data that comes from a population that is
              normally distributed. Robust statistical procedures, on the other hand, work
              well independently of the normality of the data or even when the data contains
              outliers. The last 25 years have seen tremendous advancements in the theory of
              robust statistics, but many very useful procedures are not used in practice due
              to the fact that they are difficult to compute.  Improved computational methods
              for robust procedures would be beneficial in that current computational methods
              are only practical for small to moderate sized data sets.  Outliers are much
              more likely to appear in larger data sets and thus improvement in computational
              methods will allow robust techniques to be applied to much larger data sets. 

              
The workshop will serve as a forum to develop and share knowledge on improved
              computational techniques that will allow more robust methods to be used in
              practice. A web page on the ICORS2002 will be devoted to discussions related to
              the workshop and drafts of papers will be posted there. An electronic mailing
              list will be used to notify participants of important developments.
