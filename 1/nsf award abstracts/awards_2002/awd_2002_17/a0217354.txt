Abstract    :
              The purpose of the Workship is to examine the influence of alliances, networks
              and partnerships on the innovation process.  This is done to help to help
              statisticians measure activities associated with these linkages, to inform
              policy makers, and to promote discussion in the research community.  It is the
              fifth such Workshop initiated by Statistics Canada and the first in partnership
              with the National Science Foundation.
