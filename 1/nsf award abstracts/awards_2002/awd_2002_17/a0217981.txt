This grant will provides two years partial support for the
              operation of GeoCAMS, the Earth Science component of the FN tandem van de
              Graaff accelerator at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Center for
              Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (CAMS) as a facility for isotopic studies in the
              Earth Sciences. In ten years of successful operation, GeoCAMS has developed and
              demonstrated capabilities to measure 3H, 7,10Be, 26Al, 36Cl, and 129I at levels
              found in terrestrial samples and 41Ca at levels found in meteorites. GeoCAMS
              has measured 15,000 10Be targets, 9400 26Al targets, 9800 36Cl targets, 300
              41Ca targets and a lesser number of 3H, 7Be and 129I targets.  GeoCAMS, built
              with DOE and UC funds, has served numerous NSF PIs, including more than twenty
              during the past year, and has, de facto, come to serve NSF Earth Sciences as a
              facility for AMS measurements. During this time GeoCAMS has played a key role
              in education. Twenty-seven Ph.D. students and seven master's students have been
              trained at GeoCAMS.  The large majority of the new surface exposure dating labs
              set up at U.S. universities during the past few years have been started by
              young faculty trained at GeoCAMS.  In parallel to the facility capability
              supported by this grant, a wide range of Earth science research in
              paleoclimate, ice core research, Earth surface processes and atmospheric mixing
              is carried out by GeoCAMS staff.  The goal of this proposal is to make the
              GeoCAMS facility, which is rated at or near the top of such facilities
              worldwide, available to the NSF Earth Science community while at the same time
              continuing to improve the existing performance and to add capabilities for new
              nuclides, such as in-situ 14C and 53Mn.
