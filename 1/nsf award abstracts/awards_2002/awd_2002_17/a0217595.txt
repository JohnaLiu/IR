                                                       Funds are requested for the purchase
              of a stereoscopic particle imaging (SPIV) system for flow measurements. 
              Proposed projects will include flow in a stirred tank reactor, resuspension of
              bottom sediments, flows in micro-channels, and stratified flows.  These
              projects will be carried out by four members of faculty in Civil and
              Environmental Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Architecture Engineering
              Departments.
