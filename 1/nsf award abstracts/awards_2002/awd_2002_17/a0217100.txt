This award continues Design Projects' activities begun under
              NSF award #9704215 at the University of Alabama, Birmingham (UAB), in which
              students designed and built custom projects for people with disabilities. The
              objectives of the activities are to enhance engineering education, provide
              students with insight into careers in rehabilitation, improve the quality of
              life of people with disabilities, and to serve the community. The previous
              award led to the successful completion of numerous projects and training of
              over 40 undergraduate students in basic design principles. Projects are to be
              featured in regional news media and local television specials, and will be
              described in international symposia. This new project is expected to expand the
              number of design projects and will include students from the new Biomedical
              Engineering (BME) undergraduate program at UAB. The majority of the projects
              are to be conducted in partnership with United Cerebral Palsy (UCP) of
              Birmingham.
