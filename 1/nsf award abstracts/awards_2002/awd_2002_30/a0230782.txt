This award supports a planning visit for developing
              collaborative research work in autonomous robot navigation with researchers at
              Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) in Korea. Autonomous robot
              navigation is one of the key areas in mobile robots that would be used for
              various applications such as vacuuming, remote monitoring, and transporting
              disabled or elderly people.
