TITLE: WMU Collaborative Efforts of College of
              Education and College of Engineering and Applied Science to Enhance Student
              Learning


Abstract

Western Michigan University (WMU) through the
              National Science Foundation Bridges for Engineering
Education (BEE) program 
              will plan and pilot initiatives that provide opportunities for
              increased
interaction among education and engineering faculty and students. 
              

The objectives of the proposed project are: 1) faculty of Colleges of
              Education and Engineering
jointly design an introduction to engineering course
              for engineering and education Students
; 2) faculty of Colleges of Education
              and Engineering jointly hold
seminar and workshop to enhance collaboration,
              including visits to and visits from
representatives of model collaboration
              programs; and 3) The colleges establish a recognition program to award
              excellence in collaboration to improve teaching and learning in
              engineering.
The needs that will be addressed in the proposal project are: (1)
              to enhance technological
literacy of future teachers and to train pre-service
              education students in the use of stimulating
examples of real-world
              engineering and technology to teach mathematics and science to K-12
students;
              (2) to reform first-year engineering course to improve retention of
              first-
year engineering students, and (3) to design practical solutions to
              overcome barriers to collaboration
between the colleges of education and
              engineering.
