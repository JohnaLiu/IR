Abstract    :
              One of the many ambitions of Arizona State University East (ASUE) faculty is to
              motivate and mentor Arizona students to pursue education in science,
              technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Our planning strategy is to
              explore the creation of a consortium of partners from educational institutions
              (ASUE, Pima Community College [PCC], and six high schools in the Sunnyside
              School District); the Arizona Science Center (ASC); and industry collaborators
              (Intel, Microchip, STMicroelectronics, and Texas Instruments) to launch a
              campaign to interest young adults in science and technology disciplines. Their
              objective has been to study the creation of educational pathways and career
              awareness programs for students enrolled in middle school, high school, and
              community college science and math courses that culminate in the completion of
              a Baccalaureate Degree in Engineering Technology/Technology at ASUE. Their goal
              is to improve the educational system in the State of Arizona and to render
              underrepresented Arizona populations (Hispanics, Native and African Americans,
              and women) better equipped to meet the multidisciplinary needs of high
              technology companies.
