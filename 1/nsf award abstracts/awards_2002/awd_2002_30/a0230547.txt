TITLE: Institute for Design Engineering and
              Applications: Fostering Creative Synthesis Across the
              Curriculum

Abstract

The McCormick School of Engineering and Applied
              Science of Northwestern University plan to build a curriculum centered on
              engineering design. They will engage students in a series of meaningful and
              increasingly sophiscated design experiences throughout their undergraduate
              programs.

The design curriculum draws faculty and students together from a
              variety of engineering disciplines, as well as the fine arts and social
              sciences. To facilitate this sort of cross-disciplinary effort, and to provide
              the necessary infrastructure for a large-scale collaborative design program,
              they plan to create a new entity, the Institute for Design Engineering and
              Applications (IDEA).

IDEA will offer a variety of programs and courses in
              engineering design. These will include a Manufacturing Engineering degree
              program; large-scale, cross-disciplinary courses in new, more advanced area;
              and smaller, more focused offerings, such as courses based on national design
              competitions. It will also actively pursue a research agenda focused on product
              and process  innovation. All research projects will be tied to the
              design
curriculum.
