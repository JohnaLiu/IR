This award will provide funds for the Government University
              Industry Research Roundtable to support activities of the Federal Demonstration
              Partnership (FDP), an ongoing cooperative initiative among university research
              administrators, faculty and federal agency representatives.  FDP, which
              currently consists of representatives from 65 academic institutions and
              approximately 12 federal agencies, offers a forum for members to improve the
              national research enterprise by its efforts to streamline and standardize
              research administration policies and procedures. During the current phase, FDP
              addressed and influenced the research establishment by providing guidance for
              several activities such as: developing data standards and implementing core
              principles for electronic research administration, demonstrating the
              feasibility of electronic data interchange via award documentation, and
              revising grant terms and agreements that correspond with the Office of
              Management and Budget Circulars.  The organization is poised to expand in
              October by nearly 50% as it enters Phase IV of its existence, and will improve
              the relationship between federal agencies and the research community, ensuring
              the efficiency and integrity of STEM administration.
