Abstract    :
              Current mobile emissions estimation systems are typically aimed at predicted
              average emissions for a fleet of vehicles and for a large geographic area. 
              However, on-road, measured vehicle emissions are highly episodic, with
              short-term events of a few seconds in duration producing high emission rates
              and substantially contributing to total trip emissions. Emissions are
              influenced by prevailing traffic control measures (TCMs), transportation
              infrastructure (e.g., roadway design), vehicle characteristics, driver
              behavior, traffic flow, and ambient conditions.  Therefore, there is a critical
              need to develop a rigorous technical basis for predicting emissions for
              individual vehicles taking into account all these key factors.  

The goals
              of this project are to:  (1) evaluate the feasibility of developing micro-scale
              energy and emissions models for individual vehicles, including validation of
              the model under conditions not used in model construction; (2) test a prototype
              IVEEIS that accepts inputs from the vehicle, transportation infrastructure
              (e.g., road grade), and other external sources (e.g., ambient conditions) to
              produce microscale energy and emissions predictions for that particular
              vehicle; and (3) define a path for large-scale implementation of IVEEIS for
              designing and evaluating the effectiveness of various transportation design and
              control measures and for future policy development.  The approach that will be
              used in this project includes the following tasks:  (1) design of on-road field
              experiments; (2) field data collection, for extended periods (e.g., 70 hours of
              second-by-second data) and for several vehicles covering the full range of
              expected variability in energy and emissions; (3) IVEEIS model development
              using engineering and statistical methods; (4) IVEEIS validation and
              application; and (5) specification of IVEEIS application paths to improve
              transportation design, control, and policy, including improved emission
              predictions in current microscopic traffic simulation models.  

The broader
              impact of this research is to enable a deeper and more robust understanding of
              the factors affecting high emissions and energy use episodes in the real world,
              which in turn will provide a strong scientific basis for addressing pressing
              societal issues such as seeking effective air quality and energy use management
              strategies at the driver, network and regional levels.
