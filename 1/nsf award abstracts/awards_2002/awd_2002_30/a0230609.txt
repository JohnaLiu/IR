Abstract

The award will develop
              engineering teaching materials which emphasize design for teachers
in middle
              schools. This builds upon the first stage of a long-term multidisciplinary
              project: the Virginia Middle Schools Engineering Education Initiative (VMSEEI).
               This will infuse selected engineering concepts and procedures into the context
              of preexisting science and mathematics classes.


Engineering schools need
              to develop ways to attract and retain students. Middle
school is when we start
              to lose potential students. In these grades, they make choices that
either
              open or close the doors to advanced science and mathematics. If we start in
              middle
schools, we can make students aware of engineering, and motivate them
              to pursue the
science and mathematics they need to succeed in engineering
              programs.

The interdisciplinary faculty team is in place, as are engineering
              students, education
graduate students and exceptional local science teachers.
              Additional middle school teachers are being recruited from local
              (Charlottesville\Albemarle) and regional (Central Virginia) schools, and
              teachers-in-training at the Curry School of Education at UVa will participate
              in this project.
