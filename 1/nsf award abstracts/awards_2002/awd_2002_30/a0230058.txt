TITLE: Enhancing
              Bioengineering Opportunities for Engineering Majors

Abstract

Michigan
              State University will plan a systemically reform of its undergraduate
              
engineering programs and to enhance undergraduate student learning in the
              field 
of bioengineering. This project will be undertaken by an
              interdisciplinary team composed of faculty from the College of Engineering and
              the College of Education. 

It will address the following factors that affect
              the sustainability of curricular-change initiatives: 
	the role of strategic
              planning within the academic unit and at the institutional level; 
	the
              leadership role of department chairs/heads and college deans; 
	the role of
              faculty planning, faculty assessment and faculty autonomy; 
	the system of
              values and rewards for individual faculty and for their academic units; and
              
	the role of constituent groups in establishing and evaluating educational
              program objectives and                  curricular outcomes. 

Bioengineering
              was selected as the focus for this reform effort because the State of Michigan
              recently announced a $1B.i.e., $50M/year, twenty-year. commitment to developing
              "A Michigan Life Sciences Corridor."
