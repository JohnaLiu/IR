Abstract    :
              There exists a need for educational materials that introduce the research
              paradigm into science courses for nonmajors.  The PIs of this project are
              developing curriculum materials for a course that allows students to model the
              activities of professional scientists as a means of learning scientific method
              and content. These new course materials present student laboratories in the
              format of the scientific professional literature, albeit within a carefully
              defined context.  The information in these papers provides the background
              required to allow the students to design and implement their own experiments.
              

Twelve experiments are being transformed into the scientific
              literature-presentation format.  These are being field tested in general
              science classes and refined based on student response.  A guidebook to provide
              faculty with the tools to carry out similar restructuring of traditional
              laboratory exercises into directed inquiry based laboratories is also being
              prepared.  This guidebook is being evaluated and modified as necessary.  The
              Internet is being used to make the laboratories and guidebook available to
              others.
