This award will partially support a workshop
              entitled "Plastic deformation of minerals and rocks", which is to be held in
              December 4th and 5th of 2002, in Berkeley, California.  The two-day workshop is
              one of the series organized by Mineralogical Society of America.  A total of 13
              invited presentations (16 invited speakers) are currently on the agenda. 
              Reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of this area of science, among these 16
              invited speakers, three are from materials science community and two are from
              geodynamics.

The main purpose of this workshop is to provide students and
              scientists alike an opportunity to learn the current status of plastic
              deformation of minerals and rocks.  There have been major progresses in the
              study of plastic deformation in minerals and rocks during the last 20 years or
              so.  They include the extension of experimental studies to a wider range of
              conditions and the development of theoretical models of deformation including
              the modeling of deformation microstructures.  But there has been little
              opportunity to bring these developments together to allow students and
              scientists in Earth sciences to learn the current progresses to make
              significant advances in Earth sciences.  This workshop will provide such an
              opportunity that is needed for the healthy development of solid Earth sciences
              particularly solid Earth geodynamics.
