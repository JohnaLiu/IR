Abstract    :
              This project develops strategies and pilot programs to increase the number of
              undergraduate students obtaining degrees in science, technology, engineering,
              and mathematics (STEM) fields. The project establishes "On-line Science and
              Engineering Interactive Learning Communities (SEILCs)" to improve retention,
              and to increase student enrollment. SEILCs feature intelligent tutoring systems
              and web-based courses supplemented with on-line live interactions with tutors
              and faculty. SEILCs are open to all students in the College of Engineering, and
              the College of Science and Technology. Using SEILCs, the project develops and
              implements a pilot program with a slow-paced five-year curriculum in Electrical
              and Computer Engineering for students who meet admission standards, but may
              have inadequate backgrounds in mathematics and basic sciences. The five-year
              format makes it possible to deal with their academic needs in a more systematic
              way. The project also provides on-line science and engineering interactive
              learning communities with intelligent tutoring systems for high school level
              science and mathematics courses in coordination with the college of Science and
              Technology. These special learning communities serve a dual purpose. Incoming

              Temple University students in the STEM fields use interactive tutoring to
              review basic mathematics and science concepts. Students from selected high
              schools use them in their college preparation as a service to Temple University
              feeder high schools. The interactions of the high school students with the
              monitors and professors of learning communities increase their interest an
              awareness of the STEM fields of study. The project also establishes
