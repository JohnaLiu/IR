Abstract    :
              Despite extensive research in techniques, protocols and technology, progress in
              providing usable and widely deployed teleconferencing applications has been
              limited.  Commercial products are limited to small groups, or to
              unidirectional, non-interactive, streaming.  Research oriented systems, such as
              the Access Grid, support larger groups and more flexible communication
              patterns, but have very limited support for high quality video formats and are
              fragile due to their reliance on old technology.

The resulting system will
              greatly exceed current implementations in terms of quality, robustness and
              consistent operation; yet it can be developed primarily as an exercise in
              systems integration.  It will facilitate wide area collaborative research and
              information sharing, improve reliability and performance of networked
              conferencing, and forma solid basic for the future development of more advanced
              systems and technologies.

The project will build a video teleconferencing
              tool to enable large-scale, flexible and ad-hoc collaboration. This tool will
              be structured to act as a building block for the development of future
              applications. It will be built on previous work with high quality video and
              robust networked audio, and integrate the results of research into
              teleconferencing systems architecture with modern, high resolution, video
              capture and display devices.
