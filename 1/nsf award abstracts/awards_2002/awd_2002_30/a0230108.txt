Abstract    :
              This Small Business  Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop  a 
              novel nanostructured polymer micelle system for targeted delivery  of
              chemotherapeutic drugs. A star structural  polymer  will  be  synthesized  for 
              use  as  the  drug  delivery  vehicle.  The  star  polymer  will  form
              unimolecular micelles under aqueous conditions. Hydrophobic drugs can be
              encapsulated in the unimolecular micelles and delivered to the cancer tissue
              via an  active targeting process. Functional groups at the micelles surface
              will act as targeting moieties and lead the drug carrier to the desired cancer
              cells. The specific aims in the proposed program  are to synthesize and
              characterize a candidate star polymer, and to conduct in vitro endothelial cell
              adhesive assay to determine the affinity of the star polymer to v3 and v5
              integrins. 

Commercially, with this proposed new drug delivery system, more
              selective delivery by active targeting is possible. This will reduce the drug
              dose and undesirable side effects and make chemotherapy for  cancer treatment
              more efficient. New drug delivery systems have had an impact on nearly every
              branch of medicine. Annual sales in the United States of advanced drug delivery
              systems exceed $10 billion alone and are rising rapidly.
