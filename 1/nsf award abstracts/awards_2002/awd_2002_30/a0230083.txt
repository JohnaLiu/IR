Abstract    :
              The proposed research will address biases in precipitation gauge measurements
              from high latitudes.  Because of low temperatures and precipitation, coupled
              with high winds, bias errors at high latitudes can exceed 100%.  The research
              will build on an extensive experimental base, especially on the World
              Meteorological Organization (WMO) Solid Precipitation Measurement
              Intercomparison Project, to assess the accuracy of precipitation measurements
              and implement consistent bias corrections for arctic regions.  The research
              goal is to develop an unbiased precipitation database and climatology for the
              pan-Arctic.  Results will improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal
              variability in precipitation and its contribution to the freshwater budget of
              the arctic regions.
