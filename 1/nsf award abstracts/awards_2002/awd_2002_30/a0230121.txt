The Geochemical Earth Reference Model (GERM)
              Initiative is a grass-roots effort to define the earth as one chemical and
              physical model system.  On its path towards this goal, GERM holds workshops
              that define a scientific vision for an earth reference model and identify
              critical technical advances that are needed to move towards a GERM.  GERM has
              addressed important problems in data publication, and it created a website with
              several databases that support global geochemical research.  GERM workshops
              offer a bi-annual review of the earth as a chemical system, defining a
              state-of-the-art vision for GERM activities, and a forum for directing
              technical and scientific efforts most needed to advance a reference model of
              the earth. 

We propose here to expand the contents of GERM on line databases
              and we request funds for making the GERM website and database more convenient
              to use and better searchable.  These efforts will make GERM into a much-used
              facility for geochemical research. Much of our development work will be focused
              on enabling community participation, through the development of a data
              population protocol and upload capabilities.  This will eventually make GERM
              into a resource that is maximally self-sustaining with minimal (and therefore
              cost effective) help by a permanent database staff. Following our tradition of
              combining database activity with scientifically motivated workshops, we will
              hold a fourth GERM workshop in May 2003 in Lyon, France.  We will be
              responsible for all non-local meeting organization, and contribute to
              participant costs for US scientists and graduate students.
