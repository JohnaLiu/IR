TITLE: Relevancy Enhancement Achieved by
              Laboratories and Lecture Integrated for Engineering Education (REAL LIFE)
              Adoption of a Relevant Undergraduate Curriculum
Abstract

There is a
              critical need for engineering education at reform at Oklahoma State University
              (OSU) due to an unacceptably  low retention of students, particularly women and
              under-represented minorities, in the engineering program . The thesis of this
              proposal is that the root cause of low retention is that students do not
              perceive engineering courses as relevant to their lives.  

Oklahoma State
              University proposes  a one-year curriculum reform effort  designed to bring 
              relevancy  to  the  engineering curriculum.  The proposed reform effort is
              based on proven pedagogical models for which local expertise exists.  Planning,
              implementation, and assessment are addressed.  Both short-term and long-term
              goals are clearly defined.
