Abstract

The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga is designing a
              coordinated, comprehensive
program to increase the number of students entering
              engineering fields in the targeted
Tennessee/Georgia area. By including and
              impacting both pre-service and in-service
teachers at grades K-12, this
              program, Bridges to Engineering Science: Teaching
Teachers (B.E.S.T.T.), has
              the potential to affect the over 115,000 students in grades K-
12 in thirteen
              school systems in Tennessee and Georgia identified as potential partners.
The
              program will include a partnership between the Colleges of Engineering
              and
Education; interaction among faculty and students of the colleges and the
              thirteen
targeted school systems; development of high quality, self contained,
              apparatus based
engineering science experiments and curriculum units which
              meet the education system
goals and educational standards; development and
              dissemination of teaching materials on
hands-on, age appropriate, engaging
              engineering science units for grades K-12; special
targeted inclusion of
              groups currently under-represented in engineering; and formative
and summative
              assessment at all stages of the project.
