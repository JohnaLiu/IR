Abstract    :
              Professor Gabriel Lopez of the University of New Mexico is funded by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to develop a fluorescence detection
              method for biosensor arrays based on excited state lifetimes.  The method,
              based on phase information about the emitted light, would have the advantages
              of fluorescence in terms of sensitivity with greater selectivity than just
              wavelength characteristics alone.  The closed loop auto-oscillating system
              developed in the PI's lab will be improved for stability and reliability and
              will be built into a sensor platform.  Students will learn biosensing, optics
              and instrumentation.  The work in this Small Grant for Exploratory Research
              will also have impact in spectroanalysis in general.

One approach to sensing
              trace biological agents is to detect light emitted from a molecular tag on the
              agents.  The development of sensitive detectors that are rugged, reliable and
              inexpensive would have impact on our ability to sense and identify biological
              agents.  This research has national security implications as well as potential
              medical and environmental applications.
