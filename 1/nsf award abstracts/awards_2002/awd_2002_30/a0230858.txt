DIMACS, the Center
              for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science, will
run a workshop
              entitled Computational Geometry and Computer-Aided Design and
              Manufacturing.
The purpose of this workshop is to promote the interaction
              between Computational
Geometry and Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing by
              bringing together,
in a single forum, researchers from both of these .elds to
              assess the current state of work
at the interface of the two fields, to
              identify research needs, and to establish directions for
collaborative future
              work. Topics to be addressed include geometric aspects (modeling
              and
representation techniques, data structures, algorithms and analysis,
              software development,
implementation and testing, etc.) of: manufacturing
              processes, manufacturing and assembly
planning, rapid prototyping
              technologies, model acquisition/reconstruction, reverse
              engineering,
computational metrology and tolerancing, mechanism design,
              constraint systems,
simulation and visualization in design and manufacturing,
              solid modeling related to manufacturing,
computer vision and robotics related
              to manufacturing, and manufacturing in
specific applications (e.g.,
              biomedical, textile, automotive, aerospace engineering etc.).
