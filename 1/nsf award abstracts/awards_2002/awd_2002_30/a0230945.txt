Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the phenomenon of broadband electrostatic noise
              (BEN) that has been observed in the Earth's magnetotail.  The project will
              examine a recent model for the production of BEN which involves both trapped
              solitary waves and an untrapped, large region of non-solitary waves.  It will
              focus on developing two aspects of the model: (1) the non-linear theory of
              trapped solitary waves in a general magnetized plasma, and (2) the evolution of
              non-solitary waves associated with beam-plasma instabilities in inhomogeneous
              plasmas.
