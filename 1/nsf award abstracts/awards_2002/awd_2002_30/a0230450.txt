This project, entitled "Accelerating globally Distributed Team
              Innovation: Building an Experimental Testbed to Leverage Digital Libraries in
              the Transformation of Design Engineering Education" is a collaborative effort
              of Stanford University and Strathclyde University, Scotland.  The project also
              informally engages partners at other institutions.  The project proposes the
              development, implementation and use of a testbed to improve the teaching and
              learning of students participating in global team based design projects. The
              project aims to fundamentally change the way design engineering is taught by
              combining the use of digital libraries with virtual design studios. The goal of
              the project is to enhance student learning opportunities by enabling them to
              partake in global, team based design engineering projects, in which they
              directly experience different cultural contexts and access a variety of digital
              information sources via a range of appropriate technology.
