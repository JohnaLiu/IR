ABSTRACT

The purpose of this proposed project is
              to establish and institutionalize a Bridging 
Engineering and Education in
              Central Florida (BEEF) Committee to develop a comprehensive strategic plan. 
              The strategic plan will be designed to increase the numbers and diversity of
              students entering as STEM majors and enhance the learning and the academic
              success of these students.  Collaborators in the development of this strategic
              plan will include: the UCF Colleges of Engineering and Education, the 11 area
              schools districts, the Florida Virtual School, and the six area community
              colleges.  Central Florida has over 485,000 K-12 students, over 73,000
              community college students and over 35,000 state university students
              (approximately 8,600 UCF students are engineering and education majors).  This
              project will have a powerful impact on bridging engineering and education to
              many of the diverse students in the Central Florida area.  

Goal: Enhance
              and institutionalize collaboration among the College of Education, College of
              Engineering, the six area community colleges, the Florida Virtual School, and
              11 area school districts by establishing a joint BEEF Committee co-chaired by
              the Deans of each College. 
Objective 1: Discussion and evaluation of
              university curriculum issues including course 
revisions in the introductory
              engineering courses and teacher preparation education 
courses, program
              changes, and accreditation issues.  
Objective 2: Renew and expand existing
              outreach programs with pubic schools and 
educational agencies by creating
              joint partnerships involving both Colleges. 
Objective 3: Articulation with
              community colleges concerning the two introductory 
engineering courses, EGN
              1006 and EGN 1007. 

Although this project is specifically designed to serve
              the Florida population, the courses, and strategies may be used anywhere.
