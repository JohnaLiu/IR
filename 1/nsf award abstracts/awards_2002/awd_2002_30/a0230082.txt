Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this project is to determine the exchange of water masses
              between the open ocean and the continental shelf along the western side of the
              Antarctic Peninsula.  The proposed analyses will make use of existing acoustic
              doppler current profile (ADCP) data collected on board antarctic oceanographic
              research vessels in the context of the Southern Ocean experiment of the Global
              Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics Study.  The data will be examined for consistency with
              other analyzed velocity fields, and will be complemented by an analysis of the
              output from a regional model of shelf-edge velocities and density fields (the
              Rutgers/UCLA Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS)).  The  high horizontal
              resolution of ADCP velocity fields, combined with recent advances in regional
              oceanic modeling provides new opportunities to: (1) determine the mean outer
              shelf and shelf-edge circulation at horizontal scales that were previously
              unresolved; (2) investigate variability of circulation with wind, buoyancy, and
              boundary current forcing, and with alongshelf bathymetric variability; (3)
              examine across-slope transport mechanisms and pathways; and (4) analyze the
              dynamics of dominant processes at the shelf-edge.
Recent research has
              indicated that the open ocean may act as a significant source of nutrients,
              heat, and salt for antarctic continental shelves.  Therefore, processes at the
              shelf-edge can significantly affect water mass modification, sea ice cycling,
              and cross-shelf exchanges of
nutrients and other biogenic material on the
              shelf.
