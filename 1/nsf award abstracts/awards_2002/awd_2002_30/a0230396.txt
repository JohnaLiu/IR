Polar ice cores provide critical insights to societally
              relevant issues and ice core results underpin much of global change research.
              The Ice Core Working Group (which, under the coordination of the National  Ice
              Core Laboratory Science Management Office, provides guidance to the National
              Science Foundation and the United States Geological Survey on issues pertaining
              to ice cores) has recommended a community-wide ice-coring program in West
              Antarctica at a location referred to as the Inland Site.  A deep ice core from
              there will enable studies of climate and sea-level change and life in extreme
              environments, and will help educate many new Earth-system scientists.  This
              project is for the design, construction and testing of a deep-ice-coring drill,
              and for other preparations required to recover a deep ice core from the Inland
              Site.
