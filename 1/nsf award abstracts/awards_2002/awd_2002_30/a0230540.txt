Abstract    :
              The National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs (NSF/OPP) sponsors
              and supports scientific research in polar regions ,where some sponsored
              projects involve underwater diving.  The OPP Health and Safety Officer within
              OPP's Polar Research Support Section is responsible for developing and
              implementing a diving safety program addressing scientific diving activities in
              polar regions.  The existing OPP diving safety program is patterned after the
              American Academy of Underwater Sciences (AAUS) Standards for Scientific Diving.
               In order to augment in-house experience, OPP has entered into a Memorandum of
              Agreement (MOA) with the Smithsonian Institution, another government agency
              with expertise in conducting and managing scientific diving operations
              throughout the country.  This MOA allows the NSF to utilize the knowledge,
              skills, and experience of the Smithsonian Institution's Diving Safety Officer
              in assisting OPP in managing its scientific diving operations in polar regions.
               This MOA mechanism provides a cost-effective mechanism for OPP to obtain
              scientific diving safety expertise on an as-needed basis.

The MOA was
              initiated in November, 2001, with the understanding that each year in the late
              Spring a mutually agreed-upon annual tasking statement would be developed and
              appropriate funds set aside to support the initiative for the subsequent
              twelve-month period.  Each year that annual tasking statement could be modified
              to reflect current needs at the time, so long as the requested activities were
              consistent scope of work defined in the MOA.
