Abstract    :
              The proposed research addresses the question "How will the coupled arctic
              climate system respond to changes in riverine discharge of freshwater, and how
              to the temporal and spatial variability of freshwater discharge and changes
              therein interact with the dynamics of high latitude climate?".  The project
              proposes to perform a series of numerical simulations using existing models
              that incorporate sea ice, atmosphere and ocean processes.  Science questions
              will be posed through model runs in which sea ice, ocean, and land surface
              models are run off-line, and aspects of the off-line climatologies will be
              prescribed in partially coupled runs of the fully coupled system.  The results
              of the partially coupled runs will be compared with results of fully coupled,
              ensemble climate simulations in order to isolate the effects of interactions
              among the land, sea ice, ocean and atmosphere.
