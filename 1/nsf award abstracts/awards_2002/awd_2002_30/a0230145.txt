This is a study of high field strength element
              (HFSE; Ti, Ta, Nb, Zr, Hf) and Lu-Hf isotopic systematics in volcanic rocks of
              the Aleutian island arc. The main objective of the study is to constrain the
              details of HFSE and related rare-earth element behavior in subduction zones.
              Specifically, the study will evaluate the conditions under-which HFSE behave
              conservatively versus non-conservatively during subduction magma genesis. High
              field strength element abundances and Hf-Nd isotopes will be measured in lavas
              collected from along the full length of the oceanic Aleutian arc. The
              analytical approach will involve (1) dissolution of samples in steel-jacketed
              Teflon vessels; (2) spiking of samples with a mixed 94Zr, 176Lu, 180Hf, 180Ta
              spike; (3) separation of elements of interest with ion-exchange chemistry; and
              (4) analysis of samples by isotope dilution on a multi-collector ICP mass
              spectrometer. This study will document along-arc and cross-arc changes in
              Aleutian HFSE and Hf isotope geochemistry. Well-documented changes in physical
              conditions along the arc, in particular the inferred relative temperature of
              the subducting plate and mantle wedge in the eastern versus western Aleutians,
              and the presence or absence of subducted sediment in the mantle source beneath
              different parts of the arc, will provide the geologic context for interpreting
              the observed HFSE and Hf isotopic variation.
