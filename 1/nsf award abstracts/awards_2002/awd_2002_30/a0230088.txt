TITLE: Striking a Balance between Engineering
              Science and Engineering Design: Development of an Engineering Systems and
              Design Program

Abstract

The  goal of this project is to develop an
              undergraduate engineering curriculum that prepares students to work as design
              engineers at the boundaries of two or more traditional engineering disciplines.
              The proposed interdisciplinary program, focusing on engineering systems and
              engineering design, encompasses the study of theories and methodologies that
              develop creative solutions to open-ended engineering design problems. Graduates
              of this program, called Engineering Systems and Design, will use modern design
              methodologies,
simulation, analysis and optimization techniques to develop
              safe and functional solutions to complex interdisciplinary design problems
              while adhering to constraints involving economics, reliability, durability,
              aesthetics, ethics and social impact (including legal and environmental
              issues).

The increased flexibility incorporated in the Engineering System
              Design program will appeal to a large number of bright students who are not
              interested in
traditional engineering programs with rigid requirements. The
              program will also meet increasing industry demands for broad-based product and
              systems designers capable of immediately working in interdisciplinary
              engineering areas such as mechatronics, nanosystems and bioengineering.
