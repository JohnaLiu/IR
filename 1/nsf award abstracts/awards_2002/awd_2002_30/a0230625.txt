ABSTRACT

Building an Engineering and Education
              Partnership
Smith College Proposal  to Bridges for Engineering Education,
              
NSF-02-092
 
The Smith College Picker Engineering Program, Department of
              Education and Child Study, and Office of Educational Outreach propose to build
              upon an innovative partnership they have already established to enhance the
              quality and expand the reach of engineering education preK-16.  The first goal
              is to integrate engineering into the Smith Department of Education and Child
              Study program by a) developing a certification program in
              technology/engineering, and b) designing a certificate program for elementary
              school engineering education.  The second goal is to develop best educational
              practices in the Picker Engineering Program by expanding the role of an expert
              educator in the curriculum development process.  The third goal is to enhance
              engineering educational outreach at Smith College by developing engineering
              education teacher resources and by expanding the engineering education course
              for teachers.  These goals respond to national calls for science education
              reform (preK-12) and for the integrating engineering education into the preK-12
              curriculum; to the call for engineering education reform at the college and
              university level; and, to the grave need to recruit and retain women and
              underrepresented minorities in science, engineering, and technology fields in
              our nation's workforce.
