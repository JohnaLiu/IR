This three-year award for US-France cooperative research
              involves researchers and students at the University of Illinois and University
              of Grenoble.  Richard L. Weaver in the US and Bart A. Van Tiggelen in France
              lead this cooperative project on the mesoscopics of elastic and seismic waves. 
              They will investigate diffuse elastic waves in randomly disordered open
              structures.  The objective is to explore the applicability of modern concepts
              in mesoscopic wave phenomena to seismic waves in the earth's crust.   The
              project involves laboratory and/or field and/or theoretical aspects.  Students
              will be trained in ultrasonic techniques and seismic measurements.  The US
              investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in mesoscopic issues, work
              on diffusion and incoherent transport of ultrasound.  This is complemented by
              French expertise in optical waves, and waves in random media.  

This award
              represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF, and the French
              National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).   NSF will cover travel funds
              and living expenses for the US investigator and graduate students.  CNRS will
              support visits by French investigators and graduate students to the United
              States.
