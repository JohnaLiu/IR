Abstract    :
              Most Rodinia plate reconstructions propose juxtaposition of the western Amazon
              craton with some segment of the 3000 km long Grenville margin of Laurentia.
              This connection is based on linking similarly aged (ca. 1.2-0.95 Ga) mobile
              belts across ancient continental margins. However, poor understanding of the
              metamorphic and structural history of the western Amazon block has prevented a
              test of these Laurentia-Amazonia configurations.  This proposal requests
              funding for exploratory work in recently exposed field areas to document the
              deformational history of the western Amazon craton using structural mapping,
              metamorphic petrology and geochronology. Preliminary mapping and sample
              collecting of two
key regions in the western Brazilian state of Rondonia,
              located on the margin of the Amazon craton, will be undertaken in collaboration
              with the Brazilian Geological Service (CPRM). The laboratory portion of this
              project will focus on pressure and temperature (P-T) conditions and
              geochronology (using 40Ar/39Ar and U/Pb systems) for the timing of peak
              metamorphism and deformation. These data will test the feasibility of a larger
              project in the area toward a firm understanding of Laurentia-Amazonia
              interactions in late
Proterozoic times.
