TITLE: Exposing Secondary Teachers to Engineering
              Design By Developing Virtual Laboratories


ABSTRACT

The engineering
              approach to design is rarely included in high school courses partially
because
              teachers lack a thorough understanding of design and the approach to design.
              A
goal of this project is to have high school educators  learn and practice 
              the
fundamentals of engineering design using a subject with which they have
              some expertise
as a starting point. These pre-service science teachers will
              design and construct, with the
help of an engineering professional, an
              interactive Internet based Virtual Laboratory to be
used in a high school
              physics course. The resulting software will then be tested and used in a high
              school setting. This approach allows the pre-service scholars to share their
              educational expertise while dealing with the technical aspects of web-site
              design and simulation of scientific
phenomenon. Much research has proven that
              experts approach problems differently than
novices.  This project will teach
              pre-service science students the fundamentals of engineering
design by
              presenting them a realistic design problem, and the experience of setting up of
              a instructional web- site about it.
