Abstract    :
              Viscous conservation laws arise in a wide variety of physical 
applications,
              including fluid dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics,
and materials science.  Of
              particular importance are solutions
of such equations that are stable and
              hence typically 
correspond with observable phenomena.  Unfortunately,
              establishing
the stability of these solutions has proven to be a
              quite
difficult problem.  The pointwise Green's function approach,
however,
              initiated by Liu and developed by Liu and his 
collaborators, has proven quite
              robust: in applications to 
viscous shock waves arising in single conservation
              laws of
arbitrary order, viscous shock waves arising in systems 
with second
              order diffusion, planar viscous shock waves, 
degenerate viscous shock waves,
              and rarefaction waves.  
We propose to continue and extend this promising line
              of
research in three directions.  First, new techniques 
recently developed
              by Howard and Zumbrun appear suitable
for extension to (i) systems of viscous
              conservation 
laws admitting degenerate viscous shock waves, and (ii)
systems
              of viscous conservation laws with high order
viscosity.  Second, we propose to
              develop further 
techniques that will extend the pointwise Green's 
function
              approach to the case of viscous rarefaction 
waves.  Finally, we would like to
              incorporate new techniques
recently developed in the context of perturbation
              theory
for completely integrable systems into the study of 
the necessarily
              oscillatory dynamics that arise in 
viscous conservation laws of order higher
              than two.


The conservation of such fundamental properties as energy
              and
momentum often leads to partial differential equations
that model some
              underlying physical process.  For example,
the Navier-Stokes equations of
              fluid dynamics and 
the Maxwell equations of electromagnetism follow this
              
paradigm.  Of primary concern are stable phenomena: those
whose principal
              structure is robust to minor environmental
fluctuations.  We propose to
              continue and extend a 
promising line of research that has been
              extraordinarily 
successful in establishing a clear criterion for
              such
stability.  A direct consequence of the approach is a 
detailed
              understanding of certain fundamental partial
differential equations.
