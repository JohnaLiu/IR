Abstract    :
              
This proposal will advance the state-of-the art of evaluation by applying
              theory-based evaluation in STEM education.  The grant will design and refine a
              theoretical framework for an innovative evaluation design of STEM education
              programs and provide meta-analyses of how different approaches in teacher
              professional development affect teaching practices and student learning.
