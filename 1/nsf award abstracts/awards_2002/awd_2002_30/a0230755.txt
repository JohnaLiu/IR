Abstract    :
              This project is developing two sets of interactive examples and tools to assist
              in the teaching and learning of mathematical proof techniques. While the
              primary target audience is pre-service teachers at the secondary level and
              elementary teachers with a concentration in mathematics, the tools are also
              being piloted in an upper division abstract algebra course. Both the
              CounterExamples package and the ProofReader package are being designed to
              facilitate extensibility in that other faculty can add problems to both. The
              Mathematics Digital Library (www.mathdl.org) is serving as a primary
              repository. In addition, discussions with a publisher are underway for the
              examples and tools to complement an existing discrete mathematics textbook.
