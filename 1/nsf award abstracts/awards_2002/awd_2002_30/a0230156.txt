Abstract    :
              North Carolina State University (NCSU) and North Carolina Agricultural and
              Technical
State University (NC A&T) are collaborating in developing a program
              designed to
increase the number of graduates in science, technology,
              engineering and mathematics
(STEM). Specific program elements include a summer
              camp at NCSU for graduating
high school students who have not selected their
              majors, summer bridge programs at both
NCSU and NC A&T designed to prepare new
              STEM students for introductory college
science and math courses, undergraduate
              research programs at both schools, tutoring and
mentoring of STEM majors and a
              faculty exchange program between the two campuses.
A comprehensive monitoring
              program is included to track all students in the program and
to provide the
              data required to evaluate each program element. Success in the program
will
              result in an increase in the number of STEM graduates, through both an increase
              in
the number of entering majors and an increase in retention.
