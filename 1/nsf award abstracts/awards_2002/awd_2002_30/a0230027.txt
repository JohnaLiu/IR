Abstract
End-member possibilities for stable
              lithospheric extension will be tested according to
their influence on physical
              properties of the deep crust and upper mantle across the Great
Basin-Colorado
              Plateau transition zone, south-central Utah. The main geophysical
property to
              be investigated is electrical conductivity, together with its implications
              for
thermal and rheological state, which will be imaged using the
              magnetotelluric (MT)
technique. New MT surveying primarily across the
              transition zone (TZ) per se will join
existing data into an E-W transect
              nearly 400 km in length, with a depth range of
sensitivity from 100's of m to
              250-400 km approximately. Data will be acquired using
wideband and long-period
              recorders of the University of Utah and University of
Washington, which reside
              in the NSF-supported EMSOC instrument facility. Existing
geophysical
              indicators show a strong N-S strike orientation at upper crustal
              to
lithospheric scales and should allow accurate cross sections of model
              conductivity using
mainly current 2-D regularized inversion platforms.
              Substantially reduced electrical
resistivity values at lower crustal and upper
              mantle depths inferred from MT field
data most likely reflect melts and
              exsolved ionic fluids. Previous surveying indicates
that the onset of low
              resistivity in the deep crust occurs for T > ~500-550 o C in
              high-grade
metaigneous host rocks. Depth variation in low resistivity thus
              will approximate
an isotherm which should evolve gradually from the GB to the
              CP in the case of
uniform TZ warming, or show an upwelling under the
              little-extended TZ in the case
of non-uniform, enhanced extension at depth.
              Exsolved fluids weaken the lithosphere
greatly through diffusion creep, so
              resistivity will provide a clear view of at least
relative rheological
              contrasts. Conductivity, heat flow and constraints on composition
and timing
              of extension, will be used in time-dependent, 2-D thermal modeling for
              an
improved projection of the thermal field into the upper mantle.
