This award supports the PI and graduate students from Stanford
              University in a collaboration with Juergen Wolfrum of the Institute for Physics
              and Chemistry at the University of Heidelberg, Germany.  The combined efforts
              of the German and US groups will focus on two problems susceptible to their
              complementary expertise.  One is the development of quantitative laser-induced
              fluorescence measurements of nitric oxide at high pressures where pressure
              broadening produces interference from molecular oxygen.  The other is to extend
              to high pressure the characterization of molecular fuel tracers for imaging of
              the fuel/air mixing.  The German and US groups have chosen molecular tracers
              with different chemical structure, and the collaborative research will
              facilitate direct comparison of the two different methods.  During the first
              year and a half of this project, significant work was completed on both
              problems.  The third year will build on this excellent track record and bring
              the work on nitric oxide and the fuel tracers towards closure.

The project
              also has an educational objective.  The project will allow the graduate
              students involved to benefit from performing research in another country.  They
              will develop a heightened appreciation of the world around them while also
              learning important new technical skills.
