TITLE: Development of an IT intensive Manufacturing
              Engineering Curriculum

ABSTRACT
 
With the phenomenal explosion of
              e-businesses and the continuing adoption of the 
Virtual Enterprise  (VE)
              model in manufacturing, there is a substantial interest in 
American industry
              in the availability of engineering students who possesses skills to 
succeed
              in this new  Information Technology (IT) intensive manufacturing work
              
environment.  In this context, there is a need for our educational
              institutions to develop 
innovative curriculum, which will enable our students
              to .hit the ground running. when 
they begin working in their respective
              organizations upon graduation.  Our manufacturing 
industry needs a new type
              of engineer, who must not only possess a strong background in 
manufacturing 
              (and  manufacturing  systems)  but  also  be  skilled  at  using  emerging
              
technologies such as Virtual Reality, the  Internet and other tools to
              accomplish a wide 
range  of  activities  in  the  context  of  virtual 
              manufacturing  enterprises.    
 
This project will develop comprehensive
              plans for the design and development of a new manufacturing engineering
              curriculum, which addresses the changing manufacturing landscape.  Such an
              information technology based manufacturing  curriculum will benefit graduating
              students and industrial organizations (who hire them) by providing a workforce,
              which possesses skills and knowledge that are necessary to succeed in today's
              evolving  global economy.  Other  activities proposed include the incorporation
              of virtual reality technology to enhance student learning for under-represented
              minorities including students with physical challenges.  The project team
              includes New Mexico State university and other academic and industry partners.
