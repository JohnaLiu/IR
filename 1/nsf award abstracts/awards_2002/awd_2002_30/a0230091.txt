This work will study arc magmatism and hydrothermal
              activity in a 75x30x10 km block of the upper crust in central Arizona. The area
              has exceptional 3-D exposure due to the topographic relief, arid climate, and
              extensional fault rotation. This area presents an exceptional opportunity to
              study shallow (<10 km) magmatic systems, and address near versus far-field
              controls on mineralization, hydrothermal systems, and styles of magmatic
              evolution. We hope to develop a picture of the evolution of large magmatic
              centers in arc settings. The work will focus on geologic mapping, structural
              reconstruction, geochronology, and petrology of contrasting Laramide centers in
              the Tortilla and Dripping Spring Mountains. This area encompasses the Ray,
              Globe-Miami, and Superior mining districts. Mapping will resolve the
              distribution, timing, and character of igneous, metamorphic, and hydrothermal
              features. Using these results, pre-extension geometries will be reconstructed
              and linked to industry and USGS studies. Magmatic and hydrothermal events will
              be constrained with U-Pb, Ar-Ar, and Re-Os dating and whole rock, mineral,
              isotope and fluid inclusion studies. Broader impacts include education of
              post-doctoral, graduate and undergraduate students, collaborations with the
              USGS and the mining industry, and improved exploration models for porphyry
              copper and related ore deposits.
