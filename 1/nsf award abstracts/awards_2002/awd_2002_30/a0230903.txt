Abstract    :
              The project will investigate the dynamical mechanisms maintaining tropopause
              height and its permeability in the extratropical latitudes. Understanding the
              formation, maintenance, and kinematics of the midlatitude tropopause remains a
              core, challenging problem in dynamic meteorology. Recent interest in its
              dynamic permeability stems from its considerable impact on transport of
              chemical constituents, including ozone and water vapor, between the troposphere
              and stratosphere. Dr. Nakamura (U of Chicago) will investigate the problem both
              theoretically and numerically. Numerical calculations with quasi-geostrophic
              and general circulation models will expand the theoretical analysis of the
              advection-diffusion equation to more realistic scenarios, including one
              involving penetration of the tropopause by the eddy potential vorticity fluxes.
              The project will advance theoretical understanding of the dynamical interaction
              of the troposphere and stratosphere, and should provide separate estimates of
              the stratosphere-to-troposphere, and troposphere-to-stratosphere mass
              transfers, which will improve modeling and prediction of cross-tropopause
              transports of trace gases and substances.
