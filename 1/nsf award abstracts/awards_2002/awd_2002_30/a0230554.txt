TITLE: Developing a
              Research-Based Undergraduate Experience Focused on Systems Thinking,
              Information Technology and Laboratory Applications

Abstract

The  goal of
              this planning grant is to develop a comprehensive plan and strategy to
              reformulate the undergraduate experience within the Department of Civil &
              Environmental Engineering at the University of Vermont to allow its graduates
              to meet the engineering and
technological challenges of the future. It is
              important to change the way students are educated to better develop their
              creativity, promote their critical thinking, enhance their knowledge discovery
              skills and promote life-long learning and teaching. The vision for achieving
              this presented in this proposal is to develop a research-based educational
              experience for students throughout their undergraduate tenure. This experience
              will focus on: (1) systems thinking, and an appreciation of the societal and
              environmental impacts of engineered systems; (2) Information Technology
(IT)
              applications and computational modeling; and (3) experience in the design,
              conduct and analysis of hands-on laboratory experiments.
