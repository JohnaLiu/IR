TITLE: Developing a Modern Mechanical
              Engineering Curriculum

ABSTRACT

Computation is now regarded as an equal
              and indispensable partner with theory, synthesis, experimentation and product
              realization in the engineering workplace as well as in the advance of
              cutting-edge research. While computers have begun to play a role in engineering
              education, their effective use is far behind their potential. In this proposal
              we seek to use computational tools to improve the capacity of our graduates to
              design, analyze and realize complex physical systems, while retaining the
              strength of the program in
the engineering sciences. Indeed, we believe that
              through appropriate utilization of computation throughout the curriculum,
              students can graduate with a richer understanding of the fundamental concepts
              of the field than is possible now. We intend to use computation as a bridge
              across the traditional divide between theory and application with a view to the
              future. Working with our industry partners, disciplinary professional
              societies, and the National Academy of Engineering's Engineer 2020 initiative,
              we will consider the impact
of new emerging disciplines, transformational
              changes in industrial practice and projected societal needs into our curricular
              reform efforts.
