TITLE: The Global Engineering College:
              Integrating International Training into Engineering
              Education

Abstract

The most significant development in modern engineering
              over the last decade has been the increasing globalization of corporate
              economies. Today's engineering graduates are regularly asked to collaborate
              with colleagues of diverse backgrounds and who are working at sites or with
              affiliate companies around the world. Specifically, modern engineering practice
              requires competence in novel collaboration and communication skills in addition
              to the technical skills taught in traditional engineering curricula. These
              skills include, for example, collaborative teaming and team management skills,
              cross-cultural communication skills and the ability to perform on
              geographically distributed teams. This project will undertake plans to infuse
              the engineering curriculum with opportunities for international
              experiences.
