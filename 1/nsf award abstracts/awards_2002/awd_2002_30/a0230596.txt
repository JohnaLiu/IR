QEM

Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network, a
              non-profit organization, has been instrumental in improving the education of
              under-represented groups that have been historically undeserved by the nation's
              educational system.  A successor to the Quality Education for Minorities
              Project based at MIT, QEM continues to develop effective strategies of STEM
              education for minorities, and focuses on issues and barriers that prevent
              minorities for receiving a high quality education.  

This award to QEM will
              provide technical assistance to junior faculty at minority-serving institutions
              and eligible underrepresented minority faculty at other institutions to enable
              them to participate more successfully in the NSF's Faculty Early Career
              Development (CAREER) Program.  Minority faculty play a significant role in the
              production of minority baccalaureate degree recipients in STEM disciplines as
              well as in the disproportionate production of minority college graduates who
              pursue graduate degrees. Consequently there will be the broadening of
              participation and enhanced diversity within the Foundation's programs as it
              relates to the strategic goal of People, Tools, and Ideas.
