Abstract    :
              Educational institutions, particularly those without access to clean room
              facilities, find
it difficult to offer a course that exposes students to the
              concepts of MEMS micro fabrication and MEMS-based devices. This project is
              developing educational materials that provide students with MEMS devices for
              characterization and study, and instructors with easy-to-use course and
              training materials. This full-scale development is based on a prototype course
              offered during Spring 2001 and 2002 at NJIT and Columbia
University.
              Specifically, the product is a laboratory kit for hands-on MEMS exploration
              that includes 1) a polished set of experiments built upon the existing
              prototype activities, 2) a set of MEMS devices for testing, and wafers to
              illustrate key process steps, 3) easy- to-use device packaging or mounting
              hardware, 4) a supplemental process and device illustration/simulation software
              tool to further illustrate design and processing, 5) teacher training and
              lecture materials and exemplary reports, and 6) recommended equipment and
              software platforms for each device type. Including actual MEMS devices in the
              kit is perhaps the most novel aspect of the proposed program, but necessary if
              hands-on MEMS is to be accessible to a wide audience. The product is being beta
              tested at six partner universities, including small schools with small
              programs, to help insure appropriateness for national dissemination.
              Furthermore,  a commercialization partner has been identified and has agreed to
              help develop a product that can be distributed nationally through their network
              of major dealers.
