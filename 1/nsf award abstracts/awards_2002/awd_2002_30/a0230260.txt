Abstract    :
              High latitude deep ice cores contain fundamental records of polar temperatures,
              atmospheric dust loads (and continental aridity), greenhouse gas
              concentrations, the status of the biosphere, and other essential properties of
              past environments. An accurate chronology for these records is needed if their
              significance is to be fully realized. The dating challenge has stimulated
              efforts at orbital tuning. In this approach, one varies a timescale, within
              allowable limits, to optimize the match between a paleoenvironmental property
              and a curve of insolation through time. The ideal property would vary with time
              due to direct insolation forcing. It would be unaffected by complex climate
              feedbacks and teleconnections, and it would give a clean record with high
              signal/noise ratio. It is argued strongly that the O2/N2 ratio of ice core
              trapped gases is such a property, and evidence is presented that this property,
              whose atmospheric ratio is nearly constant, is tied to local summertime
              insolation.  This award will support a project to  analyze the O2/N2 ratios at
              1 kyr intervals from ~ 115-400 ka in the Vostok ice core. Ancillary
              measurements will be made of Ar/N2, and Ne/N2 and heavy noble gas ratios, in
              order to understand bubble close-off fractionation and its manifestation in the
              Vostok trapped gas record.  O2/N2 variations will be matched with summertime
              insolation at Vostok to achieve a high-accuracy chronology for the Vostok core.
               The Vostok and other correlatable climate records will then be reexamined to
              improve our understanding of the dynamics of Pleistocene climate change.
