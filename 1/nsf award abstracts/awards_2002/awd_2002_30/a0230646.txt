Abstract

The project will
              reformulate the biomedical engineering undergraduate curriculum at Yale by
              emphasizing a) faculty involvement with students at all levels throughout the 4
              year B.S. program; b) integration of presentation of knowledge through
              laboratory, lecture, and electronic media; and c) definition of selected areas
              of emphasis that represent strengths of the Yale research faculty and areas of
              industrial importance. We propose a core curriculum that presents the core
              science of BME as well as specialized tracks that provide advanced training in
              our areas of emphasis: biomedical imaging, biomechanics, and biomolecular
              engineering. We will implement this proposal in two phases. During the 12-month
              planning phase, we will offer two new courses (one each at the freshman and
              senior-levels) and implement new junior-level laboratory modules that
              incorporate concepts from molecular and cellular biology. We will also explore
              new concepts and develop a coordinated plan for the second phase, beyond the
              12-month planning period, which will include reformulation of the core BME
              courses and the addition of new advanced level electives in our areas of
              emphasis.
