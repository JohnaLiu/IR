Abstract    :
              The summit crater of Mt. Moulton, in West Antarctica, contains a 600-m thick
              horizontally-exposed section of ice with intercalated tephra layers from nearby
              Mt Berlin. Argon-40/Argon-39 dating of the thick, near-source tephra indicates
              that the age of the horizontal ice section ranges between 15,000 and 492,000
              years. Thus, the Mt Moulton site offers an unparalleled repository of ancient
              West Antarctic snow and trapped air that can be used to investigate West
              Antarctic climate over much of the past 500,000 years. The planar nature and
              consistent dips of the tephra layers suggests that, although the ice section
              has thinned, it is otherwise undeformed. The Mt. Moulton site was visited
              during the 1999/2000 field season, at which time a horizontal ice core
              representing approximately 400 meters of ice was collected, ranging in age from
              15,000 to older than 480,000 years. In addition to this horizontal core,
              samples of ice at a range of depths were collected in order to test the quality
              of the climate record in the ice. Forty  tephra layers intercalated in the ice
              were also collected in order to provide chronology for the ice section. The
              results of this first effort are extremely encouraging. Based on the d?18 O of
              ice, for example, there is clearly a useable record of past climate at Mt.
              Moulton extending back beyond 140,000 years. There is work to do, however, to
              realize the full potential of this horizontal ice core. The elemental and
              isotopic composition of trapped gases suggest some contamination with modern
              air, for example. As gas cross-dating of ice cores is the  current standard by
              which climate records are intercompared, we need to understand why and how the
              gas record is compromised before adding Moulton to our arsenal of ice core
              paleoclimate records. This award supports a collaborative effort between three
              institutions with following objectives: 1) to evaluate more thoroughly the
              integrity of the climatic record through shallow drilling of the blue ice area,
              as well as the snow field upslope from the blue ice; 2) to improve the
              radioisotopic dating of specific tephra layers; 3) to obtain baseline
              information about modern snowfall deposition, mean annual temperature, and wind
              pumping around the summit of Mt. Moulton; and  4) to study how firn
              densification differs when surface accumulation changes from net accumulation
              to net ablation.
