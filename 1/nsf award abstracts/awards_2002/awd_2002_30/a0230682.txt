Abstract    :
              Oakton Community College (OCC), in partnership with Maine Township High School
              District (three schools) and Niles Township High School District (two schools),
              is developing and piloting initiatives designed to increase the number of high
              school and Oakton students who pursue and receive degrees in the areas of
              science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The project has three
              key components: (1) the Summer Bridge Program; designed to help under-prepared
              students improve their math, English and study skills, (2) the Peer Tutor
              Training Program; aimed at recruiting high school juniors with exceptionally
              strong math skills (e.g., AP enrolled, National Honor Society) and train them
              to become Peer Tutors to assist OCC students who are struggling in STEM
              courses, and (3) the Student-Industry-Teacher Simulations (SIT SIMs) designed
              to augment STEM instruction in high school and community college settings with
              hands-on, contextualized learning modules developed by teams of industry
              professionals and community college STEM faculty. The STEM Club offers
              motivational activities such as encouraging all students to join and by hosting
              "Scholar, Expert, CEO Forum", visiting local business or companies,
              coordinating the AMATYC Math Competition, and holding other activities for
              career exploration in STEM. We are also working with four-year institutions to
              smooth students' transition from Oakton to the university.
