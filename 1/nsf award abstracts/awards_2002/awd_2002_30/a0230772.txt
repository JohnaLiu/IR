CISE CNPq:  US-Argentina and
              US-Chile Collaborative Research on Computer Science and Engineering

This is
              an award to support two workshops, each of two days duration in May 2000, in
              Chile and Argentina.  It is anticipated that these workshops will build on the
              success of the CISE/NSF programs with Mexico and Brazil (CONACyT and CNPq,
              respectively) to begin creating the collaborations and personal connections
              necessary to support the possibilities for similar government to government
              bilateral arrangements with Chile and Argentina.
