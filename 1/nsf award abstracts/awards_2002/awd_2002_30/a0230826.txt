Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to create a high performance Open Network
              Laboratory (ONL) for use by the networking research community, to enable
              experimental evaluation of advanced networking concepts in a realistic working
              environment. The laboratory will be built around a set of open-source,
              extensible, high performance routers that have been developed at Washington
              University, and which will be made available to remote users through a Remote
              Laboratory Interface (RLI) to be developed through this program. The interface
              will allow users to easily configure and run experiments, using a combination
              of web forms and a graphical user interface. It will also allow users to
              extend, modify or replace the software running in the routers' embedded
              processors and to similarly extend, modify or replace the routers' hardware,
              which is implemented largely using Field Programmable Gate Arrays, which can be
              dynamically reconfigured to support new capabilities.
