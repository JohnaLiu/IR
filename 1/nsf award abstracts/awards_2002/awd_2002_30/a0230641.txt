Abstract    :
              The need for effective teaching and learning is reflected in the national
              literature on education practices and in the recently revised accreditation
              criteria for schools of engineering - Engineering Criteria 2000 - recently
              implemented by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).
              Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC 2000) has been a catalyst for reform in
              engineering education, providing an opportunity to increase effectiveness of
              teaching and learning within the engineering curriculum.  The NMSU Bridges for
              Engineering Education (NMSU BEE) program, proposes to extend this emphasis on
              effective teaching and learning within engineering education to the pre-college
              level through a strongly aligned multi-level curriculum designed to attract
              students to the engineering profession, beginning at the middle school level,
              and ensure that they are academically prepared to be successful in university
              engineering programs. Full implementation of the interventions and strategies
              developed under this planning grant would provide important opportunities to
              local middle and high school students for enhancing their educational success
              early on in their pre-college schooling, thereby increasing their chances for a
              smooth and successful transition into the NMSU College of Engineering
              undergraduate degree programs.

Through this collaborative effort of middle
              and high school teachers and NMSU faculty from engineering, education, and the
              cognitive sciences, the goals are to develop a strong organizational structure
              grounded in a professional development framework that: 1) supports teachers and
              students in exploring and understanding engineering content in K-12 education
              through professional development activities and engineering-specific curriculum
              units, 2) improves the pedagogy in undergraduate engineering education in a
              manner that is responsive to the new ABET criteria and which incorporates
              writing-to-learn approaches and current theories of learning and cognition, 3)
              extends the application of and response to the ABET criteria in meaningful ways
              to the middle and high school levels; 4) results in a rich collection of data
              that can effectively contribute to curriculum revisions at all three levels;
              and 5) produces a responsive evaluation methodology that is accountable to the
              project's many stakeholders.
