This award supports the PI and graduate students from
              Northeastern University in a collaboration with Bernd Noack of the Hermann
              Fottinger Institute for Fluid Engineering at the Technical University of
              Berlin, Germany.  The combined efforts of the German and US groups will go
              toward research in control-oriented modeling and control flow for monitoring
              and controlling fluid flow systems.  They will derive models that reduce the
              computational burden ordinarily inherent in computational fluid dynamics
              calculations and are also effective for on-line predictive control.  Hybrid
              modeling techniques in combination with sensitivity analysis will lead to
              lighter-weight discrete and continuous models.  The flow systems to be studied
              represents an important class of system problems that have proven extremely
              difficult to model and control.  The progress the PIs achieve will have major
              implications for industrial control and scientific instrumentation.

The
              project also has an educational objective.  The project will allow the graduate
              students involved to benefit from performing research in another country.  They
              will develop a heightened appreciation of the world around them while also
              learning important new technical skills.
