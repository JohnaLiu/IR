This work will evaluate magmatic sulfidation and
              oxidation states in calc-alkaline granitic rocks. These measurements will be
              carried out on granitoid suites from the Bingham-Park City belt of Utah, the
              central Chile porphyry copper belt, and the Providencia-Concepcion del Oro area
              in the central Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico. Calculation of oxygen
              fugacity ranges over five orders of magnitude and sulfur fugacity over three
              orders of magnitude in different calc-alkaline granitoids. Mossbauer
              determination of Fe3+/Fe2+ and measurement of H2O in biotites will constrain
              redox reactions for biotite and provide another way to evaluate the redox state
              of these granitoids. In addition, systematic determinations of Ce4+/Ce3+ will
              be undertaken on zircons from the same suites of calc-alkaline granitoids. It
              is anticipated that these results will show that the granitoids possessed their
              unique redox signature throughout their crystallization history. The oxidation
              state of the magmas is most likely inherited from source regions rather than
              being imposed by late stage crystallization, wall-rock contamination,
              hydrothermal alteration or degassing history. Results of this study are
              expected to shed light on the source regions and evolution of calc-alkaline
              granitoids. Broader implications of this study relate to (1) impacts on climate
              by sulfur-bearing volcanic eruptions that are related to these granitoids, and
              (2) formation of porphyry copper ore bodies during their crystallization. The
              highly oxidized granitoids have sulfur mainly as sulfate, which is released in
              major volcanic eruptions to form sulfuric acid. These releases had a measurable
              impact on earth's climate during major eruptions of Mt. Pinutubo in the
              Philippines and El Chichon in Mexico. Porphyry copper ore deposits in the rock
              record are strongly correlated with emplacement of oxidized granitoids.
              Understanding this relationship is important for location of copper ores, most
              of which occur in these ore deposits.
