Abstract    :
              The proposed research seeks to quantify the contribution of surface ocean
              currents to the interannual variability in fresh water transport from the
              Arctic into the Greenland and Labrador seas.  It will then investigate links
              among this variability and atmospheric forcing, with an emphasis on modes of
              variability such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and will assess the
              roles of buoyancy fluxes and mechanical mixing in mixed layer depth as this
              relates to fresh water export from the Arctic.  This research builds on past
              work by the same investigator and will integrate a 3-D, coupled ice-ocean model
              run for 53 years using NCEP atmospheric forcing.  A simpler coupled model using
              a two-layer ocean will also be run, using idealized forcing and geometry, in
              order to clarify individual dynamic modes of the ocean-ice system and help to
              interpret the 3-D model simulations.
