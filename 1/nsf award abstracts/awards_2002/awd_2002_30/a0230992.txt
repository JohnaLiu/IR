Abstract    :
              The main goal of our project is to help engineering students become global
              engineers by learning to define and solve problems in the context of differing
              cultural and national perspectives. Another goal has been to evaluate and
              compare the effectiveness of two different approaches to student learning. Our
              project accomplishes these goals by developing and evaluating twelve
              multimedia-learning modules under the general title, "Engineering Cultures."
              Our first objective has been to complete final versions of eight prototype
              modules and develop four additional modules. Each module includes 3-5
              multimedia lessons (45-60 minutes each) on CDs, a one-hour multimedia
              Introduction to Engineering Cultures, an accompanying reader, a user's manual
              for students and instructors, sample quiz and exam questions for instructors,
              and a web database of supporting materials, including interviews with engineers
              from different countries. Our second objective is to evaluate the intellectual
              content of each module with the assistance of 24-30 content experts. Our final
              objective is to evaluate and compare student learning in semester-length
              multimedia and classroom versions of Engineering Cultures at each of two
              schools. Demo versions of the multimedia modules will be disseminated to
              engineering educators at engineering education conferences and via an upcoming
              ASEE national project on dissemination of best education practices. We expect
              Prentice Hall to serve as national and international distributor for the
              finished products.
