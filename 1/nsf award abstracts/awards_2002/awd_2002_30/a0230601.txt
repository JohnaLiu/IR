Abstract

The proposal will establish a bridge connecting
              engineering education in the
Donaghey College of Information Science and
              Systems Engineering (DCISSE) to the
College of Education (COE) at the
              University of Arkansas at Little Rock. A series of
three thematic engineering
              courses has been proposed to bring engineering education to
the pre-college
              educators, education majors, and high school students. The courses will
be
              implemented using Project-Based Experiential Learning (PBEL) philosophy that
              is
currently popular in Freshmen Design Experience Programs. The novelty of
              the proposed approach is that the courses will be designed to be intellectually
              substantive, taught on a just-in-time basis in context to a real-world problem,
              and the courses will also satisfy curricular requirements of engineering /
              engineering technology degree programs to insure that these do not function as
              service courses. The math prerequisites will be mid-level high school algebra,
              and the courses will be open to any student who wants to explore engineering.
              The enthusiasm for such an approach has been prompted by the success of a PBEL
              course that was initiated last fall in DCISSE, and cognitive scientists
              assertion that theoretical ideas are
much easier to learn when the theoretical
              understanding is closely coupled to real-world
experience.
