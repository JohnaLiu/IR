Abstract    :
              The project develops and implements a freshman oriented multi-disciplinary team
              design experience using distance collaboration between the University of
              Kentucky Lexington and Paducah campuses. The project addresses the following
              issues pertaining to first-year engineering programs:
a. There are few
              meaningful yet quantitative design experiences geared towards engineering
              freshmen. 
b. There is a need to introduce the concept of "distributed
              collaboration" to engineering students. Many engineers find themselves working
              as a member of a geographically distributed design team, despite the fact that
              they have not participated in such teams during college.
c. There is a need to
              increase the number of students entering the engineering field from
              underrepresented groups.

Teams of introductory engineering students from two
              campuses work on designing a mechanism or assembly using solid-modeling
              software that can then be prototyped using a 3-D printer. Group communication
              is facilitated using dedicated interactive video conferencing capabilities
              already in place at both locations, including web-based video and interactive
              television, and supplemented by telephone, email, and facsimile. Students from
              local high schools participate in full-day workshops to create a simple solid
              model, and see it fabricated by the 3-D printer. Each workshop includes tours
              of the engineering facilities, and a presentation outlining the career
              opportunities available in engineering.
