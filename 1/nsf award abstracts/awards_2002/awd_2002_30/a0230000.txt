Abstract

Project 2020, an Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University
              (ERAU) engineering curriculum
initiative, is a nine-month planning grant the
              primary goal of which is to create a
curriculum development demonstrator
              inspired by the Electronic Performance Support
System (EPSS) methodology used
              in the aerospace industry (Boeing), and adapted to the
university environment.
              A team composed of members from education and industry will
collaborate to
              achieve the goals.

This grant is the first step in achieving a larger vision
              defined by these sequential goals:
(1) create a curriculum development
              methodology inspired by the Electronic Performance
System used in the
              aerospace industry (Boeing), and adapted to the university
environment, the
              objective of this planning grant; (2) bring together appropriate
              cross-
discipline faculty to use the EPSS methodology for development of a
              curriculum
component such as a course or a semester of courses as a
              demonstration project; (3) use
the same faculty to conduct a one-semester
              demonstration project with university
engineering and technology students; (4)
              measure, assess, and compare the student
achievement and satisfaction of the
              demonstration group at various intervals to that of a
control group of
              students engaged in the traditional curriculum using
              outcomes-based
methodologies; (5) measure, assess, and compare faculty
              performance, workload and
satisfaction in both groups at various intervals;
              (6) evaluate the results of the
demonstration project and prepare a report;
              (7) share the results through workshops and
other media with other
              universities to encourage and support demonstration and
collaborative projects
              at those universities; and (8) implement the curriculum concepts on
a large
              scale across the university and between campuses within the university.
