TITLE: Planning Grant for Department-Level Reform of
              Undergraduate Engineering Education

Abstract

The Johns Hopkins
              University's (JHU) Whiting School of Engineering (WSE) plans to more
              effectively blend the content and pedagogy of the research process into the
              undergraduate engineering curriculum. This new model would structure courses,
              laboratory experiences, and optional summer programs to enhance and augment the
              standard departmental engineering curricula offered .The planning process would
              include the evaluation of courses, faculty, and facility resource requirements
              to more extensively integrate research into the engineering
              curriculum.

Mainly graduate students participate in the more complete
              research pedagogy to become more advanced critical thinkers (scholars), and
              through the collaborative learning process grow as role models (advisors). Even
              for graduate students the research process is taught on a one to one basis,
              with little, if any, formal course work that transforms the content of research
              as a process to teach creative thinking, experimental design and
              interpretation, grant writing, reporting and mentoring into the context of the
              engineering curriculum. Properly taught, research should engage the teaching
              and research faculty to apply collaborative, active learning techniques to
              teach a student how to select a research topic, to generate a hypothesis to
              test, to procure funding, to collaboratively design and implement an
              experiment, to analyze the data, and to justify to their peers the results.
