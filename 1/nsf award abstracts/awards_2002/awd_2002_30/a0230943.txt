Abstract    :
              Professor Steve Leone of University of Colorado is supported by the Experimental
              Physical Chemistry program to perform experimental studies on alignment and
              control of small molecules.   The work involves use of shaped ultrafast laser
              pulses for phase and amplitude control of electron dynamics within bonded
              species.   This proposal seeks to continue development of experimental methods
              in this area, this time utilizing triatomic molecules, e.g. SO2.  In addition,
              high rotor states of the Li dimer will be utilized.  Sophisticated genetic
              algorithms will be explored as a means of tailoring matter-field interactions
              to optimize a desired outcome.  The work will provide much needed data for
              theoretical advances in this area.

The ability to control molecular
              processes utilizing lasers could have implications in areas such as quantum
              information science.  This pioneering study will explore the capabilities and
              limitations of laser control of molecular events in diatomic and triatomic
              species.
