TITLE: Reforming Undergraduate Engineering Education
              Using an Integrated Platform for Learning

Abstract

The planning grant
              will be used to develop new curricula for both Electrical and Computer
              Engineering and Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State University. A platform
              for learning is used to integrate the curriculum..  Beginning in the freshman
              year, students build on the platform (in this case a robot we call TekBots) so
              that subject areas become connected and students have a context for their
              learning similar to what practicing engineers experience in their profession.
              As students take courses throughout the program, they apply their knowledge to
              this platform so that it becomes a representation of what they have learned and
              how the various topics they have learned are connected. A key part of
              developing this curriculum is also enhancing stakeholder-defined goals and
              outcomes such as those in the Accreditation Board for Engineering and
              Technology (ABET) criteria.  The proposed curriculum will be designed to
              specifically enhance these outcomes and, the will determine if and how much the
              platform for learning curriculum improves each of these outcomes.
