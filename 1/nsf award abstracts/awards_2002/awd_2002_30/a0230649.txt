TITLE: Use of a Vertically Integrated Team Design Project
              as an Adjunct to and Change Instrument for the Chemical Engineering Curriculum
              at The University of Akron

Abstract

This project will explore the use of
              the Vertically Integrated Team Design Project in an expanded role as a
              component of the chemical engineering curriculum and as a change instrument for
              the chemical engineering curriculum.

Enhancing the Vertically Integrated
              Team Design Project as a component of the ChE curriculum by:
o Increasing and
              improving the use of outside, industrial mentors
o Establishing the Vertically
              Integrated Team Design Project as an integral part of the core curriculum
o
              Increasing the assessment component of both the students participating in
              the
project and the project itself
o Developing additional project modules to
              incorporate emerging technologies as
the project themes

Planning for the
              use of the Vertically Integrated Team Design Project as a change instrument for
              the ChE curriculum by using it as:

o an assessment tool for specific
              affective and technical skills in our students
o a collaborative vehicle for
              involvement of industrial colleagues in shaping the
ChE curriculum
o a test
              bed for incorporating professional level computational tools into the core
ChE
              curriculum
o a test bed for material and methods intended to displace rote
              solution legacy
materials and methods in the core ChE curriculum

We believe
              that this use of a Vertically Integrated Team Design Project  will provide a
              tool for continuous improvement of our department's chemical engineering
              curriculum, the model should be very easily extensible to other chemical
              engineering departments and easily extensible to other engineering
              disciplines.
