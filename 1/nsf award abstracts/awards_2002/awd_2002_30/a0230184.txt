Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this research is to investigate basin-scale mechanisms that
              regulate freshwater content in the Arctic Ocean, and particularly in the
              Beaufort Gyre.  The research addresses the hypothesis that the Gyre accumulates
              fresh water from various sources during periods of anticyclonic (clockwise)
              wind forcing the then releases this fresh water when the wind forcing weakens
              or reverses to a cyclonic (anticlockwise) direction.  It is further
              hypothesized that this accumulation and release mechanism is responsible for
              observed salinity anomalies in the North Atlantic ocean, and for an observed
              decadal variability of the Arctic system.  The research will collect new field
              data and will synthesize these with historical data and model results to test
              these hypotheses. Expected results include identification of links among fresh
              water accumulation, atmospheric, hydrologic, cryospheric and oceanographic
              processes, quantification of the relevant fresh water fluxes, and assessment of
              the controlling factors under global warming conditions.  As an integrating
              mechanism, freshwater content of the Beaufort Gyre is expected to be a primary
              indicator of the Arctic Ocean response to climate change.
