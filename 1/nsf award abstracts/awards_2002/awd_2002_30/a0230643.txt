Abstract    :
              The objective of the project is to create an innovative learning environment
              that addresses the challenges of teaching stochastic modeling courses to
              undergraduate engineering and science students. The project develops four
              application-based modules to demonstrate the relevance of theory in practice
              and incorporates real-life applications into Industrial Engineering curriculum.
              The modules include visual media from industrial partners to present a problem
              with a web site that provides written module and reference material. The main
              topics covered in these modules include Brownian motion, reliability theory,
              queuing theory, Markov chains, and renewal theory.

Outcomes of this project
              consist of improved learning environment, exposure of students to technological
              tools, integration of advanced technology in the design and creation of the
              modules, and a curriculum package that is highly transferable to other programs
              and universities offering stochastic modeling courses.
