TITLE: The Bridge: Connecting Basic Math and
              Science with Engineering Design

Abstract

This grant will design and plan
              the implementation of an engineering systems core for all Florida Atlantic
              University engineering students that will use the engineering science
              fundamentals to bridge mathematics and the basic sciences with discipline
              studies and design. The systems approach will use the
framework of
              mathematical modeling to bring the engineering science fundamentals to
              life,show the integrated and  nterconnected nature of the seemingly disparate
              parts of an engineering problem, demonstrate how common the fundamentals are to
              all disciplines, and to expose students to the value of modeling and systems
              analysis in the design process. We believe that a well-integrated,
              carefully-managed, and practice-oriented systems core will result in measurable
              and significant improvements in the understanding of engineering science
              fundamentals, mathematics knowledge and skills, engineering design creativity
              and acumen, student retention, and performance on the Fundamentals of
              Engineering examination.
