Abstract    :
              Information and communication technologies continue to improve transportation
              data acquisition and performance monitoring capabilities for surface
              transportation systems.  Currently, little information has been extracted from
              the massive amounts of data being collected in real time by traffic management
              centers (TMC) nationwide.  Despite tremendous advances in transportation data
              collection technologies, no parallel efforts have been made to improve the
              existing performance measures by maximizing the utility of information
              extraction methods from both archived and real-time transportation data. 
              Current measures in the form of point estimates of average travel time and
              delay are essentially properties derived from first-order statistics and do not
              adequately reveal certain local and system-wide properties such as smoothness,
              coarseness, regularity, homogeneity, entropy, and others.  Such properties can
              only be unraveled by advanced procedures and second-order statistics that are
              capable of characterizing the quality of traffic operations by exploiting
              spatiotemporal dependencies and textural features of constructed spatiotemporal
              traffic contour maps, a concept that is similar to texture characterization of
              digital images.  

The primary objectives to be achieved in this research
              are:  (1) develop a new class of performance measures by quantifying special
              features of spatiotemporal contour maps; (2) study the behavior of traffic
              during transient stages using the new performance measures; (3) establish a
              procedure for on-line and off-line performance assessment for extended freeway
              segments; (4) investigate the correlation between the new measures and accident
              frequency and severity; (5) compare textural characteristics of recurrent and
              non-recurrent conditions; and (6) develop an implementation module of the new
              measures to be executed in real time by TMCs. The project examines
              spatiotemporal freeway traffic contour maps to improve the existing freeway
              performance measures and to identify precursor conditions for freeway
              congestion and crashes.  

Undergraduate students will be strongly encouraged
              to collaborate with graduate students in the various project research
              activities, which will introduce them to innovative basic/applied research
              techniques and strengthen their computational and programming skills.  Graduate
              students will have a leading role in the project and will find opportunities to
              work on contemporary research topics for their theses and dissertations.  The
              activities and findings of this project will lead to collaborative research
              opportunities with other disciplines at the intersection areas of
              transportation, information technology, and computer science/engineering.  It
              is also envisioned that this research study will potentially spark other ITS
              research activities that would extend benefits to both transportation system
              users and providers nationwide and within the state of Louisiana.
