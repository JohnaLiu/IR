INSTITUTION
              NAME: SUNY at Stony Brook
TITLE: Undergraduate Research and Development in the
              Engineering Curriculum

Abstract

The goal of this proposal is to develop a
              plan for curriculum revision that integrates the benefits 
of research
              experience into the more traditional engineering science and engineering degree
              programs at SUNY at Stony Brook. All our students (and not just the more
              advanced students) will develop the necessary skills for engineering research,
              which may include experimental design, searching the literature, performing
              research using modern scientific instruments and techniques, analyzing and
              interpreting data, and preparing a report for publication or presentation at an
              institutional, regional, or national scientific meeting. Then the curriculum
              will be revised so that  the benefits of research experience are integrated
              into the more traditional engineering science and engineering practice
              components of our educational programs.
