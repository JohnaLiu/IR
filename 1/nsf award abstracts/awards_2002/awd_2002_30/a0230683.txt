Abstract    :
              AST-9619576    Reconstructing the Magellanic Clouds Star Formation History from 
              a Digital UBVI Photometric Survey.    Dr. Zaritsky will investigate the global
              and spatially resolved  star formation history of the Magellanic Clouds in
              order to  better understand the evolution of galaxies in general and the 
              detailed evolution of the Clouds in particular.  This work will  produce the
              first large-scale UBVI digital survey of the  Magellanic Clouds to bridge
              studies of galaxy evolution that are  based on photometry of individual stars
              and those that utilize  integrated properties of galaxies.  The results of this
              research  are expected to provide a fundamental advance in the study of  galaxy
              evolution and provide the empirical constraints necessary  to test evolutionary
              models.  =====================================
