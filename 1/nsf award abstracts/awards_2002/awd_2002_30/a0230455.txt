Abstract    :
              This research proposes to assess the role of atmospheric forcing in linking land
              hydrology in the watersheds of the Lena, Yana, Indigirka and Kolyma rivers with
              the transport and fate of riverine waters to the Laptev and East Siberian seas.
               The underlying hypothesis couples elements of Arctic climate change, such as
              cyclone frequency and warming, with permafrost melting and increased river
              runoff that lead, in turn, to increased flux of dissolved and solid terrestrial
              matter to the shelf seas.  It is hypothesized, additionally, that shifts
              between the cyclonic and anticyclonic modes of atmospheric circulation over the
              central Arctic, in response to the phasing of the Arctic Oscillation (AO),
              drive environmental shifts in the Laptev and East Siberian seas.  These
              hypotheses will be tested through acquisition, syntheses and analyses of
              atmospheric, land and ocean hydrological, and hydrochemical data for the Lena
              River-Laptev Sea and East Siberian land-shelf systems. The research will
              involve analyses of two existing sets of frozen water, sediment and particulate
              matter samples obtained in 2000 and 2002 from the Laptev and East Siberian
              seas.
