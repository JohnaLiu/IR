Abstract    :
              This SGER proposal is an outgrowth of collaboration between Horn Point
              Laboratory,
University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science and the
              University of Trieste and
the Laboratory for Marine Biology, Trieste, Italy.
              It is to support the participation of
DK Stoecker and a graduate student in an
              Italian expedition to the Ross Sea during the
austral summer 2002-2003.
              Techniques which have been recently developed to investigate
the autecology
              and population dynamics of temperate, coastal bloom-forming algae will
              be
applied to polar protists from the Ross Sea. This collaboration presents a
              tremendous
opportunity to compare the role of microzooplankton grazing in
              bloom dynamics in temperate
and polar systems, determine if polar
              microplankton have ectocellular protease activity
and to obtain samples of the
              photosynthetic ciliate, Mesodinium rubrum and its crytophyte
algal "prey" from
              the Ross Sea for molecular analysis. Futhermore, the cruise would
contribute
              to the education of a graduate student in polar science and provide
              material
for his dissertation. It would also contribute to continued
              collaboration between UMCES
and the Marine Biological Laboratory in Trieste,
              Italy.
