Abstract    :
              This project will utilize data from the Geotail and Wind satellites to
              characterize the state of the Earth's plasma sheet during different geomagnetic
              conditions.  It will examine the differences seen during periods of steady
              magnetospheric convection (SMC), magnetic substorms and magnetic storms. 
              Additional data will be obtained from the Cluster satellite mission, in
              particular using the wide band plasma wave data and the electron drift (EDI)
              data.  Additional data sets will include ground magnetometer data and
              geomagnetic indices as well as data from the ACE and WIND spacecraft specifying
              the conditions in the solar wind (interplanetary magnetic field and the solar
              wind speed and dynamic pressure).
