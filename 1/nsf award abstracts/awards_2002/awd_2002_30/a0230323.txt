The oxidation of metal sulfide minerals can generate
              solutions that have pH values as low as -3.6 and contain less than 190 g H2O
              per liter of solution.  Such acid rock drainage can be generated in any
              locality where sulfides are exposed to the weathering process, including mine
              workings and wastes, exposed coastal sediments, and exposures of ancient marine
              sedimentary rocks.  These solutions have a high environmental impact that is
              estimated to be in the billions of dollars in North America alone.  Acid rock
              drainage has also generated large ore deposits, makes possible the economic
              recovery of copper and other metals from disseminated mineralization, and hosts
              some unusual microbial communities.  The ability to model the chemistry of
              these systems accurately would aid greatly in efforts to remediate
              environmentally sensitive sites, improve the recovery of metals by
              hydrometallurgic processes, and better understand the processes that control
              diurnal and seasonal variations in the chemistry of acid rock drainage.  Such
              detailed modeling is currently impossible for many systems: activity
              coefficients are lacking for strongly acidic ferric sulfate brines as are some
              basic equilibrium constants needed to model the aqueous and mineral species
              effectively.  This project will take three steps to remove some of those
              obstacles.  1)Osmotic coefficients of ferric sulfate and mixed ferric-ferrous
              sulfate brines will be measured.  The data will be modeled to retrieve
              interaction parameters necessary to calculate activity coefficients using the
              specific ion interaction model.  2)The association constants for ferric sulfate
              complexes will be measured using a mercury/mercurous sulfate concentration
              cell.  These association constants will be necessary to complete the activity
              modeling.  3)The solubility of jarosite will be measured over a range of
              temperatures and ionic strength and in different ionic media.  This research
              will improve significantly the ability to accurately model natural acid-sulfate
              waters.
