TITLE: Reengineering
              The Undergraduate IEMS Program

Abstract

Reengineering the Undergraduate
              IEMS Program

The purpose of this grant is to assess, strategize, and
              generate plans for enhancing the undergraduate program in the Department of
              Industrial Engineering and Management Systems at The University of Central
              Florida.  Enhancement of the Undergraduate program should yield the following:
              an increased attraction by students to pursue degrees in IE, better retention
              of students in IE majors, and better preparation of IE graduates to meet the
              future workforce needs of engineers employed in a high-tech society. 
              Additionally, planning efforts undertaken in this proposed planning grant will
              help to establish a framework that can be used by Industrial Engineering
              departments interested in improving their courses, curriculum, methods of
              delivery, instructional strategies, and overall preparation of their graduates.
               Planning activities undertaken in this proposed  grant will initially be
              disseminated through the following venues: American Society of Engineering
              Education Conferences, Institute of Industrial Engineering National Conference,
              IIE Council of Academic Department Heads, ASEE Journal of Engineering
              Education, ASEE Prism Magazine, and the UCF WWW.  

The specific objectives
              to be pursued during this planning grant to ensure that the 
overall goals of
              this project are met include: 1) developing plans for introducing 
emerging
              topics into the IE curriculum; 2) developing plans for increasing student
              
holistic problem solving capabilities; 3) developing plans for including more
              
experiential/active learning exercises; 4) developing plans for incorporating
              more 
technology into classrooms; 5) developing plans for improving
              instructional strategies 
and faculty professional development; 6) developing
              plans for enhancing professional 
development and leadership capabilities of
              students; and 7) developing plans for 
exploiting partnerships to increase the
              number of talented students in IE disciplines.
