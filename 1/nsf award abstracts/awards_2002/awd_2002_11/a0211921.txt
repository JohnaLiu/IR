Abstract    :
              Ethylene is an unique plant signaling molecule.  The hydrocarbon gas, known as
              the fruit ripening hormone, controls many aspects of plant growth and
              development.  It is biosynthesized from methionine via a three-step enzymatic
              process:

				SAM		ACC		ACC
		Methionine		SAM		ACC		C2H4.
			         
              Synthase                 synthase	             oxidase

Its synthesis is
              highly regulated.  Experimental evidence accumulated over the last 10 years
              indicates that one of the key enzymes in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway,
              1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase (ACS), is encoded by a
              highly divergent multigene family in various mono- and dicotyledonous plants. 
              The completion of the Arabidopsis genome sequence reveals the presence of 10
              putative ACS genes (ACS2, 4-12) and two pseudogenes (ACS1, ACS3).  Expression
              studies reveal that the family members are differentially regulated by various
              inducers and developmental stages  Studies on the regulation of the ACS genes
              in Arabidopsis are proposed here to gain insight into the details of the
              signaling machinery involved primarily in the regulation of the ACS gene by
              auxin and ethylene.  Further studies are proposed to obtain knowledge regarding
              the structure and the biochemical properties of the ACS isoenzymes.  The
              proposed molecular and biochemical experimental approaches attempt to answer
              the following question: why are there 10 ACC synthase isoenzymes in Arabidopsis
              for the synthesis of the ethylene precursor ACC?  While all of them have the
              same biochemical function, the question arises whether they have distinct or
              redundant biological function.  The findings have the potential to allow a
              fundamental understanding of the role of multigene families in plants, a
              hallmark finding of the Arabidopsis Genome Sequencing project.
