Abstract    :
              West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus that is native to Europe, Asia and eastern
              Africa.  It appeared in New York City in 1999 and has since spread to much of
              the eastern USA.  Models of WNV spread in the New World are clarifying the
              relative roles of both the mosquito host and other vectors, especially
              migratory birds.  Recent reports place WNV in the Caribbean, which has serious
              consequence for endemic bird species in the region, many of which are endanger.
               This project will support more detailed models and a program of sampling will
              further document the arrival of WNV in the Caribbean and help predict its
              spread and possible containment.
