Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to create new synthetic routes for the preparation
              of resorcinol and phloroglucinol from glucose.  A pathway using the
              intermediacy of gallic acid/pyrogallol,
              2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose/hydroxyhydroquinone or
              myo-2-inosose/1,2,3,4-tetrahydroxybenzene will be explored as will a pathway
              involving the intermediacy of hexahydroxybenzene and pentahydroxybenzene
              derived from myo-inositol and myo-2-inosose.  Microbes will be constructed that
              are capable of high-yielding, high-titer conversions of glucose into gallic
              acid, myo-inositol, 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose and myo-2-inosose.  Also,
              experiments will be conducted to compare the microbial synthesis and reaction
              in near-critical water of 3-dehydroquinic, 3-dehydroshikimic and protocatechuic
              acids as routes for the synthesis of catechol from glucose.  

With this
              renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
              the research of Dr. John W. Frost of the Department of Chemistry at Michigan
              State University.  Professor Frost will focus his work on devising methodology
              to prepare aromatic chemicals from carbohydrate precursors.  These methods will
              allow for the replacement of toxic starting materials such as benzene.  The
              research has broad and important potential impact for the chemical industry and
              for the environment in general.  The research also provides an excellent
              training ground for graduate students and postdoctorals.
