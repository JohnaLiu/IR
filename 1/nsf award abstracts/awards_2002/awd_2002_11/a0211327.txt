Abstract    :
              Assisted reproduction practices- laboratory and clinical techniques that enable
              genetic human reproduction- are becoming increasingly prominent in Latin
              America as viable and preferred options for creating a "family of one's own."
              Significantly, Latin America is not the only "Third World" region where the
              research and development of reproductive technologies are proliferating. Yet
              biotechnologies are often assumed to be culturally neutral, bringing a standard
              form of scientific modernity to any setting in which they appear. This
              dissertation project, conducted by a student of cultural anthropology from the
              University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, will focus on the community of
              reproductive medicine specialists in Buenos Aires so to examine the social
              processes and motivations guiding the acceptance and production of assisted
              reproduction practices in Argentina. Through ethnographic methods of
              participant observation, semi-structured interviews and archival research, this
              project will investigate the local specificities of assisted reproduction: how
              do these procedures engage and respond to particular ideas about science,
              modernity and religion, values of genetic inheritance and parenthood, and
              economic and political pressures. Because reproductive medicine is a
              fast-growing field with far-reaching social and ethical consequences, it is
              important to understand the processes by which reproductive technologies are
              enacted locally according to social, political, and economic circumstances.
              This project will contribute a culturally-nuanced analysis that will inform
              both academic and policy discussions on the ethical, legal and social
              implications of assisted reproduction.
