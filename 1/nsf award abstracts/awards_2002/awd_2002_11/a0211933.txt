Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to use
              novel polymer processing techniques to fabricate high quality, inexpensive
              polymer (plastic) optical fiber image guides and other highly customized
              endoscopic devices. Polymer based imaging guides have several distinct
              advantages over their glass counterparts. The key advantages include reduced
              cost, a smaller bend radius, and increased ruggedness. Additional benefits
              include the ability to dope the polymer matrix with molecules that can be used
              as environmental probes or indicators, to tailor the imaging guide for
              specialized applications, and to impart diverse functionality into a single
              imaging guide. The cost of the polymer imaging guide is expected to be
              significantly lower than those currently in use. This will allow the polymer
              guides to be used as disposables if desired. Disposable endoscopes for one-time
              use will eliminate the need for sterilization, which is costly, often
              unreliable and time-consuming.

The commercial applications of this project
              will be in the area of medical devices and instrumentation.
