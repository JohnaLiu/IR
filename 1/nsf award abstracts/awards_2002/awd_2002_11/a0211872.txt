Abstract    :
              

The relationship between eukaryotic viruses and their hosts are
              characteristic of most
host-pathogen relationships that have co-evolved. The
              outcomes of virus-host interactions are genetically pre-determined. To produce
              disease, viruses must enter the host, multiply locally in host tissues, spread
              from the site of entry, and overcome or evade host immune responses. Plants
              have evolved various anti-viral defense strategies to clear viral infection. On
              the other hand, viruses have evolved counter-defense strategies. Therefore, it
              is important to understand molecular mechanisms of how viruses evade the host's
              antiviral defenses.

A Tobacco Rattle Virus-based virus induced gene
              silencing (VIGS) system will be used to identify suppressors of viral
              resistance and susceptibility factors. In addition, a functional proteomics
              approach will be used to study virus-host interactions. The knowledge gained
              from these studies will help to combat infectious plant diseases. Protection of
              crops from disease can significantly improve agricultural production.
              Application of a plant's own defense mechanism can lead to more effective
              protection against plant pathogens. Control of pathogen-induced diseases using
              cellular genes that function in the disease resistance signaling pathway may
              provide tremendous agricultural benefits and serve the environment by offering
              an alternative to pesticide use to prevent disease. Tools and information
              developed  in this project will be made available to the scientific community.
              These resources will assist in the efforts to improve economically important
              plants like tomato, potato and pepper.
