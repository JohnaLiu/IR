Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase Iproject proposes to develop
              a urea sensor using enzyme polyurethane polymers. The product concept is
              inexpensive, very easy to use and requires no additional analytical equipment
              or electricity. The strict specificity of the enzymes used in its formulation
              will provide the sensor with high precision in detecting urea and should limit
              false positive and negative signals. Sampling of surfaces and solutions will
              require only 1 simple step, limiting the potential for user error. Finally,
              rapid response times, on the order of a few minutes, will correspond well with
              the target applications of the sensor. 

The commercial applications of this
              project will be in the area of regulatory testing linked to the food service
              industry and  health care establishments. Because improper cleaning practices
              of restrooms can lead to bacterial contamination, the use of urea-detecting
              sensors in hospital bathroom facilities may aid in reducing patient infection
              rates.
