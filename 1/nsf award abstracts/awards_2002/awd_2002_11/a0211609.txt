              Project Summary
This proposal seeks $ 15,000 from NSF to support fifteen $
              1,000 graduate student and
postdoctoral travel stipends for participation in
              the Society for Conservation Biology
annual meeting at the University of Kent
              in Canterbury, U.K., July 14-19, 2002.
Participants will be selected based on
              the conceptual significance of the conservation
biology issue addressed
              including: quality of the research design and analysis;
applicability of the
              research to environmental problem solving; written organization and
data
              presentation; merit and feasibility of the applicant&#8217;s rationale for why
              her
(his) research will be substantially enhanced through participation in the
              U.K. meeting,
as well as how (s)he will disseminate results from the
              experience upon return to the U.S.
(e.g., through networks developed at the
              meeting or through local chapters of the SCB).
Participants will co-author an
              article about the meeting for the November, 2002, SCB
Newsletter.
