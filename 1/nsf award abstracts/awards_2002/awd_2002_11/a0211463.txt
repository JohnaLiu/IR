Abstract    :
              New scientists and students will be strongly encouraged to attend the Fourth
              International Conference on Borate Glasses, Crystals, and Melts.  This meeting
              will take place at Coe College in Cedar Rapids, IA from July 14-18, 2002.  In
              particular, women and minority members will be actively sought out and invited
              to participate in the meeting.  There are many recent developments within the
              field that will be addressed including:  new variations of spectroscopic
              techniques that are capable of probing the intermediate range order in borate
              glasses, novel preparation techniques, reports of new non-oxide
              boron-containing glasses and crystals, industrial uses of borates, improvements
              in computer modeling of atomic structure, and recent advances in out knowledge
              of related crystalline compounds.

The most important aspect of this
              project will be the very strong student participation in this meeting, at both
              the undergraduate and graduate levels.  We think our approach is justified
              because it will result in: a much stronger than usual involvement of students
              at a professional meeting, more scientific interactions between students from
              different research groups, and feedback to those who make presentations from an
              excellent cross-section of experienced scientists in the field.  A critical
              mass of 50 to 75 students will encourage their full participation in the
              conference.   Several discussion sessions targeting students and new scientists
              will be scheduled.  We believe this approach may serve as a model for student
              and new scientist participation in scientific conferences in the future.
