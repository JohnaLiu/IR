Abstract    :
              This dissertation enhancement grant supports Bradley Taylor under the direction
              of Robert O. Hall of the University of Wyoming to study the impacts of a
              migratory detrivorous fish on nitrogen cycling in a tropical stream in
              Venezuela. This award supports research that is novel in integrating the
              impacts of a single fish species on multiple components of the nitrogen cycle.
              Ecologists are fundamentally interested in the degree to which organisms
              influence ecosystem structure and function. Although much attention has focused
              on the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem function for plant
              taxa, our understanding of how animals influence ecosystem function is still in
              its infancy.

This proposal focuses on migratory fish (Prochilodus mariae)
              that is a potentially strong interactor in tropical Andean streams and builds
              on previous work to test whether this single species affects the stream
              nitrogen cycle, a fundamental component of ecosystem function.
