Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the
              fundamental
issues limiting the applications of Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride/Cadmium
              Telluride radiation detectors. Currently, x-ray and gamma ray equipment
              industry producing medical imaging, manufacturing, and security inspection
              instrument is a multi-billion dollar business. Room temperature
              Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride/Cadmium Telluride detectors and arrays appear to be the
              obvious choice as the sensing elements. However, after forty years of research,
              many problems remain. It was not clear why the yield in producing
              Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride/Cadmium Telluride detectors is still so low. Based on
              semiconductor physics, two parameters are most crucial in determining the
              detector performance: the need of the deep level of donor or acceptors to pin
              the Fermi level near the middle of the bandgap and the necessity to avoid
              defects which trap the carriers. 
     Potential commercial applications of
              the research can be used by researchers at accelerator laboratories for
              particle analysis, by scientists for crystallography, by security personnel for
              inspection, by engineers for the control of packaging such as bottling, and for
              numerous medical applications.
