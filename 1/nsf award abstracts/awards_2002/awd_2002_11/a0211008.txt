Title: The Link Between
              Information Technology Research and Education, Teaching and Learning

The
              principal investigator (PI) of this proposal is seeking support for an event in
              early March 2002 that is a combination of a principal investigator's meeting
              for ITR awardees and a workshop for senior researchers and young investigators
              in learning technologies.  The purpose of the event is to reflect upon the
              experiences, culture, and community of research in the learning technologies to
              develop ideas that would inform a CISE-focused learning technology initiative
              in FY 2002.

Conversations with and observations of many recent ITR, CRLT,
              LIS, and KDI awardees have revealed that there is a kind of tacit knowledge
              involved in building communities of researchers and practitioners in the
              emerging learning technology field.  Often, such tacit knowledge becomes
              apparent as a project matures and thus its study and capture may be unjustified
              at the time of proposal submission.  Since learning technology has such strong
              practical threads, tacit knowledge gained from theory building and research
              should inform practice to reduce the time required for research and theories to
              find their way into real-world learning environments.

There is reason to
              believe that the event as proposed will offer a much needed venue to discuss
              this tacit knowledge and the role CISE should have in expanding research and
              practice in learning technology.  Collaboration, reflection and introspection,
              diversity of stakeholders, and long-term sustainability are some of the topics
              expected to be explored within the contexts of simulation, visualization, and
              modeling; distance and online learning; embedding learning assessment and
              analyzing learner data; cultural, cognitive, and social dynamics; and virtual
              laboratories and remote instrumentation.

I strongly recommend that the
              proposal be funded the level of $125,000.
