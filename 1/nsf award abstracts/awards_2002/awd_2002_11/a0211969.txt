Abstract    :
              0211969
Moran, Mickel, and Motley
	The fern genus Elaphoglossum contains about
              650 species and is one of the world's largest fern genera. Most species occur
              in the American tropics, particularly in Central America and the Andean
              countries. This three-year grant will enable scientists at The New York
              Botanical Garden to continue their collaborative taxonomic study of the genus.
              Using evidence from DNA sequences and morphology, they will produce an
              evolutionary tree to the species and use this tree as a framework for
              addressing questions about evolution and biogeography. Examples of some
              evolutionary questions they will pose are: What are the main evolutionary
              groups within Elaphoglossum?  How does the evolutionary tree obtained from DNA
              studies compare to a previous classification system based on morphology? Did
              certain critical morphological characters evolve once within the genus, or did
              they arise several times? Examples of biogeographic questions are: How many
              different introductions of Elaphoglossum species have occurred onto the
              Hawaiian Islands, and what were their geographic source areas? What are the
              evolutionary relationships between the species in the American tropics and
              Africa-Madagascar? To answer these questions, it is necessary to collect
              samples of the species in various parts of the world. Field trips will be taken
              to species-rich countries in Latin America, such as Ecuador and Bolivia, and
              several colleagues will be collecting plants in the tropics of Africa,
              Madagascar, and Asia. The samples will be used to study morphological
              characteristics and to extract and sequence DNA, all aimed at providing data to
              construct an evolutionary tree. 
	This research will address major
              evolutionary and biogeographic questions about one of the world's largest
              groups of ferns. The results should provide a useful basis for comparison to
              other groups of plants. One spin-off of this project is that many new species
              will be discovered and provided with scientific names. The study will have
              educational benefits to the post-doctoral scientist and graduate students
              involved in the project, including training in both laboratory methods for
              studying DNA and fieldwork in the American tropics. Dr. Moran teaches the
              Tropical Plant Systematics course (both English and Spanish versions) in Costa
              Rica for the Organization for Tropical Studies, and will involve students in
              this course in field projects relating to the proposed research.  Several
              members of the New York Chapter of the American Fern Society will grow spores
              to study the characteristics of the gametophytes (the sexual phase of the life
              cycle) and will thus be involved in the project. The public and scientists will
              be informed about activities and results on the project's web site, the
              "Elaphoglossum homepage" maintained at the New York Botanical Garden.
