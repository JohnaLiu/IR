This LTREB project will continue an 11-year climate manipulation
              experiment and a 6-year climate-gradient study, thereby providing longer-term
              data sets to be used to test two hypotheses concerning the linkages between
              climate and ecosystems. The first hypothesis relates to the effect of climate
              warming on carbon sequestration, the second to climate controls on plant
              species richness. Climate change can alter carbon stocks in plants, litter, and
              soil, resulting in feedback which could either enhance or retard the
              anthropogenic buildup of atmospheric CO2. Such feedback could be especially
              strong in montane and high-latitude ecosystems where soils are carbon-rich,
              vegetation is sensitive to climatic variables such as length of growing season,
              and climate change is expected to be large due to snow-albedo feedback. The
              complexity of whole ecosystems renders prediction of the magnitude of this
              carbon-balance feedback a major challenge in ecology today.
