The proposers will
              organize the East Coast Computer Algebra Day (ECCAD), which is a
one-day
              regional conference on computer algebra, its applications and related
              technological
developments. ECCAD has been held annually at a variety of North
              American locations on
the East Coast since 1994. The ninth meeting in the
              series will be held on Saturday, May 18,
2002, at LaGuardia Community College,
              Long Island City, New York. The proposers will
invite three speakers for
              featured presentations, and organize contributed poster/software
demo
              sessions, covering the various aspects of computer algebra: algorithms,
              software imple-mentation,
and applications. They expect about 70 to 100
              researchers, post graduate and graduate students to participate, with most of
              the attendees coming from the North East, but also many from all over North
              America and even Europe.
In addition to invitations to the many universities
              and institutions along the East Coast where significant research in symbolic
              computation is going on, the 2002 ECCAD will be made a (separately funded) part
              of the Faculty Development Program of The City University of New York (a
              minority institution), and the proposers will specifically encourage faculty
              and students from all campuses of CUNY to participate.
