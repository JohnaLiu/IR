              Award Abstract

Rice, the second plant genome to be completely sequenced, has
              a relatively small genome of about 430 million base pairs.  While rice is also
              amenable to genetic studies and transformation and is a model system for genome
              studies of the cereals, it is also an important crop.   Currently, there are
              few tools for identifying the functions of sequenced genes for rice that are
              readily available to the research community.  

One of the most effective
              approaches to deciphering gene functions is through gene disruption by DNA
              insertions.  In this project, we will develop efficient transposon tagging
              strategies for large-scale insertion mutagenesis in rice.  Stable insertion
              lines will be generated containing random insertions of the maize En/Spm
              transposons in japonica rice cv. Nipponbare, which is the cultivar selected for
              the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project.  A publicly accessible
              database for reverse genetics containing sequences of DNA flanking insertions
              will be established, and the sequences will be linked to the rice genome
              database and the rice genome physical map.  Overall, this project should
              develop a valuable resource for functional genomics in rice, as well as other
              cereals.
