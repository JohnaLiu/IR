Abstract    :
              The Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division and the Polymers
              Program in the Division of Materials Research make this award to Pennsylvania
              State University to design and synthesize four different types of hybrid
              polymers containing poly (organophosphazenes).  With this award, Professor
              Allcock will synthesize poly phosphazene containing hybrid block polymers, and
              polymers with poly phosphazene linear or cyclic side chains and phosphazene
              rings connected by organic chains.  Different reaction chemistries such as ROMP
              and ADMET polymerizations will be used to prepare these multifunctional
              polymers, and they are expected to exhibit a combination of properties not
              amenable by each class of polymers separately.  Functional properties of these
              polymer hybrids may find applications in drug delivery systems, fuel cells, and
              solid-state energy storage and electro-optical devices.  Strengthened education
              and outreach programs in polymer sciences will be another outcome of this
              award.   

With this award, hybrid materials containing polyphosphazenes will
              be designed and synthesized, and these polymers are expected to find
              applications in drug delivery systems, fuel cells, and solid-state energy
              storage and electro-optical devices.  A number of polymerization chemistries
              will be used to prepare these multifunctional hybrid materials with improved
              performance and functionalities.  In addition, research and educational
              opportunities in polymer sciences will be provided to students with this award.
