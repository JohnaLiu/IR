Abstract    :
              Exothermic reactions are used in the chemical, petrochemical, and pharmaceutical
              industries.  Control of these reactions is important because the loss of
              control can lead to thermal runaways, which can cause accidents with
              environmental damage, injuries, and sometimes fatalities.  A way for dealing
              with runaway reactions is inhibition which involves injecting small quantities
              of an inhibitor into a reactor or storage vessel at the earliest stage of a
              runaway.

This project will focus on the study of reaction rates,
              temperatures, and pressures under adverse conditions, such as loss of cooling,
              loss of agitation, and unusual kinetics.  The studies will use (1) a new
              simulation model with three mixing zones to characterize runaway reactions with
              perfect mixing versus imperfect mixing, (2) computational fluid dynamics models
              to copmater the effects of agitation under turbulent and micromixing
              conditions, and (3) design of experiment (DOE) methods to effectively identify
              methods to inhibit runaways.  The results will ultimately also be used to
              highlight future problems and limitations when reactions are faster and
              reactors are smaller.

Impact:

Knowledge created by this project could
              ultimately improve the chemical industry's safety performance and image.  In
              addition, the PIs plan to develop chemical process safety educational material
              for use in undergraduate chemical engineering courses, a mechanism for
              introducing safety related issues into the curriculum.
