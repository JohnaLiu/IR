Abstract    :
              With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
              Robert West, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin,
              Madison, is exploring mulitply-bonded and low-coordinate compounds of silicon
              and germanium. Professor West synthesizes new types of organosilicon and
              organogermanium compounds containing multiple bonds, including silynes
              (RSiCR'), germynes (RGeCR'), 1,3-disilaallenes (R2Si=C=SiR2),
              1,3-digermaallenes (R2Ge=C=GeR2), polysilyne polymers [(RSi=CR')n], and
              silafullerenes such as C58Si2. He then studies the chemical reactions of these
              unusual molecules, including their activity as polymerization catalysts and as
              precursors to stable silylenium ions, and their halophilic
              reactions.

Although our understanding of the chemistry of compounds
              containing carbon has become quite sophisticated, the chemistry of carbon's
              closely related relatives, silicon and germanium, is comparatively undeveloped.
              Professor Robert West, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
              Wisconsin, Madison, is studying the synthesis and reaction chemistry of a
              series of compounds in which one or more carbon atoms are replaced by silicon
              or germanium. These studies are of fundamental importance in developing our
              understanding of the chemistry of the other elements in the periodic table. In
              addition, the unusual structures of Professor West's target compounds promise
              potential advances in practical reaction chemistry, including polymerization
              reactions.
