Abstract    :
              Fast hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms in the energy range 1-100 eV and
              higher are produced in the earth's upper atmosphere through phenomena such as
              photodissociation, radiative recombination, dissociative recombination,
              dissociative attachment, charge exchange, and superelastic (quenching)
              collisions. Many of these phenomena are induced by lightning discharges, which
              are responsible for emissions known as elves, red sprites, and blue jets. The
              fast atoms collide with species such as N2, O2, NO, H2O, CO2, etc. to produce,
              either through chemical reaction or direct excitation of the target, emissions
              in the upper atmosphere and thermosphere such as the hydrogen nighttime and
              polar-cusp aurora, and the hot oxygen corona and geocorona. 

Using a unique
              experimental facility at JPL, constructed with prior NSF support, fast
              ground-state hydrogen and oxygen atoms will be generated in the laboratory
              energy range 2-100 eV. The fast atoms will be used to study two classes of
              atmospheric reactions with the important species N2, O2, and NO. These classes
              are (a) infrared (vibrational) excitation and emission, where cross sections
              are measured using an integrating sphere coupled to a HgCdTe infrared detector;
              and (b) electron-capture and stripping, where cross-section and mass/charge
              ratio measurements are made using a Penning ion trap.
