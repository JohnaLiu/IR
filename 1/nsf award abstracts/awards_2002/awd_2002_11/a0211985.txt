Abstract    :
              Three mechanisms that promote the persistence of populations in uncertain
              environments are: 1) a variable age at maturation, 2) repeated reproduction,
              and 3) dispersal between populations. The project will study 18 amphibian
              species that breed in a complex of 32 natural sinkhole ponds.  All individuals
              of 7 species are photographed whenever they are captured. Computer-assisted
              matching of these images yields data for capture-recapture models to estimate
              population sizes and vital rates. These estimates will allow direct evaluation
              of population dynamics and persistence in uncertain environments under
              realistic assumptions. 
The detailed model for the most common focal species,
              Ambystoma opacum, will guide construction of an individual-based model for
              Ambystoma tigrinum, a species listed as endangered in several states.
              Population dynamics in spatially and temporally varying environments comprise
              an important area of population biology because they determine the context of
              life history adaptation and population differentiation. This study is also
              important because population ecology is the foundation for community ecology
              and for the development of plans for managing populations for harvest, pest
              control, or conservation action.
The request for imaging equipment is
              supported within this award as part of NSF's Facilitation Awards for Scientists
              and Engineers with Disabilities, a funding mechanism that enables scientists
              with disabilities to more fully engage in the research process. The project
              will support doctoral and post-doctoral research. Undergraduates will be
              employed as field assistants during the summer.
