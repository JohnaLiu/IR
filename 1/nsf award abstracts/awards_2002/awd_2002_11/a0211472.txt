Abstract    :
              This award supports the Gordon Research Conference on Biogenic Volatile Organic
              Compounds (VOCs) scheduled to take place at Queens College, Oxford, UK,
              September 1-6, 2002.  The meeting has been organized to bring together plant
              physiologists, ecophysiologists, and atmospheric chemists to discuss plant
              emissions of hydrocarbons.  A significant fraction of the VOCs emitted to the
              atmosphere in the U.S. are derived from plants.  The most abundant of these,
              isoprene, can play an important role in the formation of ozone and other air
              pollutants and is therefore of general concern to the public.  The study of
              oxidation processes in the atmosphere and ozone formation is of central
              relevance to the atmospheric chemistry.  This meeting will bring together an
              interdisciplinary team of scientists to assess research issues of common
              interest to both atmospheric scientists and plant physiologists.
