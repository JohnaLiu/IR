Abstract    :
              Atmospheric models used to predict precipitation and the effects of clouds on
              solar and terrestrial radiation are sensitive to variations in the types of ice
              crystals in clouds and their concentration, yet the processes by which drops
              freeze in clouds are not understood well enough to make reliable estimates of
              the ice content.  This project is an investigation of the atmospheric relevance
              of several droplet freezing mechanisms that have been suggested on the basis of
              laboratory observations or theory.  These include homogeneous freezing of
              solution drops and heterogeneous freezing as a result of evaporation that
              creates either organic surface films or solid phase inclusions within drops. 
              Numerical modeling of these processes will be compared with existing data from
              several field programs to determine the extent to which the modeling results
              can be brought into accord with observations.  One of the objectives is to
              study the conditions under which evaporation at the edges of clouds can promote
              freezing by heterogeneous nucleation.  Another is to attempt to explain recent
              observations indicating that the homogeneous freezing temperature of solution
              drops depends only on the water activity, a measure of the reduction in
              equilibrium vapor pressure of the drop compared to pure water.  Results of this
              research will contribute fundamentally to understanding ice formation in the
              atmosphere, and thus enable the improvement of weather and climate models in
              which the details of cloud composition are important.
