NSF supported a Special Session on Hybrid Systems as
              part of the Eighteenth Workshop on the Mathematical Foundations of Programming
              Semantics (MFPS 18), March 20-25, 2002 at Tulane University.  This meeting was
              also held concurrently with the Clifford Lectures of the Mathematics Department
              at Tulane University, which focused on mathematical logic and computer science.
               Research in areas relevant to MFPS focus in theoretical computer science,
              programming semantics, including domain theory, logics such as temporal logic
              and linear logic, applications of category theory to semantics, and
              non-standard set theories.  The Special Session on Hybrid Systems included an
              invited address and talks on special topics in hybrid systems.  NSF funds
              supported this session, which enabled the participation of the keynote and
              invited speakers, and enabled widened opportunity for participation and
              inclusion of graduate students.
