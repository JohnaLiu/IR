Abstract    :
              	This dissertation investigates how gender-based asylum policies have developed
              and been administered by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).  In
              1995 the INS created a category of gender-specific types of persecution. 
              Examples of gender-based persecution are rape, sexual abuse, genital
              mutilation, forced marriage, forced sterilization, and domestic violence.  The
              United States is one of only three nations to implement a 1991 United Nations
              call to recognize gender-based persecution.   The history and administration of
              this policy will be investigated by interviews with INS officials,
              administrative hearing officers, immigration attorneys, Non-Governmental
              Organizations (NGOs), human rights activists, and asylum seekers.  Observation
              of hearings and NGO meetings will also provide information on how the policy is
              being implemented.  In addition, archival materials such as INS and UN
              documents, attorney case files, and NGO reports will provide background
              information on the history of the policy and its administration.
