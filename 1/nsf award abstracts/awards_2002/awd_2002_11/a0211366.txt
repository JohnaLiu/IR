     The investigator uses mathematical models and analysis
              to
study the dynamics of several physiological systems in which
excitability
              is a common and fundamental feature.  The three broad
problem areas to be
              investigated are
     1) The initiation and dynamics of cardiac arrhythmias;

                  2) The dynamics of defibrillation;
     3) The dynamics of autoimmune
              disease.
The study of these problems involves the development and use
              of
sophisticated mathematical models and tools, including advanced
numerical
              methods such as immersed boundary methods, bifurcation
theory and dynamical
              systems theory, and asymptotic analysis.
These tools are used to give
              theoretical understanding to problems
of border zone and ischemia related
              cardiac arrhythmias, APD
instabilities and their relationship to the onset and
              development
of reentrant arrhythmias, mechanical alternans deriving
              from
instabilities of the calcium handling system or crossbridge
dynamics,
              the success or failure of defibrillation, and
oscillatory autoimmune
              responses.  Serious attention is given to
obtaining agreement between
              theoretical results and experimental
findings.  To that end collaborations
              with experimentalists
examine gap junction coupling of rabbit myocytes, the
              effect of
hypertrophy on excitation-contraction coupling through
              the
sodium-calcium exchanger, the effect of mutations on the
              delayed
rectifier potassium channel that lead to increased proclivity
for
              fatal arrhythmias, and the role of mimicry in oscillatory
dynamics of cystic
              fibrosis in mice.
     Excitability is one of the most important features
              enabling
signalling in physiological systems.  It is crucial to the
operation
              of nerves, muscle, the heart, the immune system, and
blood clotting as well as
              numerous gene regulatory networks.  The
specific goal of this project is to
              gain an improved theoretical
understanding of how the normal function of
              systems that rely on
excitability can go awry, exhibiting pathological
              behaviors, and
how these pathological behaviors might be controlled
              or
prevented.  The behaviors that are studied here are the result
              of
interwoven interactions of simpler behaviors, resulting in
complex
              behaviors that defy understanding through intuition or
simple means.  The
              investigation therefore focuses on the
development and analysis of
              mathematical models of these
behaviors in the belief that substantial new and
              important
insights can be gained, and new hypotheses formulated that are
not
              apparent from phenomenological descriptions.  While this
project has as its
              main focus several problems relating to
abnormalities of the cardiac cycle, it
              extends far beyond to many
areas of physiology where common principles are
              involved.  The
project includes a significant training component for
              students.
