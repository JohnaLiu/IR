This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project
              proposes to apply  cavity-enhanced spectroscopy to Capillary Electrophoresis
              (CE). CE typically relies on absorption spectroscopy to detect analytes eluting
              from a separation column. Although this detection method is very useful, the
              capillary's short absorption
pathlength has limited its sensitivity, forcing
              the development of more complex detection schemes. Preliminary results suggest
              that an optical cavity can be used to enhance this absorption sensitivity by a
              factor of hundred to over ten thousand. The aim of this proposal is to
              interface a CE column to an optical cavity and demonstrate the enhanced
              detection of various biological samples. Due to the increasing popularity of CE
              in biochemical research, the commercial applications of this technology
              continue to grow. It is currently used to analyze DNA fragments, proteins, and
              various drugs. Moreover, it is also being considered as an alternate to gel
              electrophoresis for DNA sequencing and is a leading prospect for lab-on-a-chip
              technologies. 

The commercial applications of this project are in genomic
              sequencing, medical diagnostics, and drug screening.
