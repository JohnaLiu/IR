Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Silver Buffalo Consulting, under the direction of
              Ms. Rose Von Thater-Braan, for the support of a workshop entitled, "Dialog on
              Diversity in Education: A Transcultural Learning Experience."  The Dialog on
              Diversity in Education will bring together Indigenous, Native American,
              scholars, educators, elders and language speakers and staff from various NSF
              Directorates in a shared inquiry on diversity. A goal of this dialog is to
              encourage the transformation of theory into practicce in developing culturally
              relevant educational environments that support and encourage Indian
              participation in science and engineering.
