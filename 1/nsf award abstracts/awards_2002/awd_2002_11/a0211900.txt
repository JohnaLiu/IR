Abstract    :
              Professor Neal Armstrong of the University of Arizona is funded by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to prepare and characterize ordered
              thin films of organic materials for electronic applications.  Interface-induced
              disorder in layers lowers carrier mobility and therefore could limit organic
              materials' use in molecular electronics.   The PI proposes to modify
              phthalocyanine-based discotic materials to facilitate polymerization and
              alignment by self-organization.  Two surface modifications will be used to
              enable the alignment:  chemically modified substrates and capillary channels. 
              The materials will be characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), including
              conductive tip AFM, and  photoemission spectroscopy.  

This technologically
              relevant class of organic materials has potential uses in electronic devices
              such as field effect transistors and photovoltaics.   Molecular electronics for
              miniaturization is one of the goals of nanotechnology.
