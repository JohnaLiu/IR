Abstract    :
              This study, to be conducted by a doctoral candidate of cultural anthropology at
              New York University, will examine the relationship between religiosity and
              emerging notions of citizenship among Mexicans in New York City.  It will
              investigate the ways in which members of this population challenge dominant
              notions of citizenship and translate devotional practices into political
              activism.  Specifically, this investigation examines Mexican immigrant
              involvement in non-profit organizations that have emerged from Catholic
              confraternities and subsequently converged into a citywide migrant association.
              The modes of social organization and discourses of participants in two
              parish-based confraternities and a city-wide non-profit umbrella organization
              are analyzed to test the hypothesis that members of these organizations are
              redefining rights, citizenship and identity by renegotiating the symbols of
              faith and nation, mobilizing the space of the church, and participating in
              activities normally reserved for citizens with typically material aims such as
              immigration rights, social services and political/economic equity.  This study
              will contribute to anthropological theories on religion and transnational
              citizenship, and to an understanding of immigrant integration generally and
              Mexican-American integration specifically.
