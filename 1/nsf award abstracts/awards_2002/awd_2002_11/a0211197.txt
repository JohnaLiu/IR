Indonesia is home to one of the largest Moslem
              populations in the world. This dissertation research by an anthropology and
              history student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, examines
              corporate-sponsored community development in the region surrounding a copper
              mine controlled by Newmont, a U.S. corporation in Sumbawa, Indonesia. The
              objectives of this research are to trace the political, economic and social
              transformations taking place due to the corporation's presence and development
              activities, and to investigate how social actors work out moral understandings
              of these transformations and allocate resources through kin relations and
              notions of development, corporate responsibility, Islam, and abstract rights.
              Methods include participant observation with corporate personnel and local
              Sumbawans, structured observation of corporate meetings with community leaders
              and other intermediaries, archival research, and structured household
              interviews.  The student will examine the relationship between development
              workers' and villagers' understandings of and support for four projects dealing
              with housing, farming, environmental rehabilitation, and health. The research
              will advance our understanding of traditional Moslem culture's relation to
              development, will shed light on a major phenomenon of global capitalism -
              corporate social responsibility, as well as contribute to the training of a
              young social scientist.
