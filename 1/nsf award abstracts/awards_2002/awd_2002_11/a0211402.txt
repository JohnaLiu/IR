Abstract    :
              A kinetic theory of the electron heat flux instability in low-beta solar coronal
              holes will be developed and its role in the heating and acceleration of the
              fast solar wind will be investigated.  A new paradigm is advanced, wherein the
              electron heat flux coming from the sun is produced by nanoflares and then
              generates ion cyclotron waves, which subsequently heat the overlying corona. 
              Thus the solar wind driven by ion cyclotron waves is directly coupled to the
              nanoflare activity.  A new wave damping mechanism, involving the parametric
              resonance of particles with a pump wave which drives a cross-field current
              instability, and the waves generated by the instability, will be modeled
              analytically and numerically.  Finally, a kinetic theory of ion heating in the
              fast solar wind as a result of this cross-field current instability will be
              investigated.
