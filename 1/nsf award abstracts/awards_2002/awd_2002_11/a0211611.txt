Abstract    :
              National Musical Arts is requesting a planning grant of $50,000 to conduct
              initial planning and research toward the development of a traveling exhibition
              and related educational programming on the subject of biomusic -- the musical
              sounds produced by living things.  The work will be performed by the BioMusic
              project, a program of National Musical Arts, in collaboration with the
              Association of Science Technology Centers and a national team of informal
              science educators.  The goal of the project is to develop a 2,500 square-foot
              traveling exhibit and related programs targeted to md-sized science centers,
              zoos and aquaria across the country.

During the proposed one-year planning
              phase, the Biomusic Project and ASTC will work with an interdisciplinary team
              of scientists, musicians, exhibit developers and educators to understand the
              current state of biomusic research; to identify concepts and phenomena that
              could make strong visitor experiences; and to develop initial plans for the
              exhibit and programs.  The result of the work of the planning phase will
              include a Biomusic Groundwork Report, a Biomusic Program presented at the
              annual ASTC Conference and a detailed Exhibition Prospectus.
