Abstract    :
                   The investigator aims to complete the nascent theory of
output-sensitive
              algorithms in real algebraic geometry.
Output-sensitive in this context means
              that the complexity of the
underlying algorithm depends mainly on intrinsic
              geometric
parameters, e.g., the number of connected components of
              the
underlying solution set, as opposed to extrinsic parameters like
the
              degrees of the input polynomials.  Such algorithms are faster
than the
              traditional methods of computational algebra by a factor
exponential in the
              dimension, but have so far been discovered
only in various isolated contexts. 
              So a unified algorithmic
approach has a broad impact.  Furthermore, the
              underlying
approach takes numerical conditioning into account from
              the
outset, thus providing algorithms that are certifiably precise
even when
              applied to approximate data.  Another novelty is that
the underlying theory
              applies in the even broader arena of real
and p-adic analytic functions.  The
              algorithmic aspects of p-adic
analytic functions are almost completely
              unexplored, so a
secondary focus of this project is to elaborate and apply
              this
new theory to equation-solving over finite fields and
              motivic
integration.
     The investigator combines advanced techniques from
              numerical
analysis and algebraic geometry to provide a new approach to
              a
fundamental problem occuring in many applications: solving
analytic
              inequalities.  For example, finding the optimal
allocation of resources in a
              large organization (e.g., an army,
an airline, or a large business) has long
              been known to reduce to
solving linear inequalities.  From a different
              direction, it is
known that the complexity of certain neural net
              architectures
(which are useful in training automated bomb-sniffers and
              pattern
recognition systems) depends critically on understanding
              the
solutions of nonlinear polynomial inequalities.  Both these
examples are
              special cases of analytic inequalities, and this
project provides new
              algorithms for their solution that are
magnitudes faster than current
              algorithms.  Furthermore, these
new algorithms provide certifiably precise
              solutions --- a
feature which is especially important when facing
              uncertain
physical data.  Another novel aspect is the
              principal
investigator's recent discovery that the underlying
              techniques
apply to an even broader context, which can provide new
              solutions
to many problems in the design of cryptosystems.
