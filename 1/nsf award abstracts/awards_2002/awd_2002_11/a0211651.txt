Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to develop a methodology for conferring
              regioselectivity in organic syntheses through specific binding of substrates to
              biological macromolecules. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, two
              projects with strong application potential will be undertaken. First, bovine
              serum albumin (BSA) will be used to guide the regioselective reduction of
              steroids. Second, a lectin (e.g., concanavalin A) will be used to guide the
              regioselective modification of disaccharides such as lactose and melibiose.
              These regioselectivities are based on the proteins' specific and unique binding
              properties. This new method may be useful in the development of new modified
              steroids and carbohydrates of commercial importance. Undergraduate students
              will be involved at all stages of this research in a team environment, from
              experimental design, synthesis, instrumental operation, to data collection and
              analysis. This not only trains them technical skills in biochemistry and
              organic chemistry, but also boosts their interest in pursuing research careers
              in these fields.
