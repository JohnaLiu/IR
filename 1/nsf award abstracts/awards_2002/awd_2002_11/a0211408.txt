Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project features as the
              main
goal, the development of a simulator of nanoscale electronic devices, and
              circuits.
Emphasis will be placed on devices and circuits that are based on
              carbon nanotubes, or
tunneling in lithographically defined junctions. The
              simulator will be based partly on
the extensive collection of theoretical and
              numerical techniques that have been developed by the firm to describe charge
              transport in single electron devices. A diagrammatic technique and
              non-interacting Green's functions were used to obtain the tunneling rates in
              such junctions. Those techniques will be extended to describe the nanotubes. A
              graphical user interface will be developed, as well as a module that provides
              movies of the dynamics of charge flow. A package that enables the visualization
              of charge transport in these ultrasmall devices is expected to be a stimulating
              teaching and learning tool. with the standard SPICE package.
     Powerful
              simulation tools are essential for the evaluation and development
              of
nanoelectronic devices and systems. The primary customers of the proposed
              nanosystems
simulator is expected to be chip manufacturers, manufacturers of
              high sensitivity electrical measuring instruments and academic researchers.
