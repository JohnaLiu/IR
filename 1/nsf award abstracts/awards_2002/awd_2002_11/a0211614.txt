     The goal of this project is to develop mathematical
              theory
regarding biodiversity in the context of resource competition.
Recent
              numerical work suggests that competition for multiple
resources can generate
              periodic oscillations or even chaotic
oscillations, and a large number of
              species can coexist on very
few limiting resources.  However, both
              mathematicians and
ecologists still lack analytic understanding of mechanisms
              that
generate diversity in ecological communities.  The investigator
studies
              several resource competition models, including standard
competition models
              with multiple resources and competition models
within food webs; he gives
              rigorous analysis for the models and
provides insight into diversity of
              competing species.  Theory of
differential equations and theory of dynamical
              systems are used
to determine the long-term behavior of solutions of the
              models in
the form of attracting steady states, limiting cycles or
              strange
attractors.  Important issues are what causes competing species
              to
coexist, and locating parameter ranges in which coexistence
occurs.
    
              The question of the maintenance of species diversity in
natural systems has
              intrigued mathematicians and ecologists for a
very long time.  This work
              provides a general understanding of
factors affecting abundance and
              biodiversity.  The results have
important implications for determining the
              patterns of species
composition in aquatic and terrestrial systems, and for
              managing
natural resources such as forests and lakes.
