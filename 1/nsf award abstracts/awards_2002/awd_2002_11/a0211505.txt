Abstract    :
                   The investigator studies systems with multiple interacting
components that
              together create rhythms.  The systems come from
neural, chemical, and gene
              regulatory contexts.  There are two
main themes.  The first is reduction of
              dimensions, investigating
the circumstances under which large-dimensional
              models behave
like much lower-dimensional differential equations or maps. 
              Some
of that work uses geometric singular perturbation theory to
investigate
              how systems with multiple degrees of freedom
"condense" to essentially
              lower-dimensional systems, at least
locally in phase space.  Another set of
              issues related to
reduction of dimension concerns fast partial
              synchronization.
The second theme concerns how interaction of many components
              in a
system can lead to the suppression of activity in some of
              the
components.  Two examples of this to be studied come from a
chemical
              pattern formation and neural systems, each with some
type of global inhibitory
              feedback.
     Systems with many separate but interacting components arise
in
              a large variety of applications, including biotechnology,
chemical
              engineering, and neurobiology.  In general, such systems
have a large number
              of degrees of freedom, and are usually
investigated by numerical simulation. 
              However, simulations alone
do not provide a deep understanding of why the
              systems behave the
way they do, or how they can be manipulated.  Reductions
              of
equations to smaller systems can be very useful.  But without a
principled
              way to do the reductions, one does not know how much
of the behavior of the
              large system is lost.  This project
concerns methods to find such principled
              reductions, using
mathematical tools that enable one to investigate
              circumstances
under which parts of the dynamics behave like that of
              systems
with a much smaller number of degrees of freedom.  Other tools to
be
              used allow one to understand how only some subset of the
components can be
              involved at a given time, even though all
components are coupled.  The methods
              are applied to problems from
neural, chemical and gene regulation systems. 
              The project also
provides interdisciplinary training opportunities for
              students
and postdocs.
