Abstract    :
              The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 were unprecedented in their scope
              and traumatic impact. For this reason, little is known about the variety of
              responses that can be expected among residents of the United States. As the
              effects of the trauma spread through the country, scientists and mental health
              professionals have little information to use in predicting adjustment over
              time. This project will provide such data. The research examines some of the
              psychological consequences of the terrorist attacks by continuing to follow and
              interview a sample of respondents who were initially questioned soon after
              September 11 and again in November, 2001. It is expected that information
              collected in this effort will illuminate coping processes so that future
              intervention efforts can be better informed, more cost-effective and more
              sensitive to the needs of the United States populace.
