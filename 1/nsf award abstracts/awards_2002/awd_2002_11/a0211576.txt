Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support of the Gordon Conference on the Science,
              which will be held at Tilton School (NH) during the period August 11-16, 2002. 
              This conference is held every two years in summer, which to the true spirit of
              Gordon Conference, creates a lively environment to bring up cutting edge ideas
              and iron out controversial issues pertaining to adhesion science.  The 2002
              conference will composed of nine sessions, with two to three speakers in each
              session.  In tune with the tradition of this conference, promising junior
              scientists have been invited along with established scientists from academia,
              government labs and industries as oral presenters and discussion leaders.  The
              conference will consist of 21 oral presentations that will deal with the
              interfacial, rheological and mechanics aspects of adhesion by highlighting the
              relevance of fundamental adhesion science in solving technologically important
              problems in coatings, structures, electronic, biological and MEMs devices. 
              

The organizers intend to invite more junior faculty members, graduate
              students and postdocs to participate in the conference by presenting their
              research results in the poster session that will run throughout the conference.
               In order to facilitate quality discussion quality  discussions attendance to
              the conference will be restricted to 120 attendees, aiming to attain broad
              representation across the diverse participants in the field of adhesion science
              and engineering.
