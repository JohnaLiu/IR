Abstract    :
              Professor Robert D. Grober of Yale University and Dr. James Cameron of Shipley
              Corporation are funded in this GOALI project by the Analytical and Surface
              Chemistry Program.  The work is focused on single molecule spectroscopy as a
              way of probing photoresists. The team is using pH-sensitive fluorescent dye
              molecules to probe photogenerated acids on the nanoscale in
              chemically-amplified photoresists.  Diffusion of acids and fluors through the
              resists will be measured, providing insight into the transport and kinetics of
              these systems. 

Single molecule spectroscopy is a relatively new laser
              method made possible in the past decade by extremely sensitive detectors.  It
              allows optical characterization of phenomena at the nanoscale.  It has not yet
              found much industrial use.   Precise control of the spatial distribution of
              photoacid during lithographic processing is paramount for maximizing
              lithographic resolution.  The results of the study are significant for
              nanotechnology and will be of benefit to the semiconducting industry.
