Abstract    :
              This dissertation project examines the relationship between the rights of
              citizenship and the politics of race in Britain between 1948 and 1968.  It will
              address three questions. First, how were the unstable boundaries between state
              and society demarcated along the lines of race after1945, when advocates of
              minority concerns increasingly defined civil rights in terms of the state's
              responsibility to prevent discrimination in the private sector? Second, how did
              members of both anti-racist organizations and the legal profession assess the
              efficacy of working within liberal and egalitarian framework to advance
              minority concerns?  Third, what criteria were employed to legally define
              classes of people deserving state protection against discrimination,
              particularly in the drafting and enactment of the Race Relations Acts of 1965
              and 1968?  To answer these questions, the Co-Principal Investigator will engage
              in archival research to examine the specific processes and debates through
              which egalitarian arguments and the codification of citizenship became linked
              most explicitly with the politics of race.
