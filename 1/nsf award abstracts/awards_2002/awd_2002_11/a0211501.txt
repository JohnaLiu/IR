Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the
              implementation of a Terahertz (THz) module that can emit coherent and tunable
              Terahertz waves. This project naturally follows the recent result obtained by
              the Project Investigator. Recently, coherent Terahertz radiation was generated
              at room temperature, which could be continuously tunable from 56.8 mm to beyond
              1618 mm (5.27 to 0.18 THz), in Gallium Selenide, based on difference-frequency
              generation. The peak Terahertz power can be as high as 69.4 W at 196 mm. The
              corresponding photon conversion efficiency reaches 3.3%. This value has been
              greatly improved owing to the combination of extremely low absorption
              coefficients in the Terahertz domain and a large second-order nonlinear
              coefficient for Gallium Selenide. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated
              that optical parametric oscillator in Lithium Niobate can be used to generate a
              Terahertz wave tunable in the range of 110-460 m (2.7-0.7 THz) with a peak
              power of 300 W. However, Lithium Niobate suffers from photorefractive damage.
              One needs a much higher laser intensity to achieve parametric oscillation.
              

The Terahertz source will dramatically impact molecular spectroscopy. Such
              an instrument can be eventually used to control pollution and to identify toxic
              chemicals, for remote sensing, bio- medical imaging, and security screening.
