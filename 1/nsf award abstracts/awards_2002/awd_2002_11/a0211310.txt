Abstract    :
              This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research by Professor Jack R. Norton in the Department of Chemistry at
              Columbia University to facilitate the synthesis and manufacture of compounds of
              interest to the pharmaceutical industry.  The rates at which zirconaziridine
              enantiomers interconvert will be measured and reactions of metallaaziridines
              with epoxides and aziridines will be developed.  In addition, the one-electron
              chemistry of alkyl complexes similar to those that serve as precursors for
              olefin polymerization catalysts will be investigated.  The electrochemistry of
              boranes and related alumoxanes will be explored in order to determine whether
              single-electron transfer is involved in catalyst activation by these compounds.
               The effects of small amounts of reducing agents on catalytic olefin
              polymerization will be determined.  

New reagents and methods will be
              developed to better understand and improve the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and
              polymers.
