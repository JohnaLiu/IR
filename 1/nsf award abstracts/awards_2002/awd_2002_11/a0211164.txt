Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to employ microemulsion-based protein extraction
              (MPE) systems for the rapid, selective, and scalable recovery and purification
              of proteins.  The research plan consists of first investigating the physical
              chemistry and hydrolysis kinetics of the mixed surfactant systems, to determine
              difference between this mixed surfactant system with comparable ionic/nonionic
              mixed systems, and to identify operating conditions for MPE.  In addition, the
              mixed surfactant system will be applied to the MPE of single- and multiple
              protein systems, the latter systems related to the fractionation of blood
              plasma proteins.  The success of MPE will be evaluated based on productivity
              (i.e., speed and protein capacity), selectivity, applicability to a wide-range
              of operating conditions and protein purification challenges, and
              non-inactivation of protein products.  Furthermore, pH-degradable ionic and
              bioaffinity water-in-oil microemulsions forming surfactants will be synthesized
              and employed.
