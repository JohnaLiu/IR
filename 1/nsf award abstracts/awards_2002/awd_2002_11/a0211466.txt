Abstract    :
              0211466   Swackhamer   The Gordon Research Conference on Environmental Sciences:
              Water will be held at the Holderness School in New Hampshire from June 23-28,
              2002. The primary objective of this conference is to present, discuss, and to
              kindle new research approaches and directions at the interfaces between
              chemistry, toxicology, and environmental engineering. The conference is unique
              in the field of environmental engineering, due to its informal and intimate
              setting, cutting- edge science, interdisciplinary nature, and small number of
              participants. This particular Conference has been a forum for the consideration
              of critical or even controversial ideas that have frequently led to the
              development of new research agendas. In general, the Conference has a long
              record of stimulating advanced research in industrial laboratories, colleges
              and universities, research foundations, and government laboratories, and
              establishing linkages amongst these communities of scientists and engineers.
              The conference consists of nine formal sessions having 2-3 speakers each, with
              discussions in each session led by a leading scientist/engineer in the field.
              Speakers include established experts as well as promising younger
              investigators, and are from the United States, Canada, and Europe. Several
              poster sessions are also offered to maximize exchange and interactions among
              participants. At the last session of the conference, two exceptional posters
              are selected and the authors are invited to give short oral summaries. Graduate
              student attendance and participation in the poster sessions is strongly
              encouraged. The session topics include: Bioavailability and Reactivity,
              Reaction Mechanisms, Heterogeneous Particles, Arsenic and Selenium Cycling,
              Mercury Cycling, Frontiers in Biogeochemistry, PAH Exposure and Effects,
              Emerging Contaminants of Concern, and Environmental Modeling. ***
