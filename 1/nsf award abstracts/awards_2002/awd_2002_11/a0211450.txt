Abstract    :
              0211450  Kney  The objective of the research is to investigate the combined
              effects of ion exchange and magnetic fields in the treatment of synthetic waste
              streams containing heavy metals.  Specifically, column chromatography will be
              used to examine the magnetic field effect on the kinetics and selectivity of
              selected ion exchange materials in electrolyte solutions containing multiple
              cations.  The electrolyte solutions will contain the five cations, lead (II),
              nickel (II), cadmium (II), copper (II), and zinc (II).  The effects of ion
              concentration, ion-exchange material, magnetic field intensity, and the method
              of magnetic exposure will be examined.  This research could provide information
              to advance the fields of water and wastewater treatment. ***
