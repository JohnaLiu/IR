Abstract    :
              It is proposed to carry out theoretical research on the solutocapillary driven
              convection in spherical shells.  The problem arises from the accurate
              manufacturing of laser targets in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) and future
              inertial fusion energy (IFE) targets.  To initate fusion, these targets must be
              very smooth, otherwise Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities may be triggered thus
              degrades the efficiency of fusion ignition.  It has been demonstrated that the
              bumpiness of the target surface is caused by Marangoni instabilities driven by
              surface tension dependence on the solute concentration during the manufacturing
              process.  Linear stability analysis will be used to establish the critical
              condition and to suggest initial conditions for nonlinear analysis.  The
              surface defortmation will be calculated by the nonlinear calculations.  Results
              of the calculations will be compared with the  experimental results obtained by
               General Atomics.
