     In this collaborative project the
              investigators combine
mechanistic modeling, computational analysis, and
              experimental
techniques of developmental genetics to analyze
              cell
communication networks in the development of the Drosophila
              egg
(oogenesis).  They focus on the patterning events mediated by
              the
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), during which a localized
source
              of the EGFR ligand is modulated in space and time by a
distributed network of
              autocrine loops to produce a biochemical
blueprint specifying the formation of
              a pair organ.  The
investigators develop mechanistic models of EGFR signaling
              in
Drosophila oogenesis.  These models are necessary to directly
              test
consistency of the proposed regulatory mechanisms, to make
              the
experimentally verifiable predictions, and to guide the design of
future
              experiments.  The models should explicitly account for the
key components of
              the EGFR system: the receptor, four of its
ligands, ligand processing
              proteins, and intracellular signaling
cascades.  The nonlinear
              reaction-transport models of spatially
distributed EGFR signaling networks are
              analyzed using a
combination of numerical simulations, asymptotic techniques,
              and
bifurcation analysis.  The tests of model-based predictions rely
on
              experimental advantages of Drosophila genetics.
     Signaling through the
              Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor EGFR
is essential in a number of
              developmental processes across
species, from fruitflies to humans, and is
              extensively studied at
the molecular level.  The main goal of the project is
              to develop
modeling and computational tools necessary to
              describe
reaction-transport processes in developing epithelial layers. 
              In
the context of Drosophila, the investigators aim to capture a
large number
              of phenotypic transitions in eggshell morphology
that have been observed
              following quantitative manipulations in
the doses of the regulatory genes. 
              This leads to a class of
mathematical problems that are also relevant in other
              biological
and physico-chemical settings.  Given the highly conserved
              nature
of EGFR systems, it is possible that the proposed analysis
              of
patterning events in Drosophila oogenesis may be used to
understand the
              role of EGFR in the formation of branched
epithelial structures in the
              development of higher organisms.  The
project has a significant educational
              component: it brings
together and trains students and postdocs in biology,
              engineering
and mathematics.
