Abstract    :
              Knowledge of tropical biota and ecosystems has expanded greatly in recent years.
              At the same time, the scope of tropical biology has also broadened to include
              social and economic dimensions of land use change and habitat loss. Tropical
              biologists have also started to make policy inputs to conservation and
              management of ecosystems. The Association for Tropical Biology (ATB), in
              collaboration with other organizations, has planned a process to articulate and
              prioritize research in tropical biology. The goals of the process are to review
              recent developments in tropical biology and to define priorities for future
              research. This workshop award will support participation of U.S. scientists,
              including graduate students, to attend a major international conference, the
              Annual Meeting of the ATB in Panama in July, 2002. This conference will be
              attended by natural and social scientists as well as policy makers. The
              participation of U.S. scientists will benefit U.S. scientists and those from
              tropical countries to promote scientific collaboration in the short- and
              long-term.
