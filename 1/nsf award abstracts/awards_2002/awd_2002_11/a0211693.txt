Abstract    :
              Professor Richard McCreery of Ohio State University is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study the structure and mechanisms
              of molecular tunneling junction systems.  Monomolecular films of a compound
              tethered to a graphite surface are probed as a mercury drop approaches the
              surface.  Raman spectroscopy is employed in an in-situ manner.  Molecules such
              as nitroazobenzene are utilized as adsorbates.  The mechanism of conduction and
              conductive switching of this system is being investigated.  How does the
              molecular structure of the organic layer affect the electronic properties of
              carbon based junctions?   

The work is relevant to the development of
              molecular electronics for applications such as high density data storage,
              molecular transistors, photodetectors, display technology and chemical sensors.
               Using molecules as electronic elements is a goal of nanotechnology.
