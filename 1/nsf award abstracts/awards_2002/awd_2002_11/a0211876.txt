Abstract    :
              Todd Martinez is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry
              Program to continue development and application of ab initio molecular
              dynamics, specifically the multiple spawning method.  Methodological
              improvements include addition of tunneling effects, extension to larger
              molecules, and expansion to coupled cluster electronic structure theory. 
              Specific application areas include the photodynamics and isomerization of
              butadiene, hexatriene, and stilbene, for direct comparison to ultrafast
              experiments.

The most fundamental and ubiquitous process in organic
              photochemistry is photoinduced isomerization of molecules.  This research can
              provide the detailed understanding of the electronic mechanism of this process
              that will be necessary in designing molecular optoelectronic devices.
