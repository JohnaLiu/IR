Abstract    :
              A natural language-based system will be built to answer queries based on a 200
              million-word body of literature consisting of all the articles from the ASM
              journals for the last five years. The study consists of proof-of-concept
              research, so it is experimental in nature. There are two ideas that are key to
              the analysis, which has the potential to revolutionize the use of electronic
              literature in biology. The first idea is that biology should be viewed as a
              collection of natural language structures, containers, which have a
              standardized form and occur with high frequency in the literature. The second
              idea is that there is a simple but systematic relation between questions that
              users ask and the data in the containers found in the text. This will allow the
              system to answer queries without deep analysis. New technologies, especially
              visualization tools, will be developed in a uniform environment using Java.
