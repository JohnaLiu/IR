A workshop on Feynman Integrals and related Topics will be held
              at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, California
              from December 9-12, 2002.  The workshop will coincide with the end of a program
              on quantum computing at MSRI in order to explore the possibility that the
              Feynman integral approach to quantum mechanics might be useful for quantum
              computing applications.  This award will partially support the travel and local
              expenses of young scientists, principally graduate students, postdoctoral
              researchers, who can then participate in the workshop.
