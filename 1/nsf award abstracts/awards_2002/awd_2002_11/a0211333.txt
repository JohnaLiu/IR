Abstract    :
              Each year over 1.5 million US students cross the boundary between elementary and
              middle school, a crucial developmental period when students are often permitted
              and encouraged to take greater responsibility for their choice of affiliations
              and activities. This dissertation research project by a cultural anthropology
              student studies what role family and peers play in students' formulation of
              agendas during this social transition. The student will follow a cohort of
              children during their first year of middle school in a peri-urban Atlanta
              community. Combining participant observation, a series of semi-structured
              interviews with a sample of 40 students and their parents, and a sequence of
              broad school-based surveys, the researcher will examine how students prioritize
              short-term agendas, how family and peer networks influence these agendas, and
              how students, by choosing who influences them, act as agents in their own
              socialization. This study will improve our understanding of how local networks
              of social relations serve as mediators of cultural influence and change. The
              new knowledge to be created will also be valuable for policymakers to
              understand how families and peers serve as informal sources of cultural
              education during the middle school transition.
