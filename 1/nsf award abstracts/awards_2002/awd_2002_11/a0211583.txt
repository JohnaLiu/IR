Abstract    :
              This award is to support research that will develop new and extend existing tree
              ring records from the North American Arctic treeline.  Since the northern limit
              of treeline coincides with the southern limit of the Arctic Front, this work
              will provide a spatial and temporal constraints on the Arctic Front over the
              last millennium.  
Field work will be undertaken to collect samples from
              northern Canada and Alaska.  Analyses will include cross-dating, ring width,
              and measurement of maximum latewood density.  All data will be standardized to
              maximize extraction of low frequency climatic variability.  Finally, tree-ring
              chronologies will be incorporated into dendroclimatic reconstructions of past
              temperature.
 
The broader impacts of this proposed research are that it will
              lead to information about the variation and nature of the forest tundra ecotone
              during a time of rapid environmental and climatic change.
