     The investigator and colleagues have been developing
              a
biologically constrained large-scale computational model of the
"front-end"
              of the cortical visual system -- the primary visual
cortex (V1).  To date,
              their work has focused upon local
properties of individual cells within the
              large-scale network --
properties such as orientation selectivity and simple
              vs complex
cellular dynamics.  In this project, they scale up to a
              more
global model of V1, reaching scales large enough to study
              some
elementary optical illusions of psychology and psychophysics.
This
              involves several square millimeters of lateral cortical
area, together with a
              multi-layered architecture -- with emphasis
given to cortical dynamics. 
              First, a "coarse-grained mixed
representation"  is derived mathematically and
              tested numerically
-- a representation that combines spatially
              coarse-grained
(local) mean firing rates, representing local background
              cortical
operating points, with an idealized representation of a
sub-network
              of individual point neurons embedded within this
background and retaining the
              detailed firing patterns of
individual neurons.  These two components interact
              with each
other -- with the coarse-grained local operating points
influencing
              the responses of the individual neurons, and vice
versa.  Second, the global
              mixed representation is used to study
specific dynamical phenomena in visual
              cortical processing: (i)
the layer-specific "dynamics of orientation
              selectivity" (as
measured by reverse time correlation methods); and later
              (ii)
"bistability in figure-ground assignments" (as detected in
psychology
              and psychophysics experiments).  In both cases, the
phenomena involve
              extensive lateral regions of V1, its layered
structure, and (likely in the
              case of figure-ground assignment)
other cortical regions.  And in both cases
              the work involves
close interaction with the experimental work of neural
              scientist
Robert Shapley.
     Today, through new biological experiments
              combined with the
power of modern scientific computation, scientists and
              applied
mathematicians are making significant strides toward
understanding
              the human brain.  Visual perception and the cortical
processing of visual
              information provide important starting
points.  By focusing upon the "front
              end" of the cortical visual
system, McLaughlin and his colleagues develop
              computational
models of the visual cortex that are strongly constrained
              by
biological experiments.  In this project the investigators
develop
              computationally efficient numerical methods that permit
scale-up of the models
              to global representations of the primary
visual cortex -- reaching cortical
              scales large enough to study
some elementary optical illusions of psychology. 
              This work
requires the direct interaction of applied
              mathematicians,
computational scientists, and neural scientists -- and
              involves
theoretical, computational, and experimental components.
