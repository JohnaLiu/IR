Abstract    :
                   The investigators consider a general system of nonlinear
nonlocal
              hyperbolic equations describing the dynamics of several
interacting
              populations.  The goal of the project is to develop
theories on the
              existence-uniqueness, long-time behavior, and
numerical approximation of
              solutions to the hyperbolic system.  A
combination of analytical and numerical
              methods is used to
understand the dynamics of the complex proposed model.  To
              study
existence and uniqueness of solutions to this system, two
              major
approaches are adopted.  The first approach to study the
well-posedness
              of solutions is via the finite difference method
used for classical
              conservation laws.  The second approach to
investigate the well-posedness and
              long-time behavior of
solutions is based on the monotone approximation and
              comparison
results that have been successfully established for the
semilinear
              case by the investigators.  Although similar approaches
have been used in
              studying other nonlinear partial differential
equation models, their
              applications to special cases of the
general nonlinear and nonlocal model
              considered in this project
have only been carried out by the investigators. 
              In addition, a
numerical methodology is developed for an inverse
              problem
governed by the proposed nonlinear nonlocal system of equations.
It
              uses a connection between real data and the model to estimate
unknown
              parameters.  Meanwhile, a numerical package is developed
for simulating the
              proposed model.
     Many populations and their interactions with the
              environment
have been modeled using the structured population approach,
              where
the structures of interest are induced by internal
characteristics such
              as age or size.  For example, size-structured
population models with
              distributed rates have been successfully
used to describe the dynamics of
              mosquitofish in California rice
fields.  The structured population approach
              has also been used to
model the dynamics of hierarchically structured
              populations in
which the differences between individuals have a direct effect
              on
the availability of resources.  Another application is the
predator-prey
              interaction between zooplankton and phytoplankton
within the context of algal
              aggregation.  Generally speaking, in
order to analyze, manage, and control the
              dynamics of a
population, it is necessary to understand the
              interactions
between the population evolution and its environment.  In
              this
project, the investigators study a general structured population
model. 
              Due to its complexity, a combination of analytical and
numerical methods is
              developed to investigate the dynamics of
such a population.  In particular, a
              numerical package to simulate
the proposed model is provided.  Furthermore,
              certain techniques
are introduced to estimate the growth and mortality
              for
individuals within the population from field data.  Because of
              the
generality of the proposed model, the results help to answer
questions
              about nonlinear phenomena in population dynamics.  In
addition, the resulting
              numerical method can be used by
population biologists to investigate the
              dynamical behavior of
general population models.
