Abstract    :
              In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Bowen will use negative ion photoelectron spectroscopy to
              investigate the stabilization of otherwise unstable anions by solvation and by
              counter ions, gas-phase double Rydberg anions, 
excess electron states in
              clusters including dipole-bound cluster anions and cluster analogs, and
              bio-molecular anions and their complexes.

This project deals with several
              issues of contemporary physical chemistry, which impact on related fields and
              on biochemistry.  The work will provide molecular level description of
              important condensed phase phenomena, including those in biological entities. 
              The work will be assisted by graduate and undergraduate students and by
              postdoctoral research associates.  In an active outreach program the work is
              also presented to middle school students to give them a feel of ongoing
              forefront scientific research.
