Abstract    :
              Individuals typically choose to mate with others of the same species by using
              several genetically based behavioral or chemical cues.  The investigators seek
              to identify the parts of the genome that are associated with these behaviors
              and chemicals to test various evolutionary hypotheses of species formation. 
              They propose to execute this research in populations of the fruit fly species
              Drosophila mojavensis, a member of the cactus-yeast-Drosophila model system,
              because of its association with and infestation of cactus rots.  Previous
              studies in this and other Drosophila species have shown that olfactory cues
              (pheromones) and auditory cues (courtship wing vibrations) are the cues that
              individuals use to select mates.  The investigators will use DNA-based markers
              to identify the locations of genes influencing these traits.  This approach
              will ensure that these genetic analyses will be performed on individuals reared
              on their natural host plants, as recent studies have shown a dramatic effect of
              rearing substrates on these traits.

The results of this research will begin
              to reveal the number and locations of genes that are responsible for the
              beginnings of species formation.  Thus, this work will provide insights into
              the fundamental evolutionary processes that regulate biodiversity on Earth.
