Abstract    :
              The proposal seeks to disseminate the Systemic Initiatives  (SI) study results
              via hosting two distinctive activities: an Invitational SI Workshop and an SI
              Study Forum.  The SI Invitational Workshop of urban school data managers,
              internal evaluators, and project directors as well as selected urban study
              members will be held March 14 - 16, 2002 in Orlando, Florida. The proposed SI
              Study Forum website will further disseminate results of more than 30 studies
              supported by the National Science Foundation. The website will be ongoing past
              the end of the grant period.

The proposed work is to be funded by The
              Division of Educational System Reform (ESR) in collaboration with the Division
              of Research, Evaluation and Communication REC).
