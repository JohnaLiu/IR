Title: Symposium: Recent advances and new directions in mechanics,
              continuum thermodynamics, and kinetic theory

ABSTRACT

A symposium
              entitled

   Recent Advances and New Directions in Mechanics, Continuum
              Thermodynamics, and Kinetic Theory

will be held at Virginia Polytechnic
              Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, in conjunction with the 14th
              U.S. National Congress on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, June 23-28, 2002. 
              The symposium will focus on current problems in three areas: rational
              mechanics, continuum thermodynamics, and kinetic theory, as they are practiced
              today in the spirit of the late Clifford Truesdell. The objectives of the
              symposium are

   (1) highlight recent advances in the three topic areas;


                (2) provide the opportunity for communication and collaboration between
              senior and junior investigators;

   (3) educate young researchers and
              advanced graduate students and expose them to the forefronts of current
              research; and
 
   (4) shape new directions of research among investigators
              who value an emphasis on foundations, structure, and logical
              implications.

The "Journal of Elasticity and the Physical Science of Solids"
              has dedicated a special volume to the papers of the symposium.  The publication
              of a hard-cover book is also planned.  Details about the symposium can be found
              on the web at http://www.ms.uky.edu/~mcsxyh/ctsymp.htm.
