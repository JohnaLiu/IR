Abstract    :
              The International Conference on Questionnaire Development, Evaluation, and
              Testing Methods (QDET) will be held in Charleston, South Carolina from November
              14-17, 2002.  The conference is the ninth international conference in a series
              devoted to survey methodology.  The QDET conference will foster scientific
              research and critical commentary on questionnaire evaluation methods that can
              lead to improved methods, better understanding of the error properties of
              survey questions, and improvements in survey measurements.  The conference will
              also serve to document and communicate recent advances in the field and
              increase their use by survey practitioners, in the U.S. and abroad.  There will
              be 22 invited papers and approximately 65 contributed papers with presenters
              coming from Italy, Finland, New Zealand, Sweden, Israel, France, Germany,
              Canada, Slovenia, the Netherlands, and the United States.

An edited volume
              of 22 invited papers is expected to be published by John Wiley & Sons.  It will
              be advantageous to the survey research field to have a single volume that
              includes contributions from those researchers who have been instrumental in
              developing, applying and/or evaluating the new questionnaire development and
              evaluation techniques.  This volume will be valuable in university settings to
              train future survey methodologists and survey practitioners and in
              organizational settings to provide a reference volume that describes and
              provides guidance on current best practices in questionnaire development,
              evaluation, and testing.
