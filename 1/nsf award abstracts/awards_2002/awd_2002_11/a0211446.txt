Topology, which grew from Geometry, is the
              study of shapes and their
behavior under deformation, and of limits. It is an
              important field in its
own right and has applications in other fields of
              Mathematics, and also in
a wide range of other sciences including Computer
              Science, Chemistry,
Physics and Biology.
     The Summer Conference on
              Topology and its Applications was first held
in New York in 1984; it has been
              held each summer since then, except 1986.
For most of its existence this
              series of conferences has been an important
part of the international
              topological landscape. Most of the participants
have been Americans, but an
              increasing number come from across the world.
Until 1994, all these
              conferences were held in the United States, but to
encourage and support
              worldwide participation, that year the Conference
was held in Amsterdam, and
              it has since been held in Mexico City and North
Bay (Ontario); about half of
              the future Summer Conferences are expected to
be held in the United States.
              The holding of the conference in the
southern hemisphere for the first time,
              in New Zealand, recognises the
topological strength of that country. It is
              also expected that this will
lead to increased participation in the conference
              series by topologists
from south-east Asia and Australia.
     This year the
              conference will be held at the University of Auckland,
New Zealand, July 1 to
              4. More details about the conference may be found
