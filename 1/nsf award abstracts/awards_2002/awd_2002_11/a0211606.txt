Abstract    :
              This workshop proposal addresses data management research for the semantic web.
              Semantic web is mainly about technology for machine understandable and machine
              readable web pages. To date, much of the research on the semantic web has
              focussed on developing ontologies and languages such as the Resource
              Description Framework. There is a lot of research that needs to be done on
              querying and indexing the web pages. The participants of this workshop will be
              those who are actively conducting research in data management and the semantic
              web from academia and industrial research laboratories. The workshop will
              include short presentations by the experts as well as extensive discussions on
              research directions and challenges. The outcome of this workshop will be a list
              of recommendations for further research on data management support for the
              semantic web.
