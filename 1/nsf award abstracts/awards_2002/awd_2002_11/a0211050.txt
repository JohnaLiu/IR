Abstract    :
              The proposal is for a Minority Research Planning Grant to initiate an
              investigation to apply heat exchanger design principles to improve fuel cell
              design practices.  Topics to be pursued include the allocation of electroactive
              area over which charge transport occurs, the use of "cathode fins" to reduce
              charge transfer resistance, thermodynamic optimization via a modern Second Law
              analysis of the fuel cell transport processes, and the application of
              thermoeconomics analysis for cost-effective cell stack design. The planning
              grant should serve to guide the PI in the development of more extensive
              research proposals in this technically important area.  The research activity
              will be coupled to an existing educational outreach program that will help to
              promote science and engineering graduate education to underrepresented minority
              students.
