Abstract    :
              0211625  Parlange  The purpose of the research is to address questions on the
              particle transport from the World Trade Center (WTC) Site through the
              deployment of state-of-the-art instrumentation to measure the emission and
              resuspension of particles into the atmosphere It is planned to conduct the
              study over a ten-day intensive field  observation period at the WTC site and
              the surrounding region of the greater New York City area to measure the flux of
              particles from the site and the vertical and horizontal extent of the aerosol
              plume. 
At the site, a combination of turbulence sensors, including Particle
              Image Velocimetry (PIV), Holographic PIV and sonic anemometers mounted on a
              telescopic profiling tower to continually measure the shear stress and the
              concentration and flux profiles of p[articles from the surface up to 10 m.
              above the site.
A scanning elastic lidar system will be deployed to measure at
              high resolution (1.5 m.) the relative concentration of particles in the lower
              atmosphere (range up to 7 km.).  The lidar will be deployed both near the site
              and at sites to be identified in the greater NYC area.
The lidar system will
              be calibrated using the concentration measurements obtained from the PIV
              systems.
An analysis of the field data collected will be conducted to identify
              relationships between weather conditions (e.g., wind shear stress, sensible
              heat flux) and the magnitude of the surface flux of particles and the extent of
              the transport into the atmosphere. ***
