Abstract    :
              This recommendation memo provides support and justification for funding of
              IIS-0211679.  The proposal requests support for convening a workshop to explore
              possibilities for collaborative research and demonstration projects involving
              libraries as access and service providers for Internet2 applications.  Workshop
              participants will include experts in advanced networking, librarians from the
              academic, and public sectors and international experts in the area.  The goal
              will be to collect perspectives, examine feasible alternatives and produce an
              action plan for deploying advanced networking and digital services through
              libraries and other community access providers.
