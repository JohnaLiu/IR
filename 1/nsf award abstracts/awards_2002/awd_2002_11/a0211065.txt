Abstract    :
              The objective of this research by Professor Terrence J. Collins at
              Carnegie-Mellon University, which is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic
              and Oganometallic Chemistry Program, is to develop tetraamidomacrocyclic
              iron(III) complexes (TAML activators) in conjunction with hydrogen peroxide to
              destroy chemical and biological warfare agents on contaminated surfaces.  These
              agents include organophosphorous ester nerve gases such as, such as Sarin and
              VX, mustard (alkylating) compounds and biological agents including bacteria,
              virus, and toxins.  

This Small Grant for Exploratory Research supports the
              development of a widely-applicable decontaminating process to eliminate various
              chemical and biological warfare agents including viruses and bacteria, such as
              anthrax, that have been or may be used in terrorism.
