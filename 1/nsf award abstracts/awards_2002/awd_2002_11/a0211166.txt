Abstract    :
              This grant supports theoretical research aimed at calculating and understanding
              the physical properties of strongly interacting, many-electron materials. 
              Numerical,  as well as phenomenological analytic calculations for basic models
              such as the Heisenberg, Hubbard, t-J, and the electron-phonon Holstein model
              are proposed.  The goal of this research is to understand the properties of
              specific systems.  In particular, what type of order or competing orders, such
              as antiferromagnetism, charge density wave, superconductivity, stripe domain
              wall formation, or hidden topological order with quantum number
              fractionalization does a given system exhibit.  In addition, what are the basic
              mechanisms responsible for these phenomena and what limits the energy scales or
              temperatures, where these various orders appear.  

This group is one of the
              world leaders in computational studies of strongly interacting many-body
              physics.

This grant supports theoretical research aimed at calculating
              and understanding the physical properties of strongly interacting,
              many-electron materials.  The problems addressed are at the forefront of of the
              field and the numerical methods used are state-of-the-art.  The PI has also
              been very successful working with students and postdoctoral associates.
