Abstract    :
              With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor
              John E. Baldwin, of the Department of Chemistry at Syracuse University, is
              studying isomerization reactions of isotopically labeled hydrocarbons.
              Professor Baldwin is establishing the relative importance of one-center and
              two-center epimerizations in spiropentanes and cyclopropanes and obtaining the
              first experimental measures of secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on
              these stereomutations. In addition, he is exploring a number of other
              fundamental hydrocarbon isomerizations, including the conversion of
              cyclopropane to propylene via 1-propylidene, [1,3]-carbon shifts,
              [1,5]-hydrogen shifts, interconversion of bicyclo[5.1.0]octa-2,4-dienes via
              intermediate bicyclo[4.1.1]octa-2,4-dienes, and "carbo-Claisen"
              rearrangements.

Thermal reactions of small hydrocarbon molecules play key
              roles both in fundamental organic reaction chemistry and in large-scale
              petrochemical processes such as hydrocarbon reforming. Professor John E.
              Baldwin, of the Department of Chemistry at Syracuse University, is studying the
              thermal transformations of a variety of small molecules. By incorporating
              stable isotopes, Professor Baldwin is able to obtain a comprehensive view of
              these transformations, obtaining insights into the reaction mechanisms which
              will ultimately lead to a fundamental understanding of how thermal reactions
              characteristic of simple organic chemicals occur.
