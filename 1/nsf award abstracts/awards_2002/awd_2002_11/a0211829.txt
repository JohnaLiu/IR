Abstract    :
              The NSF-EC workshop in Grenoble entitled Workshop on Tools and Instrumentation
              for Nanoscale Research and Manufacturing is one of four joint events between
              the NSF and the European Commission (EC) held in 2002. The emphasis in this
              workshop is on tools and instrumentation for nanoscale research and
              manufacturing. The workshop will explore the synergy between instrumentation
              for nanoscale research, and its role in the areas of advanced materials and
              manufacturing in the U.S. and Europe.  Information about the workshops are on 
              http://www.nsf.gov/home/crssprgm/nano/start.htm. In addition,  two of the other
              workshops in this series are The Puerto Rico Workshop on Nanomanufacturing and
              Processing, which is on the web at
              http://www1.eng.iastate.edu/nsf2002/nsf-ec.html and The Workshop on Societal
              and Educational Impacts of Nanotechnology which is posted at
              http://www.nsf.gov/home/crssprgm/nano/start.htm.

Materials research is
              a huge driving force for innovations that serve to educate and train future
              scientists and engineers, while advancing economic growth and social progress.
              Frontier areas of nanoscience and technology are generating scientific
              breakthroughs that revolutionize existing technologies as well a create new
              ones in areas that include health and medical services, transportation,
              environmental protection, energy efficiency, civil infrastructure, information
              technology, and homeland security.
