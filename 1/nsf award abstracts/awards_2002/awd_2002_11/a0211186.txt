This three-year award for cooperative research on the
              invasive alga, Codium fragile ssp. Tomentosoides, involves field surveys and
              experiments at Lough Hyne, Ireland, the Channel Islands, the English Channel
              Coast and Atlantic French Coast.  Cynthia D. Trowbridge of Oregon State
              University, Colin Little of Bristol University, William F. Farnham of
              University of Portsmouth, and Alan Critchley of Degussa, Texturan Systems
              Research Centre, will conduct research on ecological mechanisms inhibiting or
              facilitating invasion of Codium fragile.  This macroalga is a widely
              distributed temperate seaweed that has spread across geographic regions and
              international boundaries.

The investigators propose to conduct field surveys
              of invaded regions and field experiments testing causal mechanisms.  They will
              document community attributes of the French and English shores to determine
              whether the invasive agla establishes itself primarily in disturbed
              communities.  In the intertidal community of Lough Hyne, they will explore
              inhibiting and facilitating mechanisms, such as high cover of intertidal
              seaweed, high densities of fauna grazers, and low nutrient levels. The U.S.
              investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in the genus C. fragile and
              marine zoology.  This is complemented by Dr. Farnham's expertise on introduced
              macroalgae, Dr. Critchley's expertise macroalgae biology, and Dr. Little's
              experience in intertidal communities.  Insights into causes and conditions
              conducive to seaweed invasions could prevent future spread and impact coastal
              management practice.
