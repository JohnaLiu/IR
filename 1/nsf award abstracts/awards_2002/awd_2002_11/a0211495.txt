Abstract    :
              The proposed research focuses on developing a  better understanding of the
              nature of  the  active  sites  on  sulfated-  and  tungstated  zirconias  for 
              the  isomerization  of  
light n-alkanes  (n-butane, n-pentane,  and
              n-hexane). To date, zirconia-based catalysts have offered more potential for
              utilization than  has  been  able  to  be  realized,  in  large  part  due  to 
              their  tendency  towards  fast deactivation. The reaction induction period,
              lasting only a few minutes for n-butane isomerization, largely determines the
              future behavior of sulfated zirconia.   The proposed research will make use of
              an in-situ  reaction  technique,  isotopic  transient  kinetic  analysis 
              (ITKA),  to  determine  the evolution of the concentration and residence
              time(s) of the surface reaction intermediates during the initial reaction
              period.  Addition of trace amounts of olefins (1-butene, 1-pentene,  and 
              1-hexene)  during  initial  reaction  will  help  to  define  the  nature  of 
              the active sites, and in particular "olefin-modified" sites that have recently
              been identified.  In-situ  DRIFTS  as  well  as  other  more  traditional 
              ex-situ techniques will be used to characterize  adsorbed species and the 
              catalysts studied.  The educational component will be the traditional mentoring
              of graduate and undergraduate students.  A better understanding of  the
              similarities  and  differences  of  the  sites  on  these  catalysts  for  the 
              isomerization  of  the different n-alkanes may guide the design of more stable
              catalysts. Processes built around the use of such  solid  acid  catalysts 
              offer  possibilities  for  replacing  less  environmentally friendly processes
              with liquid acids or solid acid catalysts requiring the co-feed of corrosive
              compounds.
