Abstract    :
              This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research by Russell P Hughes, Department of Chemistry, Dartmouth
              College, in fluorocarbon bond activation by transition metals. Hughes is
              developing novel catalytic routes to convert chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and
              perfluorocarbons (PFCs) to hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Aliphatic C-F bonds in
              fluoroalkyl groups bonded to a cationic iridium center undergo facile reaction
              with hydrogen gas under ambient conditions, resulting in the substitution of a
              C-H bond for the C-F bond. The fluoroalkyl groups may also react with methane
              to make a new carbon-carbon bond. By further study, the scope of these
              important reactions will be expanded to new substrates and catalysts.
              

Perfluorocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons are industrially important
              chemicals used as refrigerants, foaming agents and solvents. However these
              compounds also are implicated in ozone depletion and global warming.
              Hydrofluorocarbons have many of the same useful properties, yet are more
              environmentally friendly. This research may lead to new useful HFCs as well as
              provide a new way to deactivate and recycle PFCs and CFCs.
