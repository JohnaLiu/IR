Abstract    :
              Understanding of the dynamics of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system, the
              coupling between the two regions, and its dependence on interplanetary
              conditions in particular, is of fundamental importance to almost every aspect
              of magnetospheric and ionospheric physics. In this project, electric and
              magnetic field and precipitating particle data from polar orbiting satellites
              such as DMSP F12, F13, F14 and F15, are used while the Polar UVI instrument
              provides measurements of auroral emissions. The SuperDARN radar array provides
              ionospheric convection maps. Ace, Wind, and IMP-8 provide solar wind velocity,
              density and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) measurements. Time periods are
              utilized when Polar UVI provides a global view of the auroral distribution and
              at least two DMSP satellites measure particle properties, electric fields, and
              field-aligned currents in the upper ionosphere. Utilizing these data the
              understanding will be improved of the occurrence of trans-polar arcs (TPAs) and
              theta aurora in both hemispheres and the detailed plasma flows associated with
              them. In particular, the existence of high latitude TPAs is one of the most
              unusual features seen in the ionosphere and implies an unusual magnetospheric
              topology. The electrodynamics of TPAs is directly related to how coupling
              occurs between the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system during northward
              IMF. Analysis of the unique data set described will provide insight into
              simultaneous behavior and/or existence of TPA in both hemispheres and thus also
              into the topology of the magnetosphere.
