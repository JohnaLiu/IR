Abstract    :
              The Educational Broadcasting Corporation (WNET) is researching and testing an
              experimental, short-format television broadcast and Web project entitled
              "Science InSight."  The goal of this experimental research is to determine if
              short-format television segments can successfully increase Americans'
              understanding of -- and interest in -- new research in science and technology
              and, if they can, which of several possible formats is likely to be most
              successful.  During this research and development phase, WNET will test the
              viability of the project model and develop and refine the model for use in a
              selected group of media venues such as the forthcoming PBS weekly public
              affairs program,"Public Square."  The specific activities to be undertaken in
              the research phase include:

-assembling an expert board of up to six
              advisors with expertise in science, science journalism and media;

-producing
              three, experimental, short-format, "program concept" video segments of varying
              lengths for use as science information pieces in other media
              programs;

-conducting formal and informal testing and evaluation of these
              test formats for appeal, credibility, clarity and comprehensibility of style
              and content; and 

-identifying additional key potential distribution
              partners from television media, print, Web and science centers outlets.
