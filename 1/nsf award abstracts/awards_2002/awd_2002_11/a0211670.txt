A major research program is proposed, with the goal of
              understanding in detail how shoot apical meristems of plants control their
              patterns and numbers of cell divisions.  Two sets of genetic experiments are
              proposed, each with its own aims.  The first set includes careful analyses of
              cell type and cell divisions in mutant and wild type shoot apical meristems
              (SAMs), and time course analysis of the dynamic changes induced in SAMs by
              changes in expression of the genes that control meristem behavior.  Among these
              genes are CLAVATA1, CLAVATA3, WUSCHEL, and SHOOT MERISTEMLESS.  These
              experiments should result in a newly detailed view of cell division and cell
              differentiation control in meristems, and will provide a toolkit for detailed
              analysis of new mutant phenotypes and new gene functions.  The second set of
              experiments are developmental-genetic analyses of newly discovered meristem
              control genes such as HANABA TARANU and KANADI4, and mutagenic screens of types
              not used so far with plants, to find more meristem control genes.  These
              experiments will fill in some of the missing players in meristem control, and
              will lead directly to new hypotheses of cellular communication and behavior in
              meristems.  The overall result is expected to be a newly detailed and dynamic
              description of meristem cell activity, and following from this, and from
              genetic analysis of the genes that control meristem behavior, a new functional
              understanding of shoot apical meristems, and thus of plant growth and
              development.
