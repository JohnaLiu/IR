There is a new and growing effort to understand complex
              systems and 
complexity that has stimulated widespread interest in the
              scientific 
community. This grant will enable the participation of students,
              
postdoctoral fellows and and other junior scientists in the 
International
              Conference on Complex Systems (ICCS). Sessions will 
focus on unified
              conceptual and mathematical strategies and their
applications to physical,
              biological and social systems. The 
conference includes pedagogical sessions
              for students and topics of 
interest and concern to the public that will serve
              as vehicles of 
education and communication for a broader audience. A special
              
topical day will address recent advances in the study of evolution
and
              several sessions will focus on biocomplexity, ecology and
multiscale patterns
              coupling biological, physical and social systems.
Various conferences and
              workshops have addressed aspects of these 
growing efforts to understand
              complex systems. However, the ICCS 
is the only major international conference
              series to bring the wide 
diversity of research together, demonstrating the
              interdisciplinary 
yet integrative and coherent nature of these efforts. This
              conference 
series is organized by the New England Complex Systems Institute
              
(NECSI).
