Abstract    :
              This dissertation research by an anthropology student will study how
              professional identity is established and negotiated by clinical bioethicists in
              medical settings in the US and Canada. Using methods of participant
              observation, structured and informal interviews, the student will study
              bioethicists at a teaching hospital in Houston Texas, members of the National
              Rural Bioethics Project in Missoula Montana, the Joint Centre for Bioethics at
              the University of Toronto, Canada, and in rural teaching hospitals in Regina
              and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. The student will test hypotheses dealing
              with differences in the roles of knowledge, skills, and character in
              credentialing professionals in the US and Canada; the different role of
              stakeholders and resource managers in the credentialing process in the two
              countries; the contextual and interpersonal nature of authority negotiation of
              these non-medical specialists in medical settings; and the multiple roles
              bioethicists will play in resolving problems of daily practice. In addition to
              contributing to the training of a young social scientist, this research will
              advance our understanding of how the ethical dimensions of medical care are
              worked out in real life, and how non-medical authorities gain legitimacy when
              they act as patient advocates in a medical setting.
