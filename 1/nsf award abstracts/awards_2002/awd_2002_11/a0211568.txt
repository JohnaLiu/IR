Abstract    :
              This project will incorporate a sophisticated aerosol model within an existing
              general circulation model (GCM) with the goal of improving the ability of GCMs
              to predict the indirect effects of aerosols on climate change. The aerosol
              model will include size-resolved representation of all major aerosol types
              (sulfate, sea salt, carbonaceous, and mineral aerosols) and their microphysics.
              The model will be "nudged" towards NCEP reanalysis of meteorological fields.
              Model results will be compared with data from field campaigns, such as ACE-2
              (Aerosol Characterization Experiment). The broader impacts of this project will
              be to help reduce discrepancies between current global aerosol model
              predictions and observations. This grant will provide for the training of a
              graduate student.
