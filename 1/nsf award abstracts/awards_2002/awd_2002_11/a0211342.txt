Abstract    :
              RConflicts over natural resources and land allocation issues are intensifying
              worldwide.  Such conflicts present obstacles to both environmental conservation
              efforts and to political stability.  In the Hawaiian Archipelago, conflicts
              over the use and management of wetland areas have reached an all-time high. 
              While decades of agricultural, commercial, and residential development have
              threatened critical wetlands, biologists have found that endangered waterbirds
              are attracted to wetland areas that have traditionally been farmed for taro. 
              The co-investigator, an environmental anthropology doctoral student from the
              University of Washington, will work with 52 taro farmers on the Hawaiian Island
              of Kaua'i, investigating the connection between taro farming and endangered
              waterbirds.  The research focuses specifically on the economics of taro
              farming, the value of taro farming as a wetlands management alternative, and
              the value of environmental knowledge developed over generations by taro
              farmers.  The research will involve household interviews, weekly data
              collection on farm statistics and waterbird counts, a traditional environmental
              knowledge survey, focus group discussions, and participant observation.  These
              research methods are designed to document traditional environmental knowledge
              employed in watershed management and the economic profitability of taro
              farming.  This will provide an estimate of the per-unit cost for taro farmers
              managing wetlands for endangered waterbird protection.  If taro farming is
              indeed as environmentally valuable as is claimed, it may provide the state of
              Hawaii, and other regions throughout the moist tropics, with a means of
              promoting both human and environmental well-being.
