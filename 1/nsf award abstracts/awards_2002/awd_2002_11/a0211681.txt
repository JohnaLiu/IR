Abstract    :
              This grant supports the 2002 Physical Metallurgy Gordon Research Conference
              (GRC), to be held July 21-26, 2002, at Holderness School in Plymouth, NH. The
              primary goal of this conference is to bring together new and established
              researchers to generate an understanding of the most important emerging
              research directions related to the role of interfaces in physical metallurgy.
              Like most Gordon Conferences, the Physical Metallurgy GRC assembles a 80 - 100
              scientists and engineers for five days in a casual setting that is isolated
              from outside distractions with ample time for discussion and interaction. The
              conference will consist of eight sessions with two or three speakers per
              session. One session is reserved for late-breaking topics and posters. The
              speakers and chairs represent a diverse group of experts from leading
              institutions around the world. All of the NSF funds are used to pay for
              registration and travel expenses for graduate students and post-doctoral
              researchers to attend the conference. 

The last few years have seen an
              explosion of new experimental and simulation techniques that provide novel
              atomic-scale resolution descriptions of interfaces, quantification of
              microstructure, and observation of interfacial phenomena heretofore unknown.
              Perhaps most exciting are recent developments that have led to materials
              processing to achieve desired distributions of interfaces and to exploit unique
              interfacial characteristics to synthesize materials designed to match
              particular property profiles. The 2002 Physical Metallurgy GRC examines the
              latest advances in this multidisciplinary field within the context of selected
              research presentations and ample open discussion.
