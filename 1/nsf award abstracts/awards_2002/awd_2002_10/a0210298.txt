This proposal was received in response to the Nanoscale Science
              and Engineering Initiative, NSF 01-157, category NIRT.

This project targets
              the synthesis of nanoscale functional materials and their potential for
              applications in medical and biological areas. The research team has been
              assembled to develop methods for fabrication of useful composite materials
              based on principles of self-assembly and includes researchers in chemistry,
              physics, engineering, biomaterials, and pharmacology. The nano-encapsulation
              method to be elaborated involves the formation of a colloidal core with defined
              composition and size, and the preparation of an outer shell providing the
              required stability, permeability, compatibility, release of core material, and
              catalytic or affinity properties.
