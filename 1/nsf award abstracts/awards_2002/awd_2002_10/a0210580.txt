Abstract    :
              This four-year Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team (NIRT) project at the
              University of Florida with ProfessorCharles R. Martin as principal
              investigator, conducts a broad-based and systematic investigation of the
              development of smart nanotubes that are bioengineered and tailor-designed so as
              to accomplish specific biomedical/biochemical functions.  Silica asn polymeric
              nanotubes will be extensively used in this research effort.  Functionalized
              biodegradable and biocompatible poly( (lactide) nanotubes will be prepared. 
              The objective of the research program include: (1) to show that the chemical
              microenvironment within biochemically-functionalized nanotubes can be
              fine-tuned so as promote specific desired biochemical processes; (2) to show
              that such nanotubes can be capped via self-assembly chemistry with nanoparticle
              caps; (3) to demonstrate that these nanoparticle caps can be attached via
              chemical bond that dissociate when a specific intercellular chemical signal is
              detected; (4) to show that  such nanotubes can be tagged on their outer
              surfaces with antibodies that recognize specific cell types; and (5) to prove
              that all of these concepts can be used in concert to design new nanotube-based
              DNA transfection vechicles that deliver genetic material to specific desired
              cell types.
