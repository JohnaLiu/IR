Abstract    :
              This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering
              Initiative, NSF 01-157, category NIRT.  Our interdisciplinary team is
              investigating a new process for nanoscale machining employing field emission of
              electrons from carbon nanotubes.  High-precision nanomachining will be obtained
              by the concentrated thermal power transmitted by electron beams to a thin-film
              workpiece.  In order to investigate the nanomachining process, we will develop
              a staggered probe that integrates multiple carbon nanotubes on a single probe
              for integrated nanometrology by scanning probe microscopy and nanomachining by
              field emission.  Such probes will enable the experimental demonstration and
              investigation of nanomachining with field emission from nanotubes.

This
              research will demonstrate a new high-precision manufacturing process for
              producing nano-scale patterns that will impact many disciplines such as
              nanoelectronics, nanoscience, biology, and energy.  The research will foster a
              multi-university, interdisciplinary partnership in the areas of precision
              manufacturing, nanoscale thermal sciences, solid-state physics, and material
              science. A broad set of educational and outreach activities will include
              nanotechnology
workshops chemistry and pre-engineering students at Kentucky
              State University (KSU) and a summer microscopy fellowship for KSU minority
              students at the University of Kentucky's microscopy facility.
