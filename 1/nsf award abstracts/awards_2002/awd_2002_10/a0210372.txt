Abstract    :
              This Nanoscale Exploratory Research (NER) award to University of Texas Austin is
              supported by Divisions of Chemistry (MPS) and Chemical Transport Systems (ENG),
              and this proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation "Nanoscale
              Science and Engineering" (NSF 01-157).  With this award, Professors Krische and
              Anslyn will design and synthesize a family of oligomers to serve as synthetic
              programmable codons to mimic the templating by DNA to embody information
              storage properties.  Oligomers with programmable codons will be synthesized
              using different chemistries such as: neopentyl amino alcohol-linked to
              amino-dichlorotriazines; guanidinium-phosphates; guanidinium-carboxylates; and
              dihydrophalazine diones-diaminophthalazins.   These oligomers with dye-labeled
              strands will be evaluated for self-assembly and templating binding affinities
              using NMR dilution experiments, isothermal titration calorimetry, vapor
              pressure osmometry and cross-hybridization by thin layer chromatography. 
              Training and research of undergraduate and graduate students in this
              interdisciplinary program in physical and synthetic organic chemistry are
              integral parts of the project.  

A group of oligomers with dye-labeled
              groups and with "programmable" ultra high-affinity/specificity building blocks
              in nanoscale will be designed and synthesized to serve as "codons" with
              information storage capabilities mimicking some of the properties of DNA. These
              oligomers will enable surface-patterning schemes wherein multiple,
              predetermined optical constellations representing "memory-bits" are generated
              via spontaneous self-assembly. Owing to the interdisciplinary nature of this
              project, the proposed program of research will facilitate education and
              training of both graduate and undergraduate students in fields ranging from
              organic chemistry to molecular recognition and materials patterning.
