The objective of the research is to investigate the
              feasibility and limitations of Bacillus anthracis decontamination processes
              which utilize the physical disinfectants ultraviolet (UV) and gamma (g)
              irradiation.  The specific tasks of this exploratory research include: (1) the
              development of a database of the behavior for B. anthracis spores in response
              to UV and g irradiation, noting the spore inactivation, repair, and mutation,
              (2) the development of systems to quantify dose delivery in decontamination
              systems based on physical disinfectants using Bacillus cereus as a surrogate
              for B. anthracis spores, and (3) examination of spore inactivation in
              continuous applications to surfaces and aqueous liquids over a range of
              operating conditions, together with dosimetric data.  The use of B. cereus as a
              surrogate is logical and useful, since B. cereus is virtually indistinguishable
              from B. anthracis in terms of physiology and responses to disinfectants, but is
              essentially non-pathogenic to humans.  As a check of the validity of the use of
              B. cereus, a limited number of experiments will be performed with the Sterne
              strain of B. anthracis (the vaccine strain of the organism) to verify the
              results of the research.
