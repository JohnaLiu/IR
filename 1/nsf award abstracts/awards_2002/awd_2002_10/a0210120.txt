Abstract    :
              This four-year Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team (NIRT) project at
              Washington University, with Professor William E. Buhro as principal
              investigator, pursues a new  family of one-dimensional nanostructures form
              elemental boron and metal-borides.  These nanomaterials are expected to posses
              mechanical strengths, chemical and thermal stabilities, and electrical
              (metallic) conductivities comparable to or even surpassing those of carbon
              nanotubes.  Boron and metal-boride nanostructures will be ideal candidates for
              nanoscale electrical interconnects and semi-conducting components in
              nanoelectronic and nano-electrochemical devices.  Synthetic methods to be
              employed include catalyzed chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and plasma
              techniques.  Mechanical properties of nanotubes and nanowhiskers will be
              measured on mechanical-testing stages of scanning transmission electron
              microscope.  Electrical-transport properties will be studied using the
              nanoelectronic-testing stage developed at Washington University.
