Abstract    :
              This award will support an international conference organized by the American
              Quaternary Association (AMQUA) in Anchorage, Alaska on August 5-7, 2002
              entitled "Paleoclimate, Environmental Change, and Human Migrations in the North
              Pacific Basin." The purpose of the conference is to bring together
              international experts, practitioners, and students to share the latest
              developments in North Pacific paleoclimatology.

Specifically, funds will
              provide an undergraduate assistant to help with organizational logistics,
              travel support for 15 students who will present posters on their research
              projects, and travel support for 7 experienced professionals who will be
              invited to provide presentations that synthesize the latest research in their
              area of expertise.

The scientific themes of the various conference sessions
              are compatible and relevant to research projects supported by the Paleoclimate
              Program and include Late Holocene high-resolution climate studies, Quaternary
              paleoecology, and paleoclimatic teleconnections between high and low latitudes.
              

A final report synthesizing and summarizing the conference findings will be
              posted on public websites for reading by the wider scientific community.
