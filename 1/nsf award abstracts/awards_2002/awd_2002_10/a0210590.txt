Abstract    :
              This four-year Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team (NIRT) project at Duke
              University, with Professor Robert L. Clark as principal investigator, addresses
              both scientific and engineering aspects of nanopatterning of surfaces and
              in-situ nanofabrication that will directly impact biotechnology, biologically
              inspired engineering, transducers and electronics at nanoscale. 
              Instrumentation based on scanning probe lithography and dip-pen lithography
              will be developed for use in specially designed nanolithography.  New
              fabrication methods will be developed for nanometer length structures with
              biomolecules and stimulus-responsive macromolecules.
