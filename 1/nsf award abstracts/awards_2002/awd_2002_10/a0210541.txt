Abstract    :
              Behavioral analysis of a group decision-making process
Thomas D. Seeley
One of
              the most spectacular examples of an animal group functioning as a collective
              decision-making agent is a swarm of honeybees choosing its future home.  This
              phenomenon occurs in the late spring and early summer when a colony outgrows
              its hive and proceeds to divide itself by swarming.  The swarm bees leave en
              masse, quickly forming a cloud of bees just outside the parental hive;  they
              then coalesce into a beard-like cluster on a nearby tree branch where they
              choose their future dwelling place.  The nest-site selection process starts
              with several hundred scout bees flying from the swarm cluster to search for
              tree cavities that meet the bees' real-estate preferences.  The scouts then
              return to the cluster, report their findings by means of waggle dances, and
              work together to decide which one of the dozen or more possible nest sites that
              they have discovered should be the swarm's new home.
The PI will determine (1)
              how the scouts in a honey bee swarm work together to make the decision
              regarding their future nest site, and (2) how they sense when they have
              finished making this decision.  Such group decision making, or social choice,
              occurs in many species of group-living animals.  Unraveling the mechanisms of
              social choice is essential to understanding how animal groups function and may
              even lead to novel methods of social choice by humans.  A swarm of honey bees
              choosing its nest site is a striking and accessible form of social choice by
              animals.
