Abstract    :
              This Nanoscale Exploratory Research (NER) award to Illinois Institute of
              Technology is supported by Divisions of Chemistry (MPS) and Chemical Transport
              Systems (ENG), and this proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation
              "Nanoscale Science and Engineering" (NSF 01-157).  With this award, Professor
              Khan in collaboration with Drs. Chris Marshall (Argonne National Laboratory)
              and Robert Doedens (Univ. California Irvine) will design and develop novel
              nanostructured zeolite like materials based on nanometer-sized transition metal
              oxide clusters. Porous nanocomposites will be prepared from clusters of
              polyoxometalates such as polyoxovanadate and their derivatives with linker
              groups such as pyrazine, 1,4-dicyanobenzene and related organic ligands. The
              composites prepared will be characterized by a number of physicochemical
              techniques including spectroscopy (infrared, UV-visible, and x-ray absorption
              spectroscopy), single crystal structure analysis, thermal methods, and surface
              area measurements. Detoxification of oxides of nitrogen will also be carried
              out using the catalysts prepared.  Training undergraduate and graduate students
              in this interdisciplinary program is part of the project.  

Zeolite-type
              porous catalytic materials based on transition metal oxides will be synthesized
              and characterized for the eventual application in the detoxification of oxides
              of nitrogen.  These nanocomposite catalysts will be based on nanometer sized
              clusters of polyoxometalates and their derivatives linked by organic ligands. 
              With this award, both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in
              this interdisciplinary research program.
