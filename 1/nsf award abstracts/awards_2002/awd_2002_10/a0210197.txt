Recent work in physics, chemistry, and
              materials science has
produced nanometer-scale structures out of exotic
              materials using
sophisticated fabrication techniques.  However, very little
              work has
been conducted in computer engineering to investigate how to
              build
full-scale computer systems out of these new devices.

The goal of
              this exploratory project is to begin to develop new
techniques for
              constructing finite state machines (FSMs) out of
molecular nanodevices.  FSMs
              are one of the fundamental building
blocks of any digital computing system. 
              In this project, we
introduce NanoBoxes as a possible abstraction for
              constructing
reliable finite state machines for use in molecular
              computer
systems.

The reliability and error characteristics of molecular
              nanodevices
are substantially different from the corresponding
              characteristics
of traditional silicon-based CMOS transistors.  These
              nanodevice
characteristics present new challenges to computer designers
              which
will require an entirely new approach for designing finite
              state
machines.  The techniques we develop eventually could be used to
build
              entire computer systems out of molecular nanodevices.

This is a
              high-risk/high-reward project.  The risk is that we need
to develop new
              approaches for designing computers out of a large
collection of devices which
              are still under development themselves.
By observing common trends in newly
              developed molecular devices, we
make assumptions about their weak drive
              capabilities and their
unstable nature.  While we expect that we can adapt and
              extend
traditional space, time, and information redundancy techniques
              for
fault-tolerance into this new domain of molecular computers, new
ideas
              will be necessary to develop appropriate solutions.

This project is
              high-reward, however, since by conducting computer
architecture research in
              tandem with research on the nanodevices
themselves, we will be streamlining
              the development process to be
able to have fully-functional molecular
              computers more quickly than
if we wait for the nanodevice research to
              solidify.  Furthermore,
while we are tailoring our techniques for molecular
              nanodevices, our
techniques also will be applicable to error detection and
              correction
in quantum nanodevices and in nanometer-scale conventional
              CMOS
devices, which are becoming more fault-prone as transistor
              sizes
shrink.

This project will make substantial contributions to
              educational and
human resource development.  It will initiate the
              dissertation
research of a Ph.D. student in electrical and computer
              engineering
to focus their research in this new area.  We also expect to
              involve
a few M.S. students in this work and possibly provide
              research
opportunities for undergraduate students through existing
              internship
programs at the University of Minnesota.
