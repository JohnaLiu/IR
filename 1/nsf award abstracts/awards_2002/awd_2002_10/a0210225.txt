Exploring the Computational Limits Imposed by
              Nanotechnologies
John E. Savage


This project has four goals: a) to
              develop realistic models for chips with
nanometer-size dimensions, b) to
              explore the computational limits that apply
under the physical constraints
              imposed by nanotechnologies, c) to develop
architectures and algorithms
              reflecting these constraints, and d) to
incorporate the knowledge acquired in
              advanced and early graduate instruction.

While computational
              nanotechnologies exist only in the most primitive forms
today, we have an
              opportunity to influence their use akin to that which arose
when the VLSI
              model was developed in the late 1970s.  In this model gates are
so small that
              the area of wires is significant.  Efficient use of this
technology required
              new algorithms whose efficacy was demonstrated through the
development of new
              complexity-theoretic lower bounds involving chip area and
computation
              time.

Our approach will be a) to model technologies such as orthogonal
              arrays
(crossbars) of nanowires and nanotubes and masses of nearly
              uniform
self-assembled elements, b) to extend existing VLSI theory by
              incorporating
the new constraints that emerge, c) to explore new architectures
              that cope
with the complexity-theoretic constraints exhibited by the proposed
              highly
regular architectures and ways of programming them, and d) to devise
              lectures
and/or courses to bring nanocomputation to the attention of
              students.
