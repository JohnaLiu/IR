"NER: Computing
              Architectures for Coupled Nanomagnets"


We explore the feasibility of
              developing computing architectures
implemented in magnetically-coupled arrays
              of nanometer-sized dots and
pillars. Similar to the electronic Quantum-Dot
              Cellular Automata (QCA)
scheme, which was previously developed by the Notre
              Dame group,
information is encoded in the magnetization of
              single-domain
permanent-magnet structures, and the physical interaction
              between
neighboring magnets provides the local connectivity. The main goal
              of
this project is to investigate how logic functions can be realized
              in
structured arrays of coupled nanomagnets. We propose a joint
              theoretical
and experimental approach to explore the feasibility of such
              magnetic
QCA-like architectures for computing and signal processing.
              Once
feasibility of elementary logic functions is established, one
              may
envision special-purpose cellular processor cells composed of
              coupled
nanoscale magnetic sensors and memories. The robustness of such
              magnetic
systems opens the potential for applications where nanometer-sized,
              yet
rugged, systems are required with a wide range of
              operating
temperatures.
