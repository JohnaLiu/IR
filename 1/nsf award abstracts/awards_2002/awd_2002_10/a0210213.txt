A grant available through the Instrumentation and
              Facilities program of NSF's Division of Earth Sciences will allow Ohio
              University's Department of Geological Sciences to acquire rock and mineral
              sample preparation equipment and to upgrade existing petrographic laboratory
              facilities.  These facilities are to be used for both instructional and
              research proposes in an effort to efficiently characterize and prepare samples
              prior to, and with the purpose of, geochemical and isotopic analyses.  Students
              and faculty alike will benefit from the technology upgrade.  Projects that take
              advantage of these facilities reflect understanding active geologic processes
              and how ancient examples are preserved in the rock record in order to advance
              our geological understanding of planet earth.
