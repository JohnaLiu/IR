Abstract    :
              

Bioelectronic interfacing of living cells via self-assembled
              microwires


	We propose to develop a new method for creating bioelectronic
              circuits that will allow targeting and electrically interfacing specific
              molecules on the membrane of living cells, incorporating the cells into larger
              electrical circuits. This method is based on a new technique reported recently
              by one of the PIs (Science, 294, 1082, 2001) that allows the assembly of long,
              electrically conductive microwires directly from suspensions of metallic
              nanoparticles. The microwires are assembled via dielectrophoresis, the particle
              mobility and interactions in alternating electric field. We will devise
              techniques for controlled growth of microwires in thin chambers and
              microfluidic channels, and will develop experimental and theoretical tools for
              cell and wire manipulation in the electrical field leading to cell interfacing.
              
	Bioelectronic interfacing is one of the promising, yet underdeveloped, areas
              of nanoscience research. The success of this project could lead to development
              of new sensors, where the response of living cells to different toxins,
              biological or chemical agents is detected with greater precision and
              sensitivity. It can also help in developing tools for in situ interfacing of
              cells in living tissues (such as neurons). Current techniques either let the
              cells sit on top of electrode arrays or impale them via microelectrodes. In
              contrast, we will complete the connection between the cells and the electrical
              circuits via nanoparticle self-assembly, a potentially much more flexible and
              powerful approach.
