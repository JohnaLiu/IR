Abstract    :
              This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF 01-157.  The project focuses
              on the development of a new approach to structured atomic deposition and
              lithography.   Lithography using neutral atom beams focused by standing wave
              light fields shows great promise for nanoscale fabrication.  However, the
              method has so far been limited to the production of spatially periodic
              patterns, which greatly limits the versatility of the technique.  In this new
              approach a new method of synthesizing light induced lenses which permit the
              creation of a single localized spot at an arbitrary position in the plane will
              be used.  The spot can be scanned without mechanical motion using spatial light
              modulators, such that arbitrary two-dimensional patterns can be generated.  The
              project is jointly funded by the Divisions of Physics and Materials Research in
              the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.
