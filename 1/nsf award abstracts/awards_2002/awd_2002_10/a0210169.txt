Abstract    :
              This collaborative proposal offers a multiyear build-up  designed to increase
              the number of graduates for Federal employment at Mississippi State and Jackson
              State Universities.  At MSU we will extend information assurance (IA) course
              offerings outside the current Computer Science and Electrical and Computer
              Engineering student base to other departments and students across campus.  We
              will initiate this scholarship program during the first year at MSU and extend
              it to JSU, located approximately 120 miles from the MSU main campus, in the
              second year.   We will offer a joint security course of study electronically
              between the two institutions during the second year of the program. The program
              coordinator at JSU will participate in the MSU scholarship selection process
              during year 1. During the succeeding years, those students enrolled in the
              security course from JSU will also be entitled to scholarship consideration.
