Abstract    :
              A new theoretical model of resonant cyclotron interaction of ions with Alfven
              waves in the divergent solar wind plasma will be constructed.  It is based on a
              scale separation between the characteristic scales of wave-particle interaction
              (microscopic scale) and the scales of nonhomogeneity (macroscopic scale).  The
              latter is five to six orders of magnitude larger than the former.  The
              overarching goal of the study is to explain recent observations of the solar
              wind which have revealed that (1) the bulk speed of the particles considerably
              exceeds that of the protons, (2) the differential motion of the ions is aligned
              along the magnetic field, and (3) the differential speed follows the local
              Alfven speed.
