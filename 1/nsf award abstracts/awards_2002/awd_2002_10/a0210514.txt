Abstract    :
              This project develops the graduate level education and research program in
              information assurance at Polytechnic University by building on an NSF DUE CCLI
              project for establishment of an undergraduate laboratory in information systems
              security.  The principal long term goals of this project are to assist in
              meeting the national demand for a cadre of professionals with expertise in
              information assurance; to create prototype curricular material in graduate
              information assurance education that will serve as a widely adopted national
              model; and to establish an information assurance laboratory that becomes a
              national model for an experimentation environment providing hands-on
              experiences in topics related to information assurance.

Activities include:
              revising existing graduate level courses in information assurance to
              incorporate hands-on practical laboratory based experiences that supplement the
              theory and principles currently being taught in the classroom; developing new
              graduate level courses that complement the existing courses and result in a
              comprehensive curriculum in information assurance; establishing a laboratory
              consisting of heterogeneous platforms and multiple interconnected networks to
              facilitate hands-on experimentation and project work in issues related to
              information assurance; and developing a graduate level certication program in
              information assurance that focuses both on principles and practice needed to
              build and maintain a secure information systems infrastructure.  The project
              also includes a detailed evaluation and dissemination plan.
