The objective of this proposal is to examine a novel method for
              production of large amount of ultra fine particles having controlled surface
              chemistry.    A novel method to achieve the controlled surface chemistry is
              based on nanocoating using atomic layer deposition.   The proposed work is to
              examine the fluidization behavior of ultrafine spherical silica particles to
              avoid coating aggregates rather than individual particles
