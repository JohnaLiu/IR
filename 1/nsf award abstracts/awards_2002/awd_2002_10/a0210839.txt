Abstract    :
              0210839  Nanny  This proposal was received in response to the Nanoscale Science
              and Engineering Initiative NSF 01-157, category NIRT.  The project will
              identify key physical, chemical and biological conditions at the nano-scale
              that govern the bioavailability of aromatic hydrocarbons associated with NOM
              isolated from soils, sediments, and landfills.  After NOM characterization and
              quantitation, the impact of the localized molecular scale interactions, %
              hydrocarbon residue, and activation energy of interactions will be assessed
              with respect to bioavailability.  Naphthalene dioxygenase activity will be
              characterized as a function of NOM type and concentration and NOM-aromatic
              aging.  Coupling to microbial bioavailability will be made using
              bioluminescence reporting.  An outcome from the research will be the
              development of NMR based characterizations that will correlate with an
              enzymatic assay and a microbial bioassay.
