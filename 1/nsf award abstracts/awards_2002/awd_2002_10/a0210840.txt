By placing a single functional molecule at the tip of an atomic
              force microscopy, it will become possible to study the inter- and
              intramolecular interactions of single molecules by force spectroscopy in a wide
              range of chemical and biological systems.  The goal of the project is to
              provide the preliminary information for preparation of many forms of AFMS with
              single molecule tips.
