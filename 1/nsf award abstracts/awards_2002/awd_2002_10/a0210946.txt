This award supports a collaborative research project between
              Professor Mary Bisson of SUNY-Buffalo and Professors Mary Beilby and Norman
              Walker of the University of New South Wales, Australia.  Research on osmotic
              regulation in the marine alga Venticaria will focus on measuring potassium ion
              fluxes during osmotic stress, and on the effect of light, inhibitors and
              changing ion concentrations on flux rates.  Dr. Bisson's expertise in working
              with turgor probes and with cultures of Ventricaria will be complemented by the
              experience of her Australian colleagues in the use of ion-selective electrodes
              to determine potassium ion fluxes and in the mathematical analysis of
              current-voltage curves.

This study will provide baseline information about
              the generation and control of membrane potential in a typical marine algae,
              enhancing our knowledge of marine algae in general and providing valuable
              information for mariculture systems.  In addition, the project will strengthen
              the collaboration between the U.S. and Australian laboratories.
