Nanochannel FETs and Quantum Dot based
              Nonvolatile Memory Cells using 
Site-Specific and Layer-by-Layer Self-Assembly
              Techniques

Summary

This proposal aims at forming nanochannels (10-30 nm
              length with ~100nm 
width), using SiOx-Si nanomasks deposited via
              site-specific self-assembly, 
to fabricate FETs with enhanced performance.  In
              addition, it seeks to 
develop quantum dot based nonvolatile memory cell
              structures in floating 
gate and floating trap configurations. These
              nonvolatile memory cells are 
proposed to be grown using layer-by-layer
              self-assembly of ZnS-cladded CdSe 
or ZnCdSe quantum dots (with core diameter
              ~3-5nm).  The final goal is the 
integration of FETs with nonvolatile memory
              cells to design programmable 
circuits.
