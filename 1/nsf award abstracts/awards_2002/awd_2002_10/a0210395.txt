Abstract    :
              This Nanoscale Exploratory Research (NER) award to Virginia Polytechnic
              Institute is supported by Divisions of Chemistry (MPS) and Electrical and
              Communications Systems (ENG), and this proposal was submitted in response to
              the solicitation "Nanoscale Science and Engineering" (NSF 01-157).  With this
              award, Professor Yee will design and synthesize single molecule magnets based
              on radical ion bridged transition-metal networks from vanadium
              tetracyanoethylene complexes in solvents, and these compounds function at
              critical temperatures from 100K to room temperatures.  Single molecule magnets
              are well-defined spin-containing molecules that exhibit slow relaxation when
              they are spin aligned by external magnetic fields, and as such they have
              potential capacity for storage of information at near the theoretical minimum
              size limit.  Multidentate ligands, such as cyclopentadienyl, 
              hydrotris(pyrazoyl)borate, triazacyclononane or tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine and
              their derivatives will be used to block three or more coordination sites to
              construct monodisperse high spin molecular squares and  boxes and related
              structures.  Other ligand candidates, such as 7,7,8,8-
              tetracyanoquinodimethane, that are known to serve in a bridging capacity, but
              do not mediate in magnetic coupling reactions with vanadium carbonyls, will
              also be evaluated to determine the bridging capacity and magnetic coupling.
              

This award is for the rational synthesis of families of nanoscopic single
              molecule magnets, which have potential applications in information storage at
              near the theoretical minimum size limit. Because of the interdisciplinary
              nature of this project, the proposed research activities will provide education
              and research opportunities to both graduate and undergraduate students in
              fields ranging from organic and material chemistry to molecular magnetism.
