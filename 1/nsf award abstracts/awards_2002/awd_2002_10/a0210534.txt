Traditional methods of particle classification such as
              ultrasonic sieves and cyclones do not operate in the submicron range.  The PI
              proposes deelopment of a novel method for particle size classification in the
              nanoscale range.  The method is based on simultaneous application of pulsed and
              continuous DC electric fields on charged metallic particles in non-acqueous
              suspensions.  In this setup, continuous DC fields are applied in the vertical
              direction, while pulsed DC field is applied in the horizontal direction. 
              because of the difference in the electrophoretic response of charged particles
              to pulsed and continuous fields, the particle velocity field will be dependent
              on the particle size.  This principle is used to classify submicron size
              particles.
