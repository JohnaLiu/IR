Abstract    :
              This proposal was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering
              initiative, NSF 01-157, category NER.  Nanoparticle-supported (10-100 nm in
              diameter) catalysts that can be removed by the application of a magnetic force
              will be developed.  The magnetic capability of the nanoparticles provides a way
              for simple and efficient recovery of the catalysts by using a magnetic field.
              The required features of magnetic nanoparticles for use as effective catalyst
              supports include chemical inertness, weak inter-particle interaction, large
              magnetic permeability, high saturation magnetization, and flexibility for
              surface chemical modification. Spinel ferrite nanoparticles offer an excellent
              platform for design and control of magnetic properties to satisfy these
              criteria. These materials derive their unique magnetic properties from their
              nanoscopic size, which prevents the formation of multiple domains within a
              nanoparticle, allowing each nanoparticle to behave like a single paramagnetic
              atom with a giant magnetic moment. Furthermore, it is possible to control the
              magnetic properties of these materials by adjusting their composition at the
              atomic level. Therefore, it is possible to tailor the magnetic properties of
              the nanoparticles for specific applications. Each nanoparticle will have a thin
              silica coat, which is functionalizable and chemically inert. If successful,
              this research would lay the groundwork for an entirely new class of highly
              active polymerization catalysts that could allow for the recovery and reuse of
              these organometallic catalysts.
