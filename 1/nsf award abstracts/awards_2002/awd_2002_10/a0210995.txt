Abstract    :
              The 24th Midwest Probability Colloquium will be held at Northwestern University,
              on October 18-19, 2002. This is a regional meeting with a limited number of
              talks and plenty of opportunity for interaction among the researchers. It has a
              strong tradition of encouraging graduate students and other young investigators
              to attend and interact with specialists.
