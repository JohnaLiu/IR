A
              method for removal of nanoscale particles based on pulsed laser particle
              removal technology is being proposed.  The novelty of the method is based on
              the removal process based on rotation and removal of the particle instead of
              the translation and removal.  It is well established that removal through
              particle rotation would require a fraction of the force compared to removal by
              axial force.  The PI proposes to develop a fundamental understanding for
              modeling the dry removal process of nanoparticles with pulsed lasers, to study
              the potential damage mechanisms and to determine techniques for avoiding damage
              in required fluences, to perform experiments to improve and confirm analytical
              models, and to determine a parameter space for an efficient, practical dry
              cleaning technique.
