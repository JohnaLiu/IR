Abstract    :
              Carnegie Mellon University is developing an intensive faculty development and
              capacity building program in the critical area of Information Assurance (IA).
              

The goals of the program are: 
Help build new capacity or expand existing
              capacity to offer IA courses and programs at institutions not currently
              designated as Centers of Academic Excellence by
 -Enabling participating
              faculty members from non-CAE institutions to develop/expand their knowledge and
              expertise in the area of Information Assurance
- Providing the opportunity for
              participants to develop the curriculum and course materials to return to their
              home institutions and teach an introductory, upper-level, undergraduate course
              in Information Assurance
- Enabling participants to integrate security topic
              and issues into courses already offered.
Expand the number of PhD-level
              researchers in the IA area by
- Enabling participants to identify links
              between their current areas of research and IA
- Provide expert guidance and
              mentoring to help participants begin research projects in IA that are related
              to their areas of expertise and active research.

Carnegie Mellon is a
              partner with three institutions serving underrepresented minorities, and the
              first cohort to go through the program is comprised eight faculty members from
              Howard University, Morgan State University (both HBCUs), and the University of
              Texas at El Paso (an HSI). This program results in the creation or expansion of
              IA programs at these three institutions, and thereby significantly increase the
              national capacity for research and education in IA. It also enables partnering
              institutions to increase participation of underrepresented minorities in this
              critical area.
