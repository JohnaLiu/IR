Abstract    :
              This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF 01-157.  The research team
              will develop a broadly applicable conceptual framework to describe how tension
              on a DNA polymer can produce both the "tuning" and "switching" phenomena
              observed in DNA polymerase motors. This work entails developing theoretical
              models for the interaction of external forces with the conformational dynamics
              of the motor. It is also necessary to understand how molecular anisotropy in
              combination with the energy from a non-equilibrium chemical reaction biases
              Brownian fluctuations to drive the motor in a preferred direction. Like any
              nanoscale device, Brownian motors derive great benefit by working with rather
              than against thermal noise.

In addition to constructing an appropriate
              theoretical framework and demonstrating its utility for the interpretation of
              single molecule experiments, the team hopes to translate insight gained from
              the study of biological motors to the design and control of engineered motors
              that perform specific functions at the nanoscale. The broad impact of this work
              is that it may not only shed new light on the mechanism by which DNA
              replication is controlled in cells but also lead to novel strategies for
              controlling molecular scale processes and the function of nanodevices.
