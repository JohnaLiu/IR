Title:  NIRT: Nanoscale
              Sensing of Single Cell Surface Receptor Affinity for Individual
              Ligands


This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and
              Engineering initiative, NSF 01-157, category NIRT.

The PI's are planning to
              use novel techniques based on the modification of an AFM tip to measure the
              affinity of a single cell surface receptor to its ligand.  The approach is
              quite innovative and would result in significant new developments in this area.
