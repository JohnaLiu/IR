A novel techniques based on
              modification of ink jet printing technology for controlled Gene delivery and
              development of a new technology for tissue engineering is proposed.    The PIs
              seek to create a biomimetic extracellular matrix with controlled
              temporal-spatial patterns of NanoCaPs that contains DNAs or plasmid growth
              factor.  The controlled patterns will be created with the ink-jet technology
              and the performance will be evaluated in-vitro.
