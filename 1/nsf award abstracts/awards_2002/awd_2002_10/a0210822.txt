One of the effective techniques of
              mathematics for dealing 
with problems of several parameters or dimensions is
              
combinatorial, or algebraic, topology.  In that field, 
geometric objects,
              called cycles, associated to constraints
are grouped into deformation or
              homology classes which then 
combine and decompose in various combinations to
              define 
algebraic structures of such richness to provoke a theoretical 
study
              in the own right of a variety of algebraic structures. 
Recently some of these
              structures have appeared in theoretical 
physics in the attempted formalism to
              describe term by term 
models for quantum phenomena.

In collaboration, the
              principal investigator has recently 
discovered related algebraic topology
              structures in the 
space of strings (open and closed) filling up a space
              (time) 
model.  This award will sponsor investigations to  
conceptually
              clarify the occurance of algebraic topology 
in theoretical quantum physics
              and to relate the results of
these investigations to new string algebra.
