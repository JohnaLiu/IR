Abstract    :
              

	This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering
              initiative, NSF 01-157, category NER.  Strong evidence of a single-photon
              tunneling effect, a direct analog of single-electron tunneling, has been
              obtained recently in our measurements of light tunneling through individual
              subwavelength pinholes in a thick gold film covered with a layer of
              polydiacetylene. The transmission of some pinholes reached saturation because
              of the optical nonlinearity of polydiacetylene at a very low light intensity of
              a few thousands photons per second. This result has been explained
              theoretically in terms of "photon blockade", similar to the Coulomb blockade
              phenomenon observed in single-electron tunneling experiments. The single-photon
              tunneling effect may find many applications in the emerging fields of quantum
              communication and information processing. The experiments reported so far have
              been performed for random pinholes that are naturally present in thin metal
              films. There is no detailed knowledge on the shape and size of the pinholes
              necessary to produce this effect under controlled conditions, which severely
              limits advancement of the theoretical description of the effect and its
              possible applications. We propose to expand these experiments to study
              single-photon tunneling effect in well-controlled geometries, by making use of
              ion-beam milling fabrication techniques. Based on this research we are going to
              explore a number of novel device ideas in the areas of optical communications
              and quantum optics.
