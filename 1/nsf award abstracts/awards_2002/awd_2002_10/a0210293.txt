Abstract    :
              This Nanoscale Exploratory Research (NER) award to Ohio State University is
              supported by Divisions of Chemistry (MPS) and Physics (MPS), and this proposal
              was submitted in response to the solicitation "Nanoscale Science and
              Engineering" (NSF 01-157).  With this award, Professors Subramaniam and Lempert
              will synthesize, separate and manipulate single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)
              using Coulomb crystals in plasmas. Coulomb crystals will be formed with SWNTs
              (or aggregates thereof) at the lattice centers either by introducing these into
              a striated DC glow discharge plasma or by synthesizing them in-situ, the latter
              being accomplished using carbon monoxide and a nickel catalyst.  Because of the
              large aspect ratios, Coulomb crystals formed with SWNTs are expected to have
              unusual structure and properties, and they will provide a unique environment in
              which fundamental understanding of nanotube formation and growth processes may
              be studied non-intrusively using spectroscopic methods.   The SWNTs suspended
              in the Coulomb crystal will be separated and manipulated depending on their
              electrical characteristics and size using Scanning Tunneling Microscope
              conducting tips.  With this award, students will be trained in the synthesis
              and modification of carbon nanotubes.

Single-walled carbon nanotubes
              suspended in Coulomb crystals will be prepared using an electric glow discharge
              plasma or by chemical methods from carbon monoxide in the presence of a nickel
              catalyst.  Carbon nanotubes formed will be separated and manipulated based on
              their electrical properties and size using Scanning Tunneling Microscope
              conducting tips.
