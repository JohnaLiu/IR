The objective of the proposed research is to
              understand how temperature and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM)
              influence the impact of UV on food webs in lakes. We hypothesize that climate
              change will regulate UV damage at both the molecular level (by altering
              temperature), and at the ecosystem level (by altering CDOM).  We hypothesize
              that high UV, low temperature conditions will favor plant-based food webs while
              lower UV: temperature ratios conditions will favor bacteria-based food webs,
              with important consequences for zooplankton, fish, and ecosystem structure and
              function. A carefully focused set of analytical and experimental approaches
              will test these hypotheses in the lab, and in the field at different elevations
              with different UV and CDOM conditions. 

It is widely recognized that
              environmental UV is damaging, but little is known about how molecular repair of
              UV damage varies with temperature or how these effects propagate up to the
              ecosystem level. The proposed research will advance our understanding of how
              lakes are likely to respond to future changes in temperature and UV related to
              alteration of climate and ozone.  Students will be closely integrated into the
              research to provide them with the diverse range of quantitative skills
              necessary to tackle some of the complex issues that environmental biologists
              face in this period of human-accelerated environmental change.
