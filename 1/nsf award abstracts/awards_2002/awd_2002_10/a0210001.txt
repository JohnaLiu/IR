              ABSTRACT

OCE-0210001


With this Small Grant for Exploratory Research,
              researchers at the University of Massachusetts at Boston will investigate the
              environmental impact of the World Trade Center terrorist attack on September
              11, 2001, by studying the chemistry and mineralogy of sediments of New York
              Harbor.  The studies will determine whether atmospheric and storm-water inputs
              of dust, debris, and contaminants can be used with radiotracers to identify and
              characterize an event-related stratigraphic imprint, assess impacts on sediment
              quality, and characterize spatial aspects of sedimentation.
