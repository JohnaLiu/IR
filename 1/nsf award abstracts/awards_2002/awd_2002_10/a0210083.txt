Proposal Title: 	2002 Gordon Research Conference on
              Catalysis

Institution:			Gordon Research Conferences


The Gordon Conference on
              Catalysis (GCC) in 2002 will be held on June 23-28 Colby-Sawyer College in New
              Hampshire.  The conference will focus on several areas that are key to the
              fundamental understanding of catalytic systems: molecular level
              characterization of catalysts, quantitative descriptions of reaction pathways,
              novel materials, fuel cell catalysis, chiral catalysis, and the conversion of
              nitrogen oxides in combustion products.  The themes and speakers are of
              interest to both academic and industrial communities.  Current and future
              trends in heterogeneous catalysis will be the general theme.  This grant will
              provide partial support for speakers, graduate students, post-doctoral
              students, and younger faculty.
