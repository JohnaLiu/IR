Abstract    :
              A conference on "Ontological, Epistemological, Linguistic and Pedagogical
              Considerations of Language and Science Literacy:  Empowering Research and
              Informing Instruction" is proposed.  The emphases of the conference are (1) the
              development of theoretical framework for understanding and developing
              language-science literacy connections and (2) establishing a group of
              researchers interested in classroom-based research projects focused on
              critical, practice-derived issues language and science literacy issues.  A
              premise is that research needs to focus on determining what science literacy
              practices work in the classroom and build explanations of why these work.  The
              conference will address (1) clarification of the roles of speaking, reading,
              writing, and listening in authentic science learning communities in elementary,
              middle, secondary, post-secondary, and post-graduate settings, (2) exploration
              of the influences of information technologies on language and science literacy,
              (3) the establishment of a contemporary theoretical framework involving
              language, information technology, science and science literacy, and (4) the
              consolidation and extension of international, interdisciplinary and
              intergenerational network of professional scientists, applied cognitive
              scientists, language and science researchers, graduate students, and teacher
              educators.

The conference will begin by exploring the nature of science, the
              linguistic components of doing science, the ontological and epistemological
              considerations in science literacy, the influence of information technology on
              language production and processing, and the critical relationships between
              language, science, and science learning.  It will continue by summarizing the
              results of recent explorations of oral and written discourse on science
              literacy.  The conference will conclude by outlining some avenues for future
              research, some implications for classroom practice, and some applications for
              teacher education.
