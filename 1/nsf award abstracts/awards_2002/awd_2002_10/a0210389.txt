Abstract    :
               The project examines how social environments at the family, neighborhood, and
              school levels affect individuals' achievement of their genetic potential in
              late adolescence and young adulthood.  When genetic predispositions influence a
              particular human behavior,  the expression of such predispositions are
              moderated by environmental influences.  At birth, each child has a genetic
              potential, but the chances of achieving the potential are conditioned by
              environmental factors.  Thus, advantaged family environments generally boost
              the realization of youth's genetic potential for educational achievement. 
              Social contexts such as neighborhoods and schools also moderate the expression
              of the genetic propensity for educational achievement and early work success. 
              Educational success will be measured using data on college plans, grade point
              average, grade retention, intellectual development, and high school graduation.
               Data will be drawn from genetically informative sibling data from four waves
              of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.   The project will
              develop statistical methods that permit analysis of the heritability -
              environment interaction for binary outcomes such as college plans and event
              history outcomes such as grade retention.
