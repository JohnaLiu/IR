Crommie, Michael

This proposal was received in response to the
              Nanoscale Science and 
Engineering initiative, NSF 01-157, category NIRT.  The
              main objective of this project is to develop and characterize mechanical
              devices at the nanoscale.  This will be performed through the creation of new,
              synthetic molecular machines purposefully designed in a molecule-by-molecule
              fashion.  In order to achieve this goal an interdisciplinary team of
              researchers has been gathered that will engage in the following
              
activities:
1) chemically synthesize new molecules having tailored
              properties to be used as nano-machine components, 2) adhere newly synthesized
              molecules to prepared surfaces and demonstrate mechanical functionality, 3)
              combine photolithographic MEMS technology with carbon growth techniques to
              create electro-mechanically actuated molecular motors from carbon nanotubes. 
              Two new categories of functional molecular assemblies are expected to result
              from this research.  The first involves chemically engineered molecules
              designed with specific mechanical functions in mind.  This research thrust will
              be supported by a strong chemical synthesis effort aimed at the development of
              new classes of molecules able to undergo conformational changes when triggered
              by an outside stimulus.  The second category involves the engineering of
              multi-wall carbon nanotubes to form the basis of a new mechano-molecular
              technology.  This effort is expected to culminate in the demonstration of the
              first functional nanotube motor.
