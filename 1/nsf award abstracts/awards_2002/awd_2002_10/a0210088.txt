Abstract    :
              The purpose of this study is to capitalize on several mature technologies to
              obtain regional and global maps of ionospheric irregularities and some of their
              statistical properties (e.g., second moment) by use of diffraction tomography. 
              In utilizing the GPS signals for 3D mapping of ionospheric irregularities, we
              are taking advantage of (1) the growing number of space receivers recording GPS
              phase and amplitude data while occulting behind the ionosphere, (2) the very
              dense regional networks and large global networks of GPS ground receivers
              providing over 30 million links per day through the ionosphere, (3) advances
              made in ionospheric tomography and data assimilation techniques, (4) advances
              made in diffraction tomography.
