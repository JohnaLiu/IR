Abstract    :
              his proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF01-157.  Quantum
computing
              offers the prospect of computational power far beyond that
which could be
              obtained merely by scaling current technologies to
ever-smaller scales. 
              However, recent "proof-of-principle"
realizations of quantum  computers do not
              appear to be amenable to
large-scale integration, like   current solid-state
              technology. One
of the outstanding unsolved problems in  materials theory
              is
understanding the feasibility of a solid-state quantum bit  (qubit),
the
              fundamental building block of a quantum computer.  The proposed 
research will
              study the possibility to use a pair of extremely
small  semiconducting islands
              (with diameters less than 20
nanometers) as a solid-state  qubit.  The
              dynamics of quantum
control in this system will be investigated 
              theoretically,
including the coupling to the environment, which tends to 
              "collapse
the wavefunction" of the qubit.  This problem is an example of
              a
very  general problem in quantum mechanics, that of tunneling in
              the
presence of a  dissipative environment. It is closely related to
              an
analogous problem in  nuclear physics, the decay of a
              superdeformed
nucleus. Progress in understanding  the proposed mathematical
              model
is thus likely to impact not only nanoscience  and quantum
computing,
              but also nuclear physics (femtoscience). 

As a testbed for the solid-state
              qubit, it is proposed that such a
double  quantum dot can be operated as an
              electron pump with a
quantized electrical  current.  Because the operating
              frequency of
the proposed electron pump would be  much greater than that of
              
previous quantized current sources, it could be  significant for
metrology. 
              The accuracy of the current quantization in this set-up
is a measure of the
              fidelity of the qubit under repeated logical 
manipulations.  This research is
              cofunded by the Divisions of
Materials Research and Physics.
