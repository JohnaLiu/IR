Abstract    :
              This scholarship for service proposal supports three 2-year cohorts of 14
              students each, with an estimated distribution of eight undergraduate and
              graduate students at Georgia Tech, and six undergraduates at the three
HBCU
              institutions, Clark-Atlanta University, Morehouse College, and Spelman College,
              which are partners in this proposal.  The project is directed by the Georgia
              Tech Information Security Center (GTISC),  an NSA designated Center of
              Excellence for Information Assurance Education (CAE/IAE).  The GTISC
              educational program includes a comprehensive curriculum that serves a broad
              range of students and covers both technology and policy.  Six carefully
              considered courses dedicated to IA/IS have been developed and offered in the
              past year, and these help provide a basis for IA/IS concentrations at all
              degree levels.  The faculty at Georgia Tech are working with the faculty at the
              three partner institutions to introduce IA/IS courses and topics into their
              curricula, to take their students into our advanced classes, and to support
              prospective IA/IS scholars at these schools.

IA/IS educational programs at
              Georgia Tech and current and planned efforts at the HBCU institutions offer us
              the opportunity to recruit, train and graduate a diverse and well prepared
              group of professionals who will be able to help protect the computational and
              communication infrastructure of the country.
