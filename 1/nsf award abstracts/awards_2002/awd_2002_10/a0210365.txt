This proposal was received in response to the Nanoscale Science
              and Engineering Initiative NSF 01-157, category NER.

The main objective of
              this research is the optical and mechanical characterization of
              the
nanoengineered collagen tissues produced by a novel electrospinning
              technique
developed at the Virginia Commonwealth University. The prospect of
              using a person's
own cells (keratocytes) as a vehicle for development of a new
              cornea will also be
investigated by culturing corneal cells in the engineered
              collagen matrix.
