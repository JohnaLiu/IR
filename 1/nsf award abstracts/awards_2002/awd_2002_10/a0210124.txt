Abstract    :
              This project investigates the potential for augmenting damping in
composite
              structures by taking advantage of the energy dissipation between
densely
              packed, highly interconnected networks of multi-walled carbon
nanotubes
              (nano-films) . The novel, nano-engineered damping films
developed in this
              project are expected to offer several advantages: 
1) Nano-films show no
              degradation in structure/properties upto 600 deg C 
and are expected to offer
              superior performance and reliability for high
temperature applications. 2)
              Nano-films do not exhibit resin penetration
when co-cured within composite
              structures and could potentially be
seamlessly integrated into heterogeneous
              systems. 3) Nano-films offer
multi-functionality in terms of enhanced
              stiffness in addition to damping
augmentation. The specific stiffness of
              nano-films are expected to be an
order of magnitude greater than commercially
              available viscoelastic
polymer films. This research project is directed
              towards further exploring
and developing these concepts so as to enable the
              efficient synthesis of
these novel multifunctional materials into multi-scale
              structural systems.

The project involves strong interdisciplinary
              collaboration between
material science (patterning and assembly of
              nanostructures) and
mechanical engineering (damping and stiffness increase in
              composites). 
The project will contribute to the training of 1 Ph.D student
              and several
undergraduate students (under the Undergraduate Research Projects
              - URP
Program) at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
