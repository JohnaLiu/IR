Abstract    :
              A workshop on "Hybrid Systems:  Computation and Control" was held at Stanford
              University, March 25-27, 2002. The importance of hybrid discrete and continuous
              control has emerged over the last several years, as hardware and software
              technology provide ever more applications, ranging from everyday life to
              mission-critical situations.  At the same time, the lack of a satisfactory,
              cost-effective design methodology for reliable and efficient hybrid controllers
              has become apparent.   This workshop, emphasizing issues in computation and
              control, was one in a series dedicated to developing a scientific community and
              a body of knowledge that synthesizes discrete and continuous technologies.  The
              purpose of the workshop series is to provide a regular, annual forum for novel
              results, methodologies, and tools in the emerging area of hybrid systems.   The
              proceedings of the workshop are published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes
              in Computer Science series.
