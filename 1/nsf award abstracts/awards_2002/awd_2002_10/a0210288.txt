Abstract    :
              This work seeks to describe the thermalization of electrons at a silicon/silicon
              dioxide interface representative of a power MOSFET device.  The interface is
              characterized in one case by 
hydrogen passivated silicon bonds, and in the
              other case without the hydrogen.  It has been shown experimentally that the
              hydrogen improves device performance, but that the longevity of 
the hydrogen
              is limited.  Therefore, the reliability of a device with hydrogen is uncertain.
               Through modeling and simulation, the physical processes governing the device
              behavior will be 
examined.  The analysis will be performed using Monte Carlo
              techniques that follow single electrons.  The scattering will be determined
              from cross-sections of the important scatterers in 
the problem.  In the
              present case, the cross-sections for silicon and hydrogen can be obtained from
              the literature. However, the hydrogen-silicon bonds represent a modified phonon
              
distribution.  This distribution has been measured experimentally, and can be
              incorporated into the simulation through a modified cross-section at the
              interface.  Careful description of the physical process will lead to an
              evaluation of   device performance.  Parametric studies can then lead to
              enhanced device designs.
