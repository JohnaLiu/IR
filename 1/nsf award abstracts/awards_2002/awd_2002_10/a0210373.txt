Quantum computers seem the
              subject of science fiction, but their tremendous
computational potential is
              closer than we may think.  Despite significant
practical difficulties, small
              quantum devices of 5 to 7 bits have been built
in the laboratory.  Silicon
              technologies promise even greater scalability.
To use these technologies
              effectively, and help guide quantum device
research, computer architects need
              to start designing and reasoning about
quantum processors now.  However, two
              major hurdles stand in the way.
First, compactly describable rules that
              characterize silicon-based quantum
computing technologies are not known. 
              Second, there does not exist an
infrastructure to design, test, and evaluate
              architectural alternatives.

This grant addresses both of these
items. 
              First, we will formalize the design rules of a widely discussed
and likely
              quantum device technology.  Second, we have already begun to
develop
              architectural abstractions for this technology that can be composed
together
              to form general-purpose quantum information processors.  Third,
using these
              abstractions we will develop an automated computer aided
design tool that
              takes a description of a quantum computing architecture and
compiles it to a
              device library of quantum cells.  Finally, we will
develop a simulator that
              quickly estimates the cost-performance of quantum
systems.

These research
              goals, once accomplished, will serve as foundational
resources for the
              development of quantum computer architectures.  In
addition, by reasoning
              about architectures we can begin to find the limits
of current quantum device
              proposals.  These limits can be turned into
research goals, items that further
              quantum device research needs to
overcome.
