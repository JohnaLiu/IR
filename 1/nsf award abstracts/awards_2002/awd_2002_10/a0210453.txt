Abstract    :
              It is proposed to conduct experimental research to investigate the relationship
              between Brownian motion and shear induced migration in biomedical microdevices.
               And to use the Brownian motion to characterize the temperature of the system. 
              It is also planned to develop an interdiscidplinary course with the co-PI who
              is a faculty member of the English Department to help educate non-science
              students on nanoscale technologies.
