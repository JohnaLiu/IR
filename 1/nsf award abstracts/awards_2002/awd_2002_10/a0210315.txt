Abstract    :
              Professor Cynthia Zoski of Georgia State University and Dr. Peixin He of CH
              Instruments are funded through a GOALI grant in the Analytical and Surface
              Chemistry Program.  The project is to develop microelectrode arrays as
              multicomponent sensors for the study of complex samples.  Each element of the
              array consists of a cluster of parallel-connected nano- to micro-sized
              electrodes.  Each cluster can be individually addressed by a multichannel
              potentiostat.  The development of the arrays, including chemical modification
              of the electrode surfaces and characterization, will be performed at the
              University, and the instrumentation, circuitry and software will be developed
              in collaboration with CH Instruments.  Array characterization will be carried
              out, in part, by the novel application of scanning electrochemical microscopy. 
              Target applications include bacterial detection and heavy metal screening. 
              

This research is aimed at developing an instrument that is capable of many
              applications, including chemical and biological sensing for environmental and
              homeland security monitoring.
