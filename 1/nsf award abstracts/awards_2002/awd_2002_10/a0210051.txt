Abstract    :
              Nanowires/tubes have the potential to contribute significantly to the continued
              size reduction of micro/nano-mechanical systems. Knowledge of the thermal
              characteristics of nanowires/tubes is the basis for predicting, controlling,
              and achieving desired thermal performance of micro- and nanosized devices. This
              one-year exploratory research is to develop a novel experimental
              characterization tool to characterize the thermal transport along
              nanowires/tubes. The proposed experiment involves modulated laser beam heating
              on one side of a substrate while nanowires/tubes have been grown
              perpendicularly on the other side. Variation of the thermal radiation from the
              laser-heated side is detected and related to the thermophysical properties of
              nanowires/tubes. The unique thermal depth profiling capability of the
              experiment makes it possible to identify and characterize the thermal
              conductivity of nanowires/tubes and the thermal contact resistance between
              nanowires/tubes and the substrate. The quantitative investigation of this
              thermal contact resistance is a first step, also an essential step, toward the
              thermal design of joints between nanowires/tubes and micro- and
              nanodevices.
