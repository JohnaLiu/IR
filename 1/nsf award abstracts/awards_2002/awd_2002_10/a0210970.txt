Abstract    :
              The focus of the SGER grant is on a new processing technique based on mechanical
              milling that involves chemical reaction during milling process. The method
              eliminates the traditional leaching process that is usually required to isolate
              the metal from by-product salts. The process involves introducing aluminum as a
              reducing agent, in place of Mg, Ca or Na. The starting material is metal
              chloride and the by-product aluminum chloride can be separated by vacuum
              distillation in lieu of leaching thereby eliminating the usually noted surface
              oxidation. The proof-of-concept will be checked in processing nickel aluminide
              starting from nickel chloride with aluminum. The resulting powder is
              consolidated by pressing at slightly high temperatures that will result in
              fine-grained alloy. The production of NiAl by this new method will be very
              cost-effective because of the low processing temperature and the valuable
              by-product. The technique once proven and established will be applicable for
              other aluminides that find extensive application as high-temperature structural
              material.

The new technique of using Al as a reducing agent during
              mechanochemical reaction eliminates the usually required second step of
              leaching that in general results in surface oxidation. This process once proven
              effective can be adopted for processing of many other metal alloys with
              superior purity along with substantial cost reduction.
