The assembly of well defined 2D nanocrystal arrays of semiconducting and
              metallic materials using biologically assembled nanoscale template is the major
              goal in the proposed project.  The PI will explore the purple membrane, a
              naturally occurring membrane protein crystal patch from halobacteria as a
              precisely structured nanoscale template.  The key is to develop genetically
              engineered purple membranes that display unique functional groups on the
              membrane surfaces with well defined nanoscale symmetry.  These reactive
              functional groups are used as specific anchoring sites for nanocrystals
              immobilization.
