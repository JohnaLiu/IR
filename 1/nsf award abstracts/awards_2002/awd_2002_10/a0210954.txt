Abstract    :
              The PIs propose an experimental study to examine how the catalysis of organic
              molecules may be influenced by the conversion of smectite to illite via the I/S
              (illite/smectite) transitional structural states. Basically, simple organic
              molecules may be held in interlayer smectite sites while the smectite converts
              to illite. This mineralogic change could catalyze the formation of more complex
              organic products in present day hydrothermal systems and the early earth, with
              implications for the origin of life. The idea is that the polymerized organics
              would be protected by being in interlayer positions. Experiments will be
              conducted at 300 degrees C, 250 degrees C, and 200 degrees C, and 250 bars, an
              appropriate pressure for seafloor hydrothermal systems. Experiments will
              explore the effects of different starting concentrations, Eh, pH, and salinity
              conditions on catalysis of polymerized organic molecules. Some experiments will
              be in sealed capsules, whereas others will be in large vessels that can be
              sampled from time to time as the smectite changes to illite, with interlayer
              organics presumably also changing in interesting ways. The experimental
              materials will be analyzed with XRF, GCMS, HPLC, IC, and FTIR plus MALDI-TOF, a
              new technique for analyzing small amounts of organics on solids in situ.
