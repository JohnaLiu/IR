Abstract    :
              This proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation "Nanoscale Science
              and Engineering" (NSF 01-157).  This research project aims to demonstrate the
              feasibility of using carbon nanotubes for nanodimensional optoelectronic
              devices. Preliminary results have shown that optical activity in the visible
              spectrum is induced with additions of ruthenium to multiwall carbon nanotubes
              (MWNTs). This project will focus on in-situ doping MWNTs with other optically
              active materials, in particular rare earth elements, by introducing proper
              organic precursors during the chemical-vapor-deposition growth. Through this
              chemical vapor deposition process, rare-earth elements will be introduced into
              the nanotube architectures, leading to luminescent behavior in the visible
              spectrum. The advantage of using a nanotube host is that the luminescent
              particles can be confined to dimensions of a few nanometers. Since the
              deposition temperatures are low (~600 degrees C) it will also be possible to
              directly deposit the materials directly onto display glass and other device
              substrates. The research program will support the involvement of an
              undergraduate and graduate student, who will have a unique opportunity to
              pursue research at the cutting edge of nanoscience and nanotechnology.

Since
              nanotubes can be patterned on various device substrates such as silicon and
              glass, revolutionary advances in nanodimensional optoelectronic devices, such
              as high-resolution information displays are now possible. The research program
              will educate both undergraduate and graduate students from the Pennsylvania
              State University in the emerging, interdisciplinary field of nanoscience and
              nanotechnology. Since these areas are high priority ones in the academic,
              industrial, and government laboratory sectors, these students will be highly
              competitive in these and related job markets.
