Abstract    :
              With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division,
              Kathleen Morgan of the Department of Chemistry at Xavier has begun a study of
              the Cope Rearrangement, which is a reaction where new carbon-carbon bonds are
              made with high regio- and stereo selectivity, via the reorganization of a
              1,5-hexadiene. The goal of this study is to determine whether the reaction rate
              can be accelerated with the attachment of cationic substituents on the reactive
              core of the system. The formation of carbon-carbon bonds is at the heart of
              organic chemistry, yet there are a limited number of ways to construct them.
              The creation of the carbon-based skeleton often represents much of the
              challenge in synthesis. The Cope Rearrangement has been much studied and
              heavily exploited in synthesis and yet we are still not able to claim that it
              is fully understood or that it has reached its full potential in synthetic
              applications. The experimental and theoretical study of the Cope rearrangement
              of 1,5 hexadienes bearing electron-withdrawing groups at the 3 position is a
              well-defined project that has the potential to yield fundamental insights into
              this rearrangement and extend the full synthetic utility of this reaction.
              Because of the importance of carbon-carbon bond making, this project creatively
              blends literature, theory, and wet chemistry in order to increase understanding
              of the chemistry and produce novel methodology.

Professor Kathleen
              Morgan, of the Department of Chemistry at Xavier University, with the support
              of the Organic Dynamics Program, will conducted her research at an historically
              black undergraduate university (HBCU). Undergraduates are capable of performing
              the majority of the proposed research. The preliminary results were obtained by
              more than a dozen undergraduates at Professor Morgan's previous institution.
              Underrepresented students will have the opportunity to participate in all
              aspects of this fundamental research including the synthesis of organic
              compounds using a series of known procedures, development of new reactions,
              purification and characterization of products, determination of reaction rates
              by spectroscopy, and computational studies.
