Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) Program,
              the Department of Chemistry at the City University of New York - City College
              Campus will acquire a 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable
              researchers to carry out studies on (i) studies of chemically modified
              nucleosides and DNA; (ii) synthesis of unusual nucleosides and studies on DNA
              containing them; (iii) synthesis of high energy-density N-nitramino and geminal
              difluoramino solid propellants; (iv) studies of the structure and dynamics of
              selected isolated protein fragments to learn about the unfolded state of
              proteins; (v) novel pharmacophores against opportunistic infections related to
              AIDS; (vi) studies of the S-layer protein of Lactobacillus brevis; and (vii)
              synthesis of enediyne glycofuranosides.   

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. 
              Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including synthetic chemistry, pharmaceutical
              chemistry and biology.
