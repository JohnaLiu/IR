Title:	Finite-size particle in
              homogeneous turbulence

An effective computational approach has been
              developed by the PI for direct simulation of finite size particles suspended in
              incompressible fluid.  The proposed project investigates the feasibility of
              using this method for direct simulation of many finite size particles in
              homogeneous turbulent flow.  If successful, this approach would provide a
              powerful tool to analyze the challenging problems associated with the impact of
              particulate turbulent flow.
