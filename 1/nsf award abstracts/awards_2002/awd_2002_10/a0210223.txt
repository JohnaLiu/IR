Abstract    :
              This Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Team (NIRT), co-funded by the Divisions of
              Materials Research (DMR), Chemical and Transport Systems (CTS) and Design,
              Manufacturing and Industrial Innovation (DMII) will use genetically directed
              synthetic methods to permit exact control of the placement (at intervals of .6
              nm, 1.0 nm, and/or 1.6 nm) of reactive chemical groups along a polypeptide
              backbone.  These reactive groups will be both biologically active and
              electroactive providing novel materials for processing into fibers via
              electrospinning techniques.  The fiber morphology, which will be varied by a
              judicious choice of processing conditions, will be characterized by electron
              microscopy, small angle neutron scattering and Raman spectroscopy.  Mechanical
              properties of individual fibers will be evaluated using MEMS and NEMS devices
              while the biological activity of the electrospun fiber mats will be
              investigated by cell incubation studies.
%%%
The results of these
              investigations will provide molecular design rules for future biomaterial
              constructs and will lead to a new generation of tissue scaffold materials for
              wound repair.  The hybrid bio-electronic materials that result will address
              some of the lifetime and brightness issues for next generation flat panel
              computer displays that are critical for future industrial manufacturing.  The
              integration of this research and education through externship experiences at
              DuPont and the development of new courses on nanomaterials design and
              processing will provide knowledge and an experience base that will equip
              students with the work-force ready skills critically needed by industry.
