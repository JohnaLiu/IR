Abstract    :
              This Math and Science Partnership includes San Francisco State University, the
              Berkeley Unified School District, the Jefferson Elementary School District, and
              the South San Francisco Unified School District.  

The partnership is
              focusing on improving student performance in algebra by uniting three distinct
              groups of educators: middle and high school algebra teachers (grades 8-10),
              undergraduate mathematics majors with interests in secondary education, and
              graduate mathematics students who teach remedial college algebra.  The cohort
              is working together to ensure the successful learning of algebra for students,
              particularly underrepresented students, at the high school and undergraduate
              level.  Improved student achievement results from the collaboration and its
              emphasis on improving the effectiveness of teachers.  A key component of the
              project is professional development based on the Japanese lesson study model
              that engages teams of teachers and graduate students in professional
              discussions centered on classroom lessons.  Benchmarks include increased
              percentages of students enrolling in and passing both high school and college
              algebra courses.  Undergraduate mathematics majors, by assisting in the
              secondary schools, receive the classroom experience needed to encourage them to
              become teachers while improving their teaching capabilities.
