Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research, in part motivated by events of
              September 11, 2001, will undertake preliminary background study of the building
              code enforcement process when challenged by the need to rebuild rapidly in the
              face of natural or man-made disaster.  The goal is to prepare for further
              research on improving the quality and efficiency of code enforcement services
              in emergency situations by gathering data and documenting system flows.  The
              researchers will also identify opportunities to streamline the permitting and
              code enforcement processes while continuing to protect the interests of the
              community.  A minimum of two municipalities will be used as case studies in
              accomplishing the analysis.
