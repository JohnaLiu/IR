Abstract    :
              This project is proposed by a partnership that includes the Stark County
              Educational Service Center; seventeen school districts (Alliance City, Canton
              City, Canton Local, Plain Local, Fairless Local, Jackson Local, Lake Local,
              Louisville City Local, Marlington Local, Massillon City, Minerva Local, North
              Canton City, Northwest, Osnaburg Local, Perry Local, Sandy Valley Local and
              Tuslaw Local ); the East Regional Professional Development Center; Stark
              Education Partnership (a business and community organization); and five
              institutions of higher education located in Stark County ( Malone College,
              Walsh University, Kent State University-Stark Campus, Mount Union College and
              Stark State College of Technology).

The partnership focuses on raising
              student achievement and reducing the achievement gap in mathematics and science
              at 44 middle and high schools in Stark County, OH, and is designed to impact
              over 40,000 students and approximately 650 middle and high school math and
              science pre-service and in-service teachers.  The hallmarks of the Stark County
              Math and Science Partnership (SCMSP)  are the development of urban centers
              linked to reducing the achievement gap, increasing inquiry and real world
              problem solving teaching skills, and collaboration and networking among
              secondary teachers and college content and methods faculty.  Four Urban centers
              will be created to address performance disparity in districts with the largest
              minority populations and largest achievement gaps: Alliance City, Canton City
              Massillon /city and Plain Local.  These centers will be located in the high
              schools of these districts and will have aspects of both professional
              development schools and lab schools with college faculty, preservice teachers,
              coursework, seminars, field experiences and practice teaching on-site.  While
              these urban centers will provide concentrated support to four districts, all 17
              districts will participate in the Lead Teachers, Study Group, Peer-Coaching,
              Summer institutes, and Industry Internships components of this endeavor in
              order to increase inquiry and real work problem-solving in mathematics and
              science classrooms.
