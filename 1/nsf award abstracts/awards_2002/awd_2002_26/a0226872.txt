This award supports the PI and graduate students from the
              University of Arizona in a collaboration with Mads Sorenson of the Department
              of Informatics and Mathematical Modeling at the Technical University of Denmark
              in Lyngby.  The research will focus on two physical problems.  One is the study
              of integrated photonic devices; a second is the propagation of ultra short
              pulses and beams in nonlinear media, including air.  The problem of femtosecond
              light pulses in bulk media is a challenging computational problem because the
              high intensity of the laser pulse can cause optical breakdown of the material
              leading to highly nonlinear response.  Recently developed efficient parallel
              algorithms will be applied to the problem of modeling ultra short pulses in
              nonlinear media.  For the study of short pulse dynamics in photonic crystal
              fibers, theoretical calculations will be done to investigate supercontinuuum
              generation, soliton self-frequency shift, and third-harmonic generation.

The
              combined effort of the US and Danish groups is expected to provide a much
              needed theoretical and numerical component to the important technologies
              associated with applications of ultra short pulse phenomena.  The topic area
              has the potential to produce revolutionary advances in the fields of
              communications, medicine, energy efficiency, defense, and manufacturing.
