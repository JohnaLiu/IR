OIA-0226068

The objectives of the workshop are to: brief G-8
              representatives on the roles, methodologies, and impacts of research assessment
              activities in the United States; compare and contrast U.S. and other G-8
              approaches to research assessment; develop best-practices in research
              assessment; identify major unresolved research and implementation issues; and
              contribute to the development of collaborative policy and research networks in
              research assessment activities among G-8 members.

Assuming these objectives
              are realized, all US agencies that conduct or support 
research will benefit
              from the development and dissemination of best practices in 
research
              assessment and the identification of major unresolved issues.  The research
              
community will also benefit from the dissemination of information on
              comparative 
methodologies for research assessment.
