Abstract    :
              Continued single-year, high-precision (0.2%) measurements of carbon-14 (C-14)
              from tree-ring samples will be made in order to provide a continuous record
              from AD 998 to 1954.  The record will be examined for evidence of high-energy
              solar flare events, and hard gamma-rays associated with Supernova RX
              J0852.0-4622 (ca. 1300-1350).  It will also be possible to determine if the
              11yr and 22yr cosmic ray modulation cycles extend through the Oort and Wolf
              Minima.  The search for correlations between changes in solar activity and
              climate change will continue to be emphasized.  Participation in the
              construction of INTCAL 03 will also be supported.
