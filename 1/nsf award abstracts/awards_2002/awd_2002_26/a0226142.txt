Abstract    :
              Funds from this award will support exploratory research for the
              rapid
development of novel cryogenic scintillators.  This project has
              special
urgency because of the potential broad application of
              these
scintillators to a variety of established research topics, such as
              the
observation of low energy solar neutrinos and the detection of
              cosmic
dark matter.  If these scintillators work as well as expected,
              the
impact of this work on the field of non-accelerator particle
              physics
would be profound and immediate.  The proposed cryogenic
              scintillator
would consist of liquid or solid neon, possibly doped with a
              small
amount (1%) of xenon.  Condensed neon holds special promise
              for
low-background measurements, but its scintillation yield and
              optical
properties have received scant attention in the past.
