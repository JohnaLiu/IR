Abstract    :
              A novel laser-ablation deposition technique will be used to deposit high quality
              multiplayers of magnetic oxides at the atomic scale. The purpose is to
              synthesize single crystal films of the spinel structure in which one layer
              consists solely of Mn2+ ions and the other alternating layer of only Fe3+ ions.
              Although the average chemical composition is that of MnFe2O4, the magnetic
              structure is that of a normal ferrite in a spinel structure. The magnetic
              structure of MnFe2O4 grown by the natural process is that of an inverse
              magnetic structure, in which both Fe3+ and Mn2+ can be found in the same layer,
              for example. Thus, this technique allows for the growth of ferrites by
              artificial control.

The implication of the success of this technique is
              enormous. Scientifically, we will be able to test fundamental theories of
              magnetism directly instead of depending what natural process allows. It also
              means that one can engineer ferrites for various applications and technical
              needs. Magnetic sensors will be improved to the point that it will impact
              medical imaging techniques, computer memories (speed and size), and the
              wireless communication components. In summary, a new generation of ferrite
              materials will be established, which will have impact in all phases of
              technology.
