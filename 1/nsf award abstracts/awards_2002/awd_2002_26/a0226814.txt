Abstract    :
              This proposal will enable participation of junior researchers in the"Frontiers
              of Nuclear Structure" Conference to be held on the campus of the University of
              California at Berkeley.  The conference covers a variety of topics, including
              nuclei under extreme conditions, and astrophysics.  The majority of the talks
              will be selected from contributed abstracts, which generally favors a higher
              fraction ofnjunior speakers compared with a program generated from
              predominantly invited talks.
