Abstract    :
              The goal of the research will be to involve science students from Saint Anselm
              College, an undergraduate teaching institution, in a meaningful research
              project incorporating state-of-the-art technology.  All research will be
              conducted in the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for
              Biomolecular Interaction Technologies (BITC) at the University of New Hampshire
              and will make extensive use of the fluorescence detection optical system on the
              BITC analytical ultracentrifuge.  All data will be reported to BITC.  The
              project will serve as a test of the new device, and it will  help develop
              protocols for using analytical ultracentrifugation with whole-cell lysates.
