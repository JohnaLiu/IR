Abstract    :
              The aim of the proposed work is to study the behavior of low regularity
              solutions to nonlinear wave equations. This problem is by now well understood
              for generic equations. However, most nonlinear wave equations arising in
              physics (e.g., Einstein's equations in general relativity) exhibit some kind of
              special structure which, one expects, guarantees a much better behavior of
              solutions than for a generic equation. It is precisely this type of equations
              that the proposed research will focus on. This subject is largely unexplored,
              and, until now, was considered 
to be out of reach. However, recent work of
              the PI may hold the key to progress in this field.
