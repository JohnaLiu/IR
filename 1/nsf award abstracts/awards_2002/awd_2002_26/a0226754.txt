This U.S.-Mexico award will help to support the travel of
              three students from the United States and one from developing countries to the
              First School/Workshop on Instrumentation in Elementary Particle Physics.  The
              School will be held at the new Center for Instrumentation, located at the
              University of Michoacan San Nicolas de Hidalgo (UMSNH) in Morelia, Mexico.
              Organized by Dr. Marleigh Sheaff of the U. of Wisconsin, Madison, together with
              Professor Luis Villasenor, Director of the Institute of Physics at UMSNH, the
              goal of this first workshop is to encourage instrumentation skills by
              developing country physicists at their home institutions, and to foster
              collaboration between U.S. physicists at an early stage in their careers with
              their peers from elsewhere in the world.  It is expected that this first
              workshop will lead to a regular series of workshops/schools at the new Center
              for Instrumentation, which will provide researchers from the hemisphere with
              instrumentation skills useful for particle, nuclear, medical and other
              subdisciplines of physics
