Title:		"Subsidy Request for Workshop on the Role of Geotechnical
              Physical Modeling in Education"
NSF funding will be used to subsidize a
              one-day Workshop on the Role of Geotechnical Physical Modelling in Education,
              to be held on Tuesday, July 9, 2002, to precede the International Conference on
              Physical Modelling in Geotechnics in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada.  The
              Workshop will be organised by: Deborah J. Goodings (PI, and Professor at the
              University of Maryland) and Dr. Ryan Phillips (Senior Key Personnel, and
              Geotechnical Director and Associate Professor at Memorial University, Canada). 
              The goal of the Workshop is to educate attendees on the opportunities to
              integrate physical modelling research as it is conducted into education at the
              K-12 level, into education at the undergraduate level, and with increasing
              coverage into graduate level education.  The workshop is relevant to educators
              with modelling facilities in their home institutions, as well as to those
              without modelling facilities, and it will provide an excellent and timely
              opportunity for teachers, academics, and potential employers to consider the
              role of geotechnical physical modelling in education.  With NSF support, the
              workshop can be open to any attendee without charge.  In addition, travel
              subsidies will be provided to senior graduate students and junior faculty from
              US universities to attend the Workshop, with particular attention to
              encouraging women and underrepresented minorities to attend.
