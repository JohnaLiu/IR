Abstract    :
              The proposed research studies the interaction between dynamical
systems and
              geometry.  Work of Furstenberg, Mostow and Margulis
shows that understanding
              certain dynamical systems is an
important tool in the study geometric
              properties of symmetric and
locally symmetric spaces. .  One important
              property of symmetric
spaces is that they have non-positive curvature. 
              The
investigator plans to extend this work in several
              inter-related
directions.  The study of symmetric spaces will be generalized
              to
include more general spaces of non-positive curvature as well as
more
              general maps between symmetric spaces.  This raises the
possibility of purely
              dynamical applications. The group of
diffeomorphisms of a compact manifold
              acts on the space of
square-integrable Riemannian metrics, which is naturally
              an
infinite-dimensional space of non-positive curvature.  The
investigator
              will attempt to exploit these relationships to prove
long-standing conjectures
              of Zimmer.

Dynamical systems is an important and relatively young field
              of
mathematics that investigates the evolution of physical or
mathematical
              systems over time (e.g. fluid flow).  New ideas from
dynamical systems theory
              such as chaos and fractals have had a
profound impact on our perception of the
              world.  One of the
deepest and most influential mathematical applications
              of
dynamical systems has been the study of geometric properties of
spaces
              with "many symmetries".  The proposed research will extend
our understanding
              of this deep connection between geometry and
dynamics.
