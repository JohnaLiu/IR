Abstract    :
              A workshop on the future directions of probability will be held in Arlington,
              Virginia, May 29-31, 2002. The purpose of the workshop is to discuss the future
              of probability, both as a discipline and as a component of research in other
              areas of science and engineering. Participants in the workshop will include
              prominent researchers in probability theory, as well as researchers at the
              boundaries of probability with other areas. A general interest paper is
              expected to be generated by the workshop participants and disseminated widely.
