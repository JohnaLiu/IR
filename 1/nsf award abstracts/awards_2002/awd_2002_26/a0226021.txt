Abstract    :
              The proposal deals with models and experiments to study microporosity in
              casting.  The goal is to understand how microstructure formation is influenced
              by microporosity growth and convective flow of an alloy liquid phase.  Three
              distinct tasks have been laid out.  The first is to use a phase field method to
              simulate the interaction among dendritic growth, microporosity formation and
              melt flow.  These results will be coupled into a macroscopic model for
              predicting microporosity nucleation, growth, agglomeration, and migration. 
              Finally, experiments will be conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to
              provide data for validation of the predictions.  If successful, the research
              will contribute to the fundamental understanding of microporosity formation. 
              The computer codes to be developed could be used by commercial casting code
              developers to improve the modeling capability with respect to this important
              element of solidification processing.  The present award will concentrate on
              the microscale modeling of microporosity formation and on developing the
              methodology for coupling this model with a macroscopic model.  Planning for
              validation experiments will also be carried out, in anticipation of a future
              extensive collaboration with ORNL.
