CADRE: NETwork-computer for Computer Architecture Research and
              Education (NETCARE)

This award provides support for NETCARE
              (NETwork-computer for Computer Architecture Research and Education), an
              infrastructure supporting a repository of computer architecture tools, to be
              managed by a consortium of three universities:  Purdue University, University
              of Wisconsin and Northwestern University.  NETCARE will use the PUNCH network
              computing software developed at Purdue University, to provide the user
              interface, manage the repository of architecture tools, and perform high-level
              scheduling and dedicated resource access control. Condor, a resource management
              system that uses idle CPU cycles of networked workstations, developed at the
              University of Wisconsin, will be used to perform low-level scheduling and
              management of resources. NETCARE will be universally accessible through
              conventional World Wide Web browsers and will provide software tools and
              computing resources for the computer architecture research and education
              community.
