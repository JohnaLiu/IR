Abstract    :
              This Services project is developing a web-based, searchable and browsable
              database tool to capture information about the goals, ongoing activities,
              deliverables, schedules, development stages and discipline areas covered by
              NSDL projects. It is cooperatively populated by the NSDL community and
              organized by its shared vision. To implement the Collaboration Finder the
              project is working with the NSDL Community Services Standing Committee to
              facilitate its use by the existing collections, services, and targeted research
              track projects. Close coordination with the Core Integration team is being
              maintained so as to inform the development of this key component of NSDL.
              Evaluation of the benefits of this service includes outcome measures such as
              frequency and type of usage of the Collaboration Finder by different groups of
              NSDL participants and constituents, the number and type of new activities
              generated through use of the Collaboration Finder, and the effectiveness and
              efficiencies in developing successful collaborations among current and
              prospective NSDL projects.
