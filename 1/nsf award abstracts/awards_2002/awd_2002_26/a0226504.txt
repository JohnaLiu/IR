Research on surface
              reconstruction has prospered by productive interactions between
              computational
geometers and classical topologists. The initial reconstruction
              techniques on unorganized point
data relied upon visual inspection to verify
              topological correctness. Recent advances have led to
rigorous sufficient
              conditions that guarantee correct topological form first, by equivalence
              under
homeomorphisms and subsequently by the stronger ambient isotopy. These
              theoretical advances
have led to improved surface reconstructions for reverse
              engineering and medical modeling for a
significant subset of the surfaces
              considered in those applications. This prompts a speculative
unifying
              intellectual question: Can contemporary modifications of classical difierential
              geometry,
topology and knot theory lead to a broader scope for computational
              topology that will result in
further algorithmic improvements? More
              specifically, can these classical mathematical tools be
applied to extend the
              domain of surface reconstruction algorithms? This research will explore
how
              this already successful synergy between classical mathematics and computer
              science can be
accelerated. Graduate student support is requested and this
              successful project outcome will then
serve as an exemplar for further student
              involvement in interdisciplinary work between computer
scientists and
              mathematicians.
