The explosion and subsequent nuclear fire ar the Chernobyl
              nuclear reactor in 1986 led to one of the largest scale human-induced
              ecological disasters ever. Vast amounts of highly radioactive materials,
              estimated to be in the range of 50-200 million curies, were spread widely
              across the Eastern European landscape, and the northern lands of Ukraine will
              remain contaminated for tens of thousands of years to come.The regions
              surrounding the power plant were heavily contaminated by radioactive fallout. A
              considerable increase has been reported in thyroid cancer, childhood leukemia,
              chromosomal aberrations, and the frequency of congenital malformations and
              microsatellite instability in human populations around Chernobyl and
              Belarus.

In collaboration with scientists at the French Centre National de
              Researche Scientifique (CNRS), The University of Extramadura in Badajoz, Spain,
              and the National Museum of Natural History in Kiev, Ukraine, we will
              investigate the effect of radioactive contaminants on a common bird species of
              Europe, the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica. We will compare morphological
              asymmetry, immunological assays, visible mutations (e.g., albinism), and
              mutations in microsatellite DNA and in the p53 genes (a gene often associated
              with cancers in human), as well as measure rates of offspring survival to
              fledging, in swallows living in the fallout area vs. in swallows living in
              uncontaminated areas. Because barn swallows most often occur in association
              with human habitation, this species is accessible for scientific study and can
              also serve as a model for studying the potential long-term effects of
              radioactive contamination on wildlife and human populations.
