Abstract    :
              
This collections project builds on the earlier successes of the web site,
              www.eskeletons.org, and
dramatically expands the range of content at the site,
              the degree of student interactivity with the
materials, and the amount of
              student interaction with each other. New laser scanning equipment
along with
              dramatic improvements in existing high resolution X-ray computed tomography
              technologies allows the inclusion of species of a much smaller body size than
              those initially posted at the site, with the completion of the scans
              accomplished on a much faster timetable. This site provides students with a
              more complete understanding of the range of primate diversity and  facilitates
              a great diversity of lab exercises.

Additions to the site include: 1) an
              expansion of the range of content including additional species, larger samples
              of particular species, and case studies that illustrate specific points,
              including forensic studies, and the option for researchers to post their
              datasets, 2) multiple entry portals that are age-specific and include separate
              portals for grade, college, and Gray learners, a "collaboratorium" link to
              serve as a clearinghouse for bringing together classrooms and instructors from
              different parts of the country,  a series of tools and exercises that examine a
              variety of biological concepts and topics, 3) expansion of the current
              self-quizzing
feature and the incorporation of prepared curriculum materials,
              PowerPoint presentations, and
classroom exercises that can be downloaded by
              instructors for use in the classroom, 4) 3-D hard copy printouts to explore the
              use of anatomically accurate models at various scales as teaching tools, with a
              special emphasis on identification kits and comparative anatomy, 5) versions of
              the web site that can be downloaded
for remote use on laptops and handheld
              PDAs, and 6) conformity with the NSDL Core Integration effort.
