Abstract    :
              The proposal requests funding for partial support for the Advanced Study
              Institute (ASI) on Techniques and Concepts of High Energy Physics, June 13-24,
              2002. The ASI aims to advance the training and instruction of exceptional young
              physicists in current experimental techniques and theoretical developments. It
              will also enhance contacts between the leading scholars from different
              countries and the young physicists. The funds will be used to cover the costs
              of travel and accommodations for speakers.
