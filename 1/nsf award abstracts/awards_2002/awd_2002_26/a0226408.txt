Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to bring together young and experienced college
              faculty to encourage scholarship in the teaching of computational linguistics. 
              This would take place in a workshop on "Effective Tools And Methodologies For
              Teaching Natural Language Processing And Computational Linguistics" to be held
              during the annual conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics
              on July 7, 2002 in Philadelphia, PA.   The workshop will enable new and
              prospective computational linguistics faculty to learn from their peers and to
              share resources related to teaching NLP and CL.
