Abstract    :
              This NSDL Targeted Research project is studying the use of networked digital
              resources by secondary school science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
              (STEM) teachers as they seek and select quality materials and tailor them to
              fit the learning environment of their classroom. Areas of interest
              include:
characterizing the use of digital resources for preparing lessons and
              for incorporating materials directly into student projects; and investigating
              types of software tools, lesson templates, and support that enable teachers to
              integrate digital library resources into general classroom settings. A
              combination of surveys, interviews, and observations are being employed, and
              the results are informing a general framework for the identification of
              specific services and tools for the broad audience of secondary school STEM
              teachers.
