The Second Joint Meeting of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine
              and Biology Society (EMBS) and the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) occurs
              in Houston, Texas, October 23-26, 2002. The technical program of the meeting
              includes the 3 mini-symposia of Biomedical Optics, Magnetic Resonance Imaging,
              and Terahertz Bioimaging and Biosensing Applications. Funding is being provided
              to support the participation of 8 young investigators who will give featured
              30-minute presentations in the special mini-symposia on the topics New
              Technologies in Biomedical Optics, Recent Advancces in Magnetic Resonance
              Imaging, and Terahertz Bioimaging and Biosensing. 
 
The intellectual merit
              of the 3 mini-symposia is high: the topics chosen for discussion represent new
              areas of investigation in Biomedical Optics and Imaging and are to be described
              by new investigators at the forefront of their respective fields. The
              mini-symposia will add significantly to the scientific quality of the Joint
              Conference, which currently represents the largest professional forum for
              Bioengineers worldwide. The information presented will have broad impact in the
              fields of biosensors, BioMEMS, medical imaging, and the areas of applied
              research that depend on such emerging technologies. 

Each recipient of
              support is expected to submit a report outlining their exciting new findings
              and their scientific experiences at the Conference.
