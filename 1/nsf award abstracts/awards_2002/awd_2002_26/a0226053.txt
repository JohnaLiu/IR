Digital Government and
              E-Rulemaking: New Direction for Technology and Regulation

Rulemaking is the
              process by which government agencies take laws passed by Congress, provide the
              detailed scientific, engineering, and economic analyses necessary to reduce
              those laws to regulation and practice, and then consult with any interested
              parties.  They must then consider any external recommendations and accept or
              reject them. Documenting their reasons for doing so.  The entire process and
              decisions must be open and transparent.

Many Federal agencies have begun
              experimenting with using the Internet in the rulemaking process.  The hope is
              that this will increase the accessibility of the process to the public, while
              providing an easier way to document the interactions between the agencies and
              the public.

This proposed workshop will bring together information
              technology researchers, legal and administrative experts, and agency personnel
              to develop an information technology and social/political science research
              agenda related to this very important democratic process.
