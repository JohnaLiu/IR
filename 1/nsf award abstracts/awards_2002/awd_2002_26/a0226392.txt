Abstract    :
              VOLCANIC ERUPTION MECHANISM MODELING WORKSHOP

EAR-0226392
PI: Sahagian

We
              will convene an international workshop to bring together the growing community
              of volcanic eruption modelers with experimentalists and field volcanologists to
              accomplish two specific goals: 1) Ensure that modelers are provided the most
              up-to-date values of magmatic parameters from recent experimental results and
              observations; and 2) Establish a standardized set of model "experiments" with
              identical magma and conduit characteristics and a common protocol to assure
              that model results can be subsequently meaningfully compared and evaluated. The
              specific objectives of the workshop will be to produce a standard set of
              parameters and a set of model "experiments" to be performed by the all models.
              Representatives from the modeling groups are expected to perform the full suite
              of model runs, providing the specific set of output required by the standard
              protocol. The results will be subsequently compiled and evaluated to determine
              the sources of differences in model output. The results of the model runs will
              presented at a special session of the joint AGU-EGS-EUG meeting in April 2003.
              It is expected that a synthesis of this model intercomparison activity will
              lead to identification of a number of critical conceptual, experimental, and
              observational gaps, and the production of a "Community Model," which can be
              used for future development and direct comparison with newly acquired
              observations. As these are brought to light, the research community can most
              effectively move forward to address these gaps in subsequent research within
              the experimental and observational, as well as modeling sectors.
