Abstract    :
              
Fast-paced environmental changes currently threaten bird populations. To
              predict how birds will respond to these changes it will be essential to acquire
              new knowledge about environmental influences on individual reproductive
              decisions (e.g., whether, where, and when to reproduce) and how organisms
              respond to their environments as physiological and behavioural systems.  While
              some species are flexible with respect to laying date, clutch size, mating
              system, etc., others are less flexible.  If scientists are to predict which
              populations will be able to adjust or adapt and how rapidly, they will require
              far greater knowledge of the mechanisms underlying reproductive decisions than
              they currently possess.

Obtaining that knowledge will require the expertise
              of reproductive endocrinologists, physiological ecologists, behavioral
              ecologists, comparative biologists, population biologists, and quantitative
              geneticists (or, more simply, endocrinologists and ecologists). 

This award
              will support an exploratory workshop that will convene ~30 European and North
              American scientists. The workshop will foster the exchange of knowledge,
              techniques, and data between endocrinologists and ecologists to address this
              pressing and topical issue. It will lead in turn to the formation of a research
              network that will foster international collaborations and opportunities for
              international training of graduate and postdoctoral students including students
              from groups underrepresented in science and developing countries.
