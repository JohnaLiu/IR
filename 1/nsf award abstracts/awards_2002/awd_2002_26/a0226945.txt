This U.S.-Mexico award will support Prof. Joseph Haus of the
              University of Dayton (UD) in a research collaboration with Dr. Evgeni Kuzin of
              the Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica Optica y Electronica (INAOE) in Puebla,
              Mexico.  The researchers intend to work on experimental and theoretical
              approaches to develop fiber devices and characterization techniques. The
              project will also explore potential applications for the optical communications
              industry and medical imaging technology. 

The researchers at UD aim to carry
              out a theoretical investigation of Raman amplifiers in birefringent optical
              fibers while the researchers at INAOE will construct a Raman logic gate using
              the modelocked fiber laser developed through previous joint research.  The
              theoretical investigation will elucidate characteristics of the logic gate and
              its potential use with solitons. The modeling will support measurements of
              Raman amplification for a fiber span consisting of standard, zero dispersion
              and non-zero dispersion shifted fiber to determine the optimal interaction
              length between pump pulses and signal pulses. The Office of International
              Science and Engineering and the Division of Electrical and Communication
              Systems of NSF will contribute funds for this collaboration.
