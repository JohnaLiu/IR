Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

The ten largest freshwater lakes hold nearly two-thirds (62%) of the
              planet's surface fresh water. These and other large lakes are already important
              sources of fresh water for society that may be tapped for greater withdrawals
              in the coming century. Large lakes are also invaluable national resources for
              transportation, tourism, recreation, commercial fisheries and food production,
              and they are increasingly stressed by regional development. Most of these lakes
              are unique, complex ecosystems whose dynamics differ from both oceans and small
              lakes. Despite the importance and uniqueness of large lakes throughout the
              world, the current level of NSF funding for these aquatic systems is
              surprisingly small. We propose to hold a workshop that will develop a science
              and implementation plan for basic research on large lakes. A report will be
              produced that will define the rationale for this research, outline some of the
              current pressing questions, identify the needs of the research community, and
              provide advice to NSF for the future management of great lakes proposals.
