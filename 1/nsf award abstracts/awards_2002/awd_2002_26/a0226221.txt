This award provides
              partial support for preparation and targeted dissemination of a special issue
              of the ACM SIGCSE Bulletin--a special issue on "Women and Computing".  Women
              are significantly underrepresented in computing and this funding supports
              dissemination of the special issue to K-12 teachers attending the National
              Educational Computing Conference (NECC) at which K-12 teachers represent a
              large segment of the attendees.  This particular audience is believed to be
              very important in helping to inform students at a relatively early age of the
              opportunities in this field.  Further, it is expected that the availability of
              this special issue to this particular group may have the potential in the long
              term to begin to help alleviate the problem of underrepresentation of women in
              this field. Volunteers at the conference disseminate the free issues to the
              K-12 teachers from the ACM exhibit booth.  The Editor-in-Chief of the SIGCE
              newsletter and the two ACM-W Co-chairs oversee the dissemination. 

Other
              copies of the special issue are being distributed to university department
              chairs, to attendees at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, to
              ACM Special Interest Group (SIG) Chairs, and to a number of ACM sponsored
              conferences.  These latter dissemination efforts are being carried out with
              support from the ACM Executive Committee and a number of other ACM groups,
              including the ACM Council, ACM-W, and the SIG Project Fund.
