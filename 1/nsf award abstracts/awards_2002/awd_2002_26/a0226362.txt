Nanoscience and nanotechnology have emerged as major
              national goals as evidenced by the requested FY 2002 federal budget.  The Earth
              science community has clearly identified nanoscience in the environment as an
              emerging field (National Academy of Sciences BROES report, Jordan et al. 2001).
               Earth science researchers have recognized the potential importance of studies
              of nanophase materials and have begun to develop specific research targets. 
              Accordingly, this award will co-fund (with the National Research Council) an
              invitational workshop of approximately 50 people to assess the opportunities
              and challenges in the field, as well as the pertinent connections between
              nanogeoscience and more traditional chemical or materials-based nanoscience,
              and write a report of no more than 15 pages in the course of a 2.5 day meeting
              in June 2002 at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
