Abstract    :
              The University of Tennessee - Knoxville, will conduct a workshop to explore the
              feasibility and interest in creating a Digital Rights Management (DRM) Content
              Forum.  
	
DRM refers to the management of intellectual property and
              distribution of digital content, and is critical to the research and education
              enterprise.   Questions of access,  fair use, collaboration, unique R&E
              requirements in DRM and so forth are very important to the R&E community.   
              The NSF Middleware Initiative DRM workshop will bring together experts and
              stakeholders for the middleware, content management, and intellectual property
              management communities to address these questions and explore means of
              cooperatively developing DRM solutions for research and education. 

The
              workshop has identified four deliverables; 
- launch of the NMI Digital
              Content Forum (establishment of membership and
