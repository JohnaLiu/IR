This one-year award for U.S.-U.K. dissertation enhancement
              research in novel materials involves Ms. Shelley Gilliss, a graduate student
              and Ms. Nicole Munoz, an undergraduate student in materials science at the
              University of Minnesota.  Both students will travel to University of Oxford to
              participate in research in glasses and ceramic oxides under the guidance of the
              US investigator, Dr. C. Barry Carter and his U.K. counterpart,  John L.
              Hutchison.  Ms. Gilliss will iinvestigate interactions in the materials system,
              cerium oxide and silicate glass, cerium oxide and glass-ceramics. Glass/oxide
              interactions play a critical role in a variety of processes, from liquid-phase
              sintering to chemical-mechanical polishing of glass.    She will use scanning
              electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and transmission electronic
              microscopy to elucidate the chemistry, structure, dimensions and morphology of
              these materials. The project takes advantage of British expertise in microscopy
              in general and specifically in high-resolution microscopy of oxides and
              glasses.
