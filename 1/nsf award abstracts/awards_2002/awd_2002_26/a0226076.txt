Abstract    :
              SRF cavities in high energy accelerator application are very costly to produce,
              at $44,000 per meter, however the reduced operating costs with these cavities
              creates the need to investigate means of producing these cavities in new and
              efficient fashion. This SGER aims to consider the deposition of textured
              niobium films on molybdenum structures by electron beam assisted PVD. The
              modification of the PVD adds addition process driver that can be used to
              produce higher quality conforming thin films.  This is a high potential
              proposal considering the applications, and the advantage that would be gained
              if these SRF cavities could be produces in quantity and lower cost. The high
              risk is related to the uncertainty of producing relatively defect-free Nb
              films, where surface defects and grain boundaries would be extremely
              deleterious. 

This exploratory research will test the feasibility of
              creating these films on the moldy substrates, exploring the processing issues
              related to high performance thin films. If this proof of principle can be
              established, then further research will be needed to determine optimization
              conditions for high quality film producibility.  The PIs will include
              undergraduate research assistants on this program through REUs. A subaward to
              Penn State will provide the necessary materials characterization capability and
              the collaboration will give students a chance to visit / conduct research at
              either campus
