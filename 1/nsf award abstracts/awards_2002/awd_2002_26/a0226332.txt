Abstract    :
              This NSDL Services project is creating turn-key software for collection
              developers to manage their organizing and cataloging tasks and to create and
              share item-level metadata. In addition a digital library workflow management
              knowledge archive is under development. The project complements the work of the
              NSDL Core Infrastructure (CI) team as it harvests and integrates collection
              records into the NSDL Metadata Repository so that users may conduct in-depth
              searches for items across diverse science, technology, engineering, and
              mathematics education collections. The impact of these services promises to
              have broad reach across a spectrum of educational levels.
