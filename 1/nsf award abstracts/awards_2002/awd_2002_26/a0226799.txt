Abstract    :
              

Capacitively actuated and sensed microcantilever arrays have great promise
              as a basic micro-electro-mechanical device.  We investigate novel dynamics and
              controls inspired schemes for overcoming two major problems inherent in such
              devices.  We propose to use current measurements in an indirect sensing sensing
              scheme by using a dynamical model of the cantilever to build a state estimator
              for measuring cantilever displacement, thus avoiding the potentially corrupting
              secondary sensing signal now commonly used.  We also propose to build and
              control tightly coupled arrays of such cantilevers where the significant
              inter-cantilever coupling is compensated for (rather than avoided) by using
              distributed feedback loops.
