Abstract    :
              This project will develop a new digital receiver for medium frequency (MF) radio
              emissions that are present in the Earth's auroral zones.  A study of the
              feasibility of moving the MF Interferometer from Sondrestrom, Greenland to a
              site an auroral site in Alaska where complementary data from optical images
              would be available.  In addition to the instrument development and planning,
              the project will investigate the theoretical aspects of auroral MF radio
              emissions.  These studies will make use of data being collected at several
              auroral sites in Canada, Greenland, and Alaska.
