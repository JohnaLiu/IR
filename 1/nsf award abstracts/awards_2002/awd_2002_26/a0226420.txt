Abstract    :
              The Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) will carry out a
              small one-time award program to encourage collaborative activities in global
              change research among scientists and institutions of the IAI member countries. 
              The Small Grants Program (SGP) will be the foundation of a second phase of IAI
              programmatic development, leading to the establishment of new long term
              research networks that will succeed the current Collaborative Research Network,
              supported in part by a separate NSF grant. High priority has been given in this
              selection to high-quality science and the participation of new/young scientists
              from IAI member countries.
After an open call and a merit-based peer-review
              the IAI has selected the following activities:
