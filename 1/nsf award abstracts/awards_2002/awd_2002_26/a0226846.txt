Abstract    :
              The establishment of a new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
              (I/UCRC) at the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Arizona State
              University focuses on Telecommunication Circuits and Systems for the
              advancement of the next generation of telecommunication systems.  The objective
              of the Center is to establish a cooperative research center for Arizona State
              University researchers and industry partners to work together on the
              advancement of integrated circuits and systems for telecommunication by
              identifying new technologies that will enable "system-on-a-chip" communication
              devices.

The I/UCRC will comprise three major initiatives:  Research,
              Internship, and Curriculum development.  Research initiatives will provide
              consortium partners a complete spectrum of expertise in Telecommunications, RF
              Design, Wireless and Wireline communications, optical electronics, and
              analog/digital integrated circuits.  The research roadmap of the center will be
              conceived  and executed by the Center industrial Partners and will be monitored
              and evaluated by the Industrial Advisory Board.
