Abstract    :
              The PI is organizing the 4th Winter School J.J. Giambiagi titled "Nanophysics,
              Nanoscience and Nanotechnology."  This meeting will take place at the
              University of Buenos Aires in Argentina.  Support is requested for 1.5 graduate
              students from U.S. Institutions.  This interdisciplinary program is to provide
              a forum for discussion of the latest advances in the general nano area and to
              foster collaboration between the scientists in  U.S. and Argentina.  The
              challenges and issues with science and application of nanotechnology will be
              identified and discussed along with identification of emerging areas requiring
              research and analysis.
