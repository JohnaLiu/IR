Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT


This award provides partial support for travel of young
              researchers (advanced graduate students, post doctoral researchers and very new
              faculty) to attend the First International School and Conference on
              Nanoscale/Molecular Mechanics to be held in Maui, Hawaii from May 12-17, 2002. 
              The school will be held two days prior to the conference.  A panel of
              distingushed lecturers has been selected to make presentations.  Many of the
              pioneers in nanoscale mechanics will make presentations at the conference.
