This award supports mainly graduate students and junior faculty
              from US universities to participate in a workshop on geometric function theory
              at the University of Jyvaskyla in Finland, June 16-19, 2003.  The workshop will
              focus on three main themes:  Analysis in Metric Spaces, Potential Theory in
              Metric Spaces, and Mappings of Finite Distortion.  Those topics are the focus
              of research by a wide range of mathematicians from across the globe.  This
              award will support travel by eight graduate students and seven junior
              researchers and is designed to stimulate international contacts that will lead
              to future collaborations.  The University of Jyvaskyla will publish a
              proceedings of the workshop which will include submitted papers, problem sets
              from the workshop sessions, as well as summaries of the sessions.  The Math
              Department at the University of Cincinnati will host a web site to disseminate
              the information and to facilitate communication among those interested in the
              workshop.
