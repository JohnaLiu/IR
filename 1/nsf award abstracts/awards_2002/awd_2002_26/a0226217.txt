Abstract    :
              This Targeted Research project is investigating a model for integrating content
              from NSDL into online and web-enhanced courses in higher education. The
              project's first user community and testbed are the students and faculty at the
              Texas A&M Electronic Teachers College (ETC). CollegisEduprise is supplying its
              iLumina digital library infrastructure and its experience with metadata tagging
              of learning resources to facilitate the integration of Texas A&M University
              System learning objects into the NSDL. Services under development include
              mapping of modular learning object content to teacher certification
              competencies in high area needs such as mathematics; defining competency-based
              metadata vocabularies for these learning objects that reflects the teacher
              certification requirements; and creating a Content-Packaging Tool Suite to
              enable faculty to select learning objects from a repository, build them into
              learning modules, and connect them into course-management systems or other
              delivery platforms. These services are being designed and implemented in a
              generalizable way to enable effective integration into the NSDL and sharing
              with others who want competency-tagged learning materials and tools to
              construct learning modules from them.
