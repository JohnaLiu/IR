Abstract    :
              This project consists of two experiments aimed at testing fundamental symmetries
              of nature using spin magnetometers. The first experiment will set new limits on
              violation of time-reversal symmetry by searching for a permanent Electric
              Dipole Moment (EDM) using liquid 129-Xe. It will constrain new sources of T and
              CP violation caused by Supersymmetry and other extensions of the Standard
              Model. The current best limit on EDM of a diamagnetic atom comes from the
              199-Hg experiment and is limited by  statistical noise. Using liquid Xe we will
              be able to increase the number of atoms by eight orders of magnitude and the
              electric field strength by a factor of 10 relative to the latest version of the
              199-Hg experiment.  SQUID magnetometers will be used for detection of spin
              precession and for monitoring leakage currents. The limits on CP violation can
              be improved by 2 to 4 orders of magnitude.
The second experiment will set new
              limits on CPT violation and Lorentz symmetry violation by comparing the spin
              precession frequencies of 3-He and 39-K atoms contained in the same cell. CPT
              and Lorentz symmetry violations can occur in string theories and other theories
              of quantum gravity. The K magnetometer will operate at low magnetic field and
              high number density, eliminating relaxation due to spin exchange. We will use a
              new self-compensating design that takes advantage of the spin-exchange coupling
              between K and 3-He atoms, while automatically canceling magnetic field
              fluctuations and eliminating many systematic effects typically limiting atomic
              spin magnetometers. We expect to improve the existing limits by 2-3 orders of
              magnitude.
