Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

The project is developing a web-based assessment
              tool around WebStat statistical software. The resulting web site, DoStat.com,
              allows instructors to easily develop data analysis exercises and administer the
              resulting assessments to their students. The student takes the assessment in a
              format that seamlessly integrates the data set to be analyzed with the software
              to analyze it. The project is effectively solving the problems associated with
              delivering important data analysis exercises to introductory statistics
              students.
