Abstract    :
              
The Bering Sea supports some of the world's most productive fisheries, and
              acts as a chemostat, modifying water, heat and salt concentrations as they flow
              from the North Pacific Ocean to the Arctic Ocean. In recent years, it has
              become evident that this seasonally ice-covered sub-arctic sea is subject to
              decadal-scale and secular changes in climate. Thus, there is a need to assess
              how global change may affect the marine ecosystem of the Bering Sea and its
              ability to support productive fisheries. To assess the potential for developing
              a major research initiative that could focus on the most profitable approaches
              to these questions, it is proposed to conduct an international workshop, to be
              held in early September 2002. The goal of the workshop would be to identify and
              prioritize the most important research questions concerning the potential
              effects of global change on the sub-arctic marine ecosystem of the Bering Sea
              and to discuss innovative approaches to answering these questions. An important
              product of the workshop will be the development of an outline for the structure
              of a major research initiative to address these questions. This outline would
              provide the basis for inclusion of the wider sub-arctic research community in
              the development and implementation of a new Bering Sea research program.
