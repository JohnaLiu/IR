Abstract    :
              The "NSF Highlights" column is published monthly in The Journal of Chemical
              Education and serves to disseminate information about projects funded by the
              Division of Undergraduate Education of the National Science Foundation, improve
              the understanding of programs at the National Science Foundation, and encourage
              submission of proposals to programs at the National Science Foundation. This
              project involves the editing of the "NSF Highlights" column, and travel by the
              co-editor to the American Chemical Society national meetings to allow him to
              interact with the chemistry community and to note changes in the state of
              undergraduate education in chemistry.
