Abstract    :
              Sean Seymore, Department of Chemistry, Rowan University, is supported by the
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program. Seymore's
              research includes the synthesis and characterization of new metal-oxo and
              -nitrido complexes supported by sulfur-rich tripodal ligands. Ligands such as
              phenyltris((methylthio)methyl)borate (PhTt) and hydridotris(methimazolyl)borate
              (Tm) provide a "softer" ligand environment than the more common nitrogen or
              oxygen donor ligands. The change in ligand may result in enhanced reactivity or
              unusual electronic properties in the metal-oxo and -nitrido
              complexes.

Metal-oxo and -nitrido complexes are of interest as possible
              models of important reactive intermediates in catalysis, nitrogen fixation, and
              many other biological processes. Minority Research Planning Grants are intended
              to strengthen the proposal writing and planning capabilities of new
              investigators and to facilitate preliminary studies and other planning
              activities related to the research.
