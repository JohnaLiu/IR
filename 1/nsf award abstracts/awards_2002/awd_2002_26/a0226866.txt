Abstract    :
              The ACM Special Interest Group in Data Communications (SIGCOMM) will sponsor a
              one-day workshop on "Computer Networking: Curriculum Designs and Educational
              Challenges," August 20, 2002, preceding the annual ACM Sigcomm 2002 conference
              in Pittsburgh, PA.  The goal of the workshop is to bring together faculty from
              a broad spectrum of academic institutions, industry engineers and scientists,
              and others with an interest in education to discuss curriculum design and
              teaching practices in the field of computer networks.  The workshop will focus
              on (i) the development of model curricula for a first (undergraduate) course in
              networking, (ii) the evolution of graduate-level curricula in the area, and
              (iii) developing "hands-on" laboratory-based courses at the
              undergraduate/graduate level.  The workshop will provide an opportunity to
              discuss these and other related issues; to share viewpoints, experiences, and
              materials; and to learn what others are doing, and considering doing in the
              area.  The workshop will produce a report detailing the attendees'discussions
              and will serve as a springboard for future activity in the area.

This
              proposal requests funding to assist up to 20 United States-based faculty
              members to attend and participate in this workshop.  The awards will be
              primarily targeted at faculty from 4-year colleges and universities who would
              not otherwise have the funds to attend the workshop or ACM SIGCOMM 2002. 
              Particularly there is an interest in drawing faculty from 4-year college to the
              workshop.  Given that the workshop is targeted broadly at all faculty in the
              computer networking area (not just those with the research funds to attend
              SIGCOMM), the grant will help broaden the base of participants, and serve to
              make the workshop a truly community-wide event.
