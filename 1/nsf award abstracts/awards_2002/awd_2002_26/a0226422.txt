"Question Generation
              and Answering Systems R&D for Technology-Enabled Learning Systems"

This
              project involves bringing research and development leaders together across
              disciplines and the public and private sectors to identify promising research
              that addresses the challenge of incorporating question generation and answering
              capabilities into learning systems.  Advice from panels of experts from
              companies, universities, government research facilities, and others with unique
              related expertise will result in: 1) A comprehensive review of recent research
              on questioning and answer systems from multiple perspectives: psychology,
              cognitive science, computational linguistics, and information systems design;
              2) Telephone interviews with relevant researchers, program managers, and
              industry representatives; 3) Assimilation of the findings from tasks 1) & 2)
              into a preliminary report; 4) A workshop of acknowledged experts, researchers,
              developers, and implementers of question generation and answering systems to
              evaluate, discuss and contribute to the final report; 5) A final report that
              will synthesis the discussions from the workshop that can serve as a
              comprehensive and strategic view of the field which researchers, industry, and
              funding may use as a guide for developing and applying question and answer
              systems. This project addresses a critical need to raise awareness of research
              results, tools, and on-going programs and projects across research disciplines,
              industry efforts, and government funding organizations related to question
              generation and answering. The work combines the skills of many disciplines
              including information science, software engineering and design, and cognitive
              science.
