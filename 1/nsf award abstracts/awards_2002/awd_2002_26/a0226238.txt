Abstract    :
              This Collections project is aggregating educational materials associated with
              the 220 late 19th-century model machine elements designed for research and
              teaching by the founder of modern kinematics, Franz Reuleaux (1829-1905).
              Resources of the collection include still and navigable moving images of these
              kinematic teaching models; systematic descriptions, and historical and
              contemporary documents related to the collection of the mechanisms; computer
              simulations of mathematical relationships associated with the movements of the
              mechanisms, and sample teaching modules that employ the models and simulations
              in the classroom at the undergraduate, secondary and middle school levels. The
              use of physical models in teaching mathematics, science, and engineering is
              recognized as an important component of visual thinking, and as essential to
              the cognitive foundations of mathematical activity and in the transition to an
              algebraic description of functions. This project illustrates the fruitful
              marriage of museum quality physical artifacts with the potential of digital
              media, and enables a much broader audience to access the benefits of using the
              physical models than only those who can physically visit the resources.
