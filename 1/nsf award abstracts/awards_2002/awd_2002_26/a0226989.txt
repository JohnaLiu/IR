Abstract    :
              The New Jersey Math and Science Partnership (NJ-MSP) unites Rutgers, Rowan and
              Kean Universities with twelve school districts.   Eight of the districts were
              among thirty plaintiffs in New Jersey's 20-year-long Abbott vs. Burke
              litigation, and have recently benefited from remedies ordered by the state
              Supreme Court.  The twelve districts that come together within NJ-MSP are
              characterized as small- and medium-sized urban districts with poor,
              high-minority and low achieving student populations.  The partners' schools
              enroll over 75,000 students of whom 27% are African American and 31% are
              Hispanic.  

The goals of NJ-MSP are to:
1.  Increase achievement and reduce
              achievement gaps in science and mathematics for all preK-12 students in partner
              school districts by (a) working to develop and implement strategic plans for
              each district; (b) working to develop internal leadership structures and
              practices to carry out the strategic plans; and (c) providing well-designed,
              continuing professional development.
2.  Increase and sustain the number,
              quality and diversity of preK-12 teachers of mathematics and science in partner
              school districts by (a) providing potential teachers with experiences that will
              help them see teaching as an attractive career; (b) improving preservice
              teachers' content knowledge by reshaping university math and science courses;
              and (c) carrying out induction programs for new middle and high school
              teachers.
3.  Document outcomes by (a) analyzing changes in student
              achievement and (b) documenting project activities.
