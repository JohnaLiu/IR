Abstract    :
              This project presents a workshop for approximately 40 CS educators interested in
              incorporating Human-computer Interaction (HCI) into undergraduate CS curricula.
              The workshop is a four-day event with follow-up reflection meetings at SIGCSE
              2004 and 2005.

This workshop (a) exposes a representative group of CS
              educators to significant HCI issues, educational approaches, and classroom
              experiences; (b) disseminates implementations of the HCI core requirements in
              the ACM/IEEE Computing Curricula 2001; (c) facilitates opportunities for
              networking and team-building among CS educators; and (d) begins to address the
              weak HCI preparation among CS graduates in the US. The follow-up meetings will
              help strengthen connections among members of this community by reflecting on
              new issues, approaches, experiences, what has worked, and what hasn't.
