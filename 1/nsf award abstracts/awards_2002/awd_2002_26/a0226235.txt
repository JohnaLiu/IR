Abstract    :
              This is a project to implement and exploit a novel means of measuring plasma
              density profiles in the ionosphere using low-power, ground-based radar. The
              technique utilizes the Faraday rotation of radar signals coherently scattered
              by plasma irregularities. Measurements are made with a bistatic radar system
              located in this case at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory and at a remote site in
              Paracas, Peru. The Faraday rotation technique was demonstrated recently by the
              PI of this project, who was supported by a CEDAR grant for one year to
              investigate its feasibility. The objective of the current project is to measure
              electron density profiles in the equatorial E region in the latitude sector
              where the electrojet flows. Such profiles cannot be measured with the Jicamarca
              incoherent scatter radar because, paradoxically, of clutter generated by
              small-scale irregularities in the electrojet. Density profiles in the
              equatorial E region have been measured on a few occasions with sounding rockets
              but never before by remote sensing. Consequently, there is a poorly developed
              picture of the structure of the equatorial E region, particularly at night, and
              several experimental, theoretical, and modeling efforts in low latitude
              ionospheric physics are suffering as a result.
