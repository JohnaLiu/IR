Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative project with Kansas State University (Award No.
              0226157).

The investigators are creating a proof-of-concept demonstration of
              a new type of digital library for physics teaching.  The project brings
              together several long-standing research projects in digital video libraries,
              advanced distance learning technologies, and collaboration technologies, and
              nationally known experts in physics pedagogy and high-quality content.

The
              project builds on Carnegie Mellon University's Informedia Digital Video Library
              (see NSF Award Nos. 9411299, 9817496, and 0085834), which is addressing the
              problem of information extraction from video and audio content, and "synthetic
              interviews" of master physics teachers.  Synthetic interview technology creates
              an anthropomorphic interface into video of a person responding to questions. 
              Synthetic interviews based on videos of several master physics teachers will
              allow teachers to converse with knowledgeable experts about their classroom
              techniques and about how those techniques are related to contemporary issues in
              physics teaching.  Teachers will also be able to create personal synthetic
              interviews, which, in addition to providing a resource for other teachers, can
              become a virtual, "anytime, anywhere" tutor for students.

The project aims
              to produce a state-of-the-art system through which teachers can interact, both
              virtually and directly, with experts in physics teaching, cooperate to help
              each other become more effective teachers of physics, and develop advanced
              courses for their students.
