Abstract    :
              The 2000 IEEE International Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems will bring
              the researchers and educators from this country and elsewhere together to
              discuss new results in areas of electrical engineering.  The main topics are
              divided into ten areas.  They include: (1) Analog Circuits,  (2) Digital
              Circuits and Computer Arithmetic, (3) Programmable Logic, VLSI, CAD and Layout,
              (4) Communication Networks,  (5) Wireless Communication Systems, (6) Neural
              Networks and Control Systems, (7) Digital Signal Analysis and Processing, (8)
              Power and Energy Systems and Power Electronics (9) RF, Microwave and Optical
              Circuits and Systems and (10) Engineering Education.  

The funds will
              provide financial help for the students in terms of travel, lodging, and
              registration.  The time they spend at the Symposium will benefit them in
              education, provide industrial contacts for future employment and allow them to
              visit with educators from various universities.
