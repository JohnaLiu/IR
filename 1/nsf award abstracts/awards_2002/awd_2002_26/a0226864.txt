Title:		"Surface Blast Effects on Embankments and
              Dikes"

Abstract:

	This research deals primarily with surface blast
              effects on embankments, dikes and levees.  These geotechnical engineered type
              structures are used for many purposes, and an important use is for flood
              protection and control.  Hundreds of miles of embankments and levees exist for
              flood control in the country.

The research is specifically related to damage
              assessment of such structures from surface blasts (the typical terrorist
              scenario), and the utilization and improvement of such structures for security
              purposes.

	The most critical time for embankments and levees is during flood
              conditions.  Unlike many other natural disasters, floods occur routinely, and
              in any given year it is virtually certain flooding will occur in some parts of
              the country.  The breaching of a levee during a flood could cause large amounts
              of property damage and even loss of lives; especially near large metropolitan
              areas, e.g. New Orleans.  Unfortunately, it is also easiest to breach an
              embankment or levee with explosives during flood conditions.  

Small scale
              physical models will be tested, utilizing RPI's 100 g-ton geotechnical
              centrifuge.  Centrifuge modeling is extremely attractive as an experimental
              approach to the study of ground shock problems, and many such studies have been
              conducted.  Most of the previous research has been conducted on level ground,
              dry soil conditions and/or with embedded explosives - that is, not surface
              blasts.

	Centrifuge experiments will be conducted using a range of 50-100
              gravities.  The explosive charges will vary in weight from milligrams to one
              gram, and will be detonated using exploding bridge wires.  A one gram charge in
              a 100-gravity centrifuge experiment is equivalent to several tons of actual
              explosives.
