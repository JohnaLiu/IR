              	Anisotropic Thermal Transport in Fuel Cells

Abstract

The proposal deals
              with the coupling between anisotropic thermal transport and water management in
              PEM fuel cell membrane systems.  Water management is critical to the efficient
              operation of the fuel cell.  The proposed research will include measurements of
              the anisotropic thermal conductivity of the gas diffusion layer and the
              electrolyte, as well as the gas and surface temperature of a 5 cm2 operating
              fuel cell.  An analytical model will account for orthotropic thermal
              conductivity, as well as fluid mechanics, species transport, advection, and
              electrochemistry.  The results will have impact on fundamental understanding of
              anisotropic thermal transport, will address the critical water management
              issues for PEM fuel cells, and will serve to expose mechanical engineering
              students to a technology area often considered to be outside the
              discipline.
