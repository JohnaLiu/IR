This proposal will support the construction of large-scale
              computer models of the mammalian cerebellar cortex.  The models constructed
              will be realistic in the sense that they will include what is currently known
              of the anatomy and physiology of the neurons and networks of this structure. 
              Because the models are realistic, modeling results can be used to guide
              experimental investigations and help in the interpretation of new experimental
              results.  Although no funds are requested to support animal research in this
              grant, the results will be invaluable for making animal research more efficient
              and effective.   This modeling effort will also take place in the context of a
              fundamentally new theory of cerebellar cortical function recently proposed y
              the P.I., which has grown out of previous basic research efforts, funded in
              part by NSF.  Although the work to be performed in this study is basic science,
              the theory that has been proposed has already generating new ways to look at
              cerebellar dysfunction in human patients, and will shortly result in clinical
              trials for new means of detecting cerebellar deficits.  The modeling efforts to
              be supported here will almost certainly continue to produce new ways of
              thinking about the function of this important structure.
