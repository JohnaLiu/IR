Title:  A Computationally
              Efficient Approach to the Lagrangian Modeling of Bubbling Beds

This proposal
              is based on the assumption that there are valid scaling laws where a large
              bubbling fluidized bed, typical of industrial applications, can be scaled down
              to a bed with fewer particles?  based on this assumption, the PI proposes to
              using these scaling laws to simulate an equivalent system with fewer particles
              and thus save significant computational cost which is typically proportional to
              the number of particles in a Lagrangian-Eulerian approach.  Lagrangian
              simulations have several advantages and will be a very powerful tool in
              realistically modeling particulate flows if it is made computationally more
              tractable.  The objectives of this work are to verify the existence of such a
              scaling or 'similitude' by experiments and numerical simulations and to develop
              an appropriate numerical scheme for Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations.
