Abstract    :
              This Services project is building the capacity of the National Science,
              Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics Education Digital Library (NSDL) to
              serve learners with disabilities. Project activities are being led by the
              National Center for Accessible Media (NCAM), a joint effort of the Corporation
              for Public Broadcasting and WGBH. Through this project the NSDL is benefiting
              from and contributing to the national and international dialogue on access
              specifications for online learning resources to meet the needs of users with
              disabilities and to ensure interoperability of accessible content. Project
              deliverables include an automated evaluation tool that reports on a site's
              accessibility and guides users to relevant resources to address barriers to
              accessibility by people with disabilities; an integrated and comprehensive
              information resource with useful materials, tools, sample solutions, and
              demonstration models specific to challenges presented by math and science
              content; and a Working Paper on Access Specifications and Solutions that
              summarizes relevant approaches to access and interoperability from working
              groups within the IMS Global Learning Consortium, the W3C and the Dublin Core.
              NSF's Division of Human Resource Development is providing co-funding for this
              project in recognition of its importance to broadening access to the
              educational resources of the NSDL.
