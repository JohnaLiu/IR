Abstract    :
              This NSDL Services project is exploring how to increase the number and quality
              of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education learning objects
              by facilitating virtual communities of content developers. It is prototyping
              support services for collaborations of teachers and researchers who are
              developing learning objects in their discipline with an emphasis on open and
              non-proprietary materials. An open course application service provider (ASP)
              hosts the collaboration tools needed for each community. Services provided for
              all communities include a directory of open course projects, a collection of
              Web-based tools for student use, a consultant database to connect projects with
              skilled experts, and a set of licenses suitable for open course learning
              objects. The underlying concept of this project is rooted in the academic
              tradition of open sharing of ideas and results of scholarly inquiry. This
              project is enabling the NSDL to explore an infrastructure to support future
              content acquisition for its collections.
