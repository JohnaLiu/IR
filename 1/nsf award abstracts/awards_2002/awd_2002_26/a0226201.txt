Abstract:

This research conference, in recognition of the 40th
              anniversary of the Department of Statistics at Texas A&M University, brings
              together leading researchers in four theme areas of great current interest in
              statistical research: 1) Linear models and their generalizations, 2)
              bioinformatics and statistical genetics, 3) time series analysis, and 4)
              smoothing. The meeting features cutting edge presentations in these areas,
              stimulates cross-fertilization, and pays especial attention to the interaction
              of new researchers and students with established researchers. The conference
              offers a number of ways through which new researchers can participate,
              including poster sessions, roundtable discussions, and discussion sessions
              following the talks.
