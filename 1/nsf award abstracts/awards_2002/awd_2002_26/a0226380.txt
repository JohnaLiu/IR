Abstract    :
              This grant is a travel request to enable eleven US researchers to attend the VI
              Iberoamerican Conference on Phase Equilibria for Process Design (EQUIFASE
              2002). This meeting will be held from October 12 -16, 2002 in Foz de Iguazu,
              Brazil and is being organized by Professor Marcelo Castier (Universidad Federal
              do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and Professor Esteban Brignole
              (PALPIQUI, Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahia Blanca, Argentina).  The purpose
              of the VI Iberoamerican Conference on Phase Equilibria for Process Design
              (EQUIFASE 2002) is to share research results in the area of phase equilibrium
              and thermodynamics.  The conference organizers are anxious to include
              researchers from North America who traditionally have not attended this
              meeting. This travel grant will include full funding for two young researchers
              and partial funding for nine senior researchers. The proposal for this grant is
              a direct result of the Pan-American Workshop to Promote Collaboration in
              Chemical Engineering that was held in Rio de Janeiro in August 1998.
