Abstract    :
              This Targeted Research project is investigating the merger of the information
              retrieval (IR) and digital reference components of the National STEM Education
              Digital Library (NSDL). Combining these functions enables users to find answers
              to questions regardless if those answers come from documents in NSDL
              collections or experts accessible through the NSDL's virtual reference desk.
              The project is using large digital reference data sets of question/answer pairs
              with human judgments to create ontologies of questions. These ontologies
              supplement automatic question triage techniques to create an enhanced NSDL IR
              system. The project is also developing methodologies for the creation of
              inductive expert profiles to allow the enhanced IR system to route questions
              needing human intermediation quickly and effectively.
