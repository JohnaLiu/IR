Abstract    :
              
The objective of this project is to develop design and analysis tools for
              these highly nonlinear and complex fuel cell power systems. We will use control
              theory not only for feedback synthesis, but also to reveal fundamental limits
              of achievable performance, and to make architectural decisions at an early
              stage of system design. The tight integration of system components, and the
              strong interplay between electrochemistry, thermodynamics, and reactor
              kinetics, give rise to dynamic phenomena that cannot be understood with the
              physics of individual subsystems in isolation. The development of reduced-order
              models that capture these dynamic phenomena, and the design of feedback
              controllers that work in harmony with the inherent physical features of the
              fuel cell, are timely research directions that would dramatically improve
              dynamic performance. The PI's strong background in nonlinear control theory and
              ongoing collaboration with United Technologies Research Center will lead to
              significant improvements in transient performance for highly dynamic loads, and
              to reductions in the number of costly system components through rigorous
              analyses of design trade-offs, and advanced feedback and state estimation
              algorithms.
