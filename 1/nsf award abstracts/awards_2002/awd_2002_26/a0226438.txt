Abstract    :
              The 46th International Conference on Electron, Ion and Photon Beam Technology
              and Nanofabrication 2002, sponsored by the American Vacuum Society in
              cooperation with the Electron Device Society of IEEE and the Optical Society of
              America, to be held in Anaheim, CA on May 28-31, 2002 will provide a forum for
              scientific and technical exchange to advance the practice and progress of
              nano/microfabrication, electron and ion lithographies, particle beam optics,
              and forefront applications of nanofabrication.

The conference will enable
              students to present their research to a high-level international scientific
              community.  Students will observe how scientists and engineers exchange ideas
              and information at conferences, and they will hear first hand presentations of
              up-to-date research results in nanotechnology.  Students will make personal
              contacts and learn of employment opportunities.  In a special student
              breakfast, the conference organizers will describe to the attendees how the
              conference program is put together.
