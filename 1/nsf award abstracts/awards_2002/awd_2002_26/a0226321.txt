Abstract    :
              This Targeted Research project is investigating the use of spatial hypertext by
              digital library patrons to
build personal and shared annotated digital
              information spaces, and by digital library providers to organize,
annotate,
              and maintain collections of digital information. Spatial hypertext is a class
              of information
workspace in which users collect source materials as
              information objects in a set of two-dimensional spaces and imply attributes of
              and relationships between the materials via visual and spatial cues. The ease
              of expressing evolving interpretations makes spatial hypertext well suited for
              tasks where the task and materials (or the user's understanding of these)
              change over time. The PI and colleagues are extending an existing spatial
              hypertext system, the Visual Knowledge Builder, in the following areas: (1)
              suggestion-based methods supporting the incremental specification of metadata;
              (2) dialog generation for converting the visual interpretation that occurs in
              the workspace into metadata; and (3) history annotation, filtering, and editing
              for viewing how collections change over time. By expanding the means to create
              personal digital information spaces beyond textual modes into visual ones, this
              investigation promises to broaden the impact of the NSDL on users.
