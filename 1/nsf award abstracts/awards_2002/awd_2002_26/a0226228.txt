Abstract    :
              This NSDL Collections project is aggregating the many science and mathematics
              education resources developed through Federal funding, to make them easily and
              meaningfully accessible by teachers, parents, and students. It is also laying
              the groundwork for ensuring that future resource and materials development
              adheres to standard metadata schema and tagging practices, on which efficient
              and relevant search, navigation, and access to content rests. Specific
              activities include: i) creating metadata for legacy collections as well as new
              digital content via a content management system; ii) systematically reviewing
              Federally-supported web sites to identify resources not yet part of the NSDL;
              iii) building awareness among grantees of the value of compliance with emerging
              metadata standards and best metadata tagging practices; iv) developing a
              portfolio of collection access tools including personalization; and v) working
              with grantees to secure rights to archive mathematics and science education
              digital resources so they are not lost at the end of a grant period. The
              project team is working closely with the NSDL Core Integration effort to ensure
              interoperability with other NSDL collections and services. Federal agency
              programs that are the initial focus of this project include the NSF's various
              instructional and materials development programs and related efforts housed
              within the Division of Elementary, Secondary, and Informal Education and the
              Division of Undergraduate Education, and the Department of Education's Regional
              Laboratories and the Eisenhower Consortia. Progress on this project is also
              being shared with the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the
              Science.gov Alliance.
