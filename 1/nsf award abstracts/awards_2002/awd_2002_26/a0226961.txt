This three-year award for US-France collaboration in
              applied mathematics involves research teams at the University of Virginia and
              the Institut National pour la Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique
              (INRIA) in Rocquencourt and Sophia Antipolis, France.  Led by Irena Lasiecka in
              the US and Michel Bernadou in France, the researchers propose to study problems
              in the general area of control theory models described by partial differential
              equations.  The topics are related to stabilization and optimal control of
              dynamical shell models where control actions and sensing are implemented via
              smart materials technology.  These include piezoceramic or peizoelectric
              elements, magnetostrictive devices and rheological fluids. The theoretical
              analysis, with a focus on inverse type of estimates, will culminate with
              numerical algorithms and convergence analysis.  Two approaches to control
              modeling will be pursued.  The first, piezoelectric shell modeling, will be
              investigated by the French team.  This is complemented by US expertise in an
              approach based on piezoelectric patches attached to a curved wall.  These
              complementary approaches will lead to two different control models.

This
              award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and INRIA.  NSF
              will cover travel funds and living expenses for annual visits to France by the
              US investigator and graduate student. INRIA will support visits by French
              researchers to the United States. The project will advance understanding of
              control models and their applications to smart materials technology and
              materials engineering.
