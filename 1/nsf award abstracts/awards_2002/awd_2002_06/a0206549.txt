Abstract    :
              
Large scale movement patterns can influence the spatio-temporal occurrence
              of
size-structure within and between populations but few studies explicitly
              address how
these patterns affect interactions such as cannibalism and
              intraguild predation (IGP). The
dragonfly Anax junius is a species that
              migrates and often assumes the role of top-
predator in fishless ponds. These
              attributes make A. junius an ideal species for
addressing the influence of
              migration on population size structure and local
population/community
              dynamics. We outline experiments with A. junius and other co-
occurring
              odonate larvae evaluating these effects.
Section I tests: a) the effects of
              size variation on cannibalism in paired A. junius
larvae and the likelihood of
              cannibalism within and between cohorts of A. junius;
and b) the effects of
              size-structure and temperature, two seasonally variable
factors, on
              cannibalism in populations of A. junius larvae.
Section II tests the effects
              of population size-structure in a top predator (A. junius)
on: a) the survival
              of intermediate predators and shared prey in a three species
IGP system; and
              b) the relative contributions of density mediated interactions and
trait
              mediated interactions on risk reduction in a three species IGP system.
