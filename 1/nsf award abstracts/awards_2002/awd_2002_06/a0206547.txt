Abstract    :
              The dynamics and the stable isotope geochemistry of methane in wet, tropical
              forest soils are poorly understood, compromising our ability to predict rates
              of methane flux and 13 C exchange with the atmosphere. Quantifying the
              source/sink strength and * 13 C signature of methane flux is crucial if we hope
              to evaluate the role of the tropics in the global methane budget. In systems
              where redox fluctuates, such as wet tropical forest soils, variations in oxygen
              influence methane emissions by altering the balance between methanogenesis and
              methane oxidation. This study explores the effects of oxygen variations on
              methanogenesis, methane oxidation and 13 C exchange with the atmosphere.
              Patterns of methane flux and 13 C exchange will be documented across natural
              gradients of oxygen in the field. Sources and sinks of methane will be
              identified, both in soil and across the landscape, through gas concentrations
              and stable isotope analysis. A series of mechanistic laboratory experiments
              will be performed to explore the effects of oxygen variation on gross
              methanogenesis, methane oxidation and stable isotope fractionation. This study
              will advance our knowledge of the factors that regulate methane and 13 C flux
              from wet tropical forests to the atmosphere.
