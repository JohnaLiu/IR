Abstract    :
              Many of the kinds of inquiry activities that have become increasingly prevalent
              as
educational tools assume that certain basic understandings are in place,
              for example the
understanding that multiple variables may act simultaneously
              to codetermine an outcome.
Recent research, however, suggests instead that
              this and related forms of meta-level
understanding are hard-won cognitive
              achievements that require support if they are to
develop during the elementary
              and middle-school years and provide a needed foundation for
more advanced
              inquiry learning. The goal of the proposed project is to better understand
the
              basic cognitive skills that underlie inquiry learning and to examine how they
              develop.
As part of their science curriculum, middle-school students will
              engage in a 10-week
software-based inquiry curriculum under several different
              conditions offering different
kinds of cognitive support. Employing a
              microgenetic method, researchers will closely
observe development, maintenance
              and transfer of cognitive skills. The proposed work
stands to inform both the
              design and use of educational technology to support inquiry
learning, and in
              addition should help to provide a clearer conceptual base for
              teachers
regarding the cognitive goals of inquiry curricula. The project is
              situated at the
intersection of quadrant II and quadrant III in terms of the
              objectives identified in the
ROLE RFP.
