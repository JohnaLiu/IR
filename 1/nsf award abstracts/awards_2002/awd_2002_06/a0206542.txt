Abstract    :
              Biological invasions are recognized to be one of the greatest threats to
              natural
communities and biodiversity. A central question in the study of
              biological invasions is: Do
invasive species have certain attributes in common
              that contribute to their success while others
fail? Despite the importance of
              this issue, few empirical studies have systematically tested
potentially
              important traits or trait combinations, especially in aquatic systems. To
              address
variation in invasiveness, studying closely related and
              morphologically similar taxa should allow
us to identify relevant traits. A
              good system is the poeciliid fish Gambusia, where the differences
in
              geographic range and invasiveness are extreme. Differences in key ecological,
              life history, and
behavioral traits might account for the observed variation
              in invasiveness among Gambusia
species. We propose to examine how invasive and
              noninvasive Gambusia species might differ in
their: (1) life history responses
              to abiotic stress, (2) population-level responses to biotic stress,
(3)
              community function, (4) aggression levels, and (5) dispersal patterns. We
              expect that the
proposed work in combination with our previous experiments
              will provide valuable insights into
which key species-specific traits enhance
              the probability of success of species invading novel
communities.
