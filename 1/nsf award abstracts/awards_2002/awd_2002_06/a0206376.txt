Abstract    :
              Parasites draw nutrition directly from their hosts and adversely affect them
              in
many ways. Major workers in the ant species Pheidole dentata are
              susceptible to
parasitism by the phorid fly Apocephalus feeneri. Parasitism by
              the phorid is fatal for
the parasitized ant and previous work has shown that
              foraging majors will try to
conceal themselves when phorids are detected. In
              spite of this attempt to avoid
parasitism, a small percentage of majors are
              successfully parasitized by phorids. The
goal of this study is to examine
              changes of those parasitized majors by comparing
their behavior to that of
              non-parasitized nestmates. Equal numbers of parasitized and
non-parasitized
              majors will be marked in a colony and their behaviors observed using
standard
              ethogram techniques for the duration of the phorid's larval
              development.
Frequencies and sequences of behaviors in parasitized and
              non-parasitized majors
will be compared. To highlight the effect of parasitism
              on the specialized defensive
response of P. dentata, parasitized majors will
              be exposed to fire ants in the genus
Solenopsis. The outcome of these
              experiments will affect future ecological studies
with P. dentata and
              potentially bio-control efforts in other ant-phorid systems.
