The first planetary systems outside our own Solar
              System were detected about six years
ago. By now close to 100 extrasolar
              planets have been detected around nearby, solar-like
stars. These discoveries
              of extrasolar planets will no doubt lead to significant
improvements in our
              understanding of many processes related to planet formation, structure and
              evolution, as well as deeper questions such as the existence of
              extraterrestrial life in the Universe. The search for, and characterization of,
              extrasolar planets has nowbecome a top scientific priority both in Europe and
              in the United States.  This project will address a number of theoretical
              questions concerning the formation and evolution of planetary systems around
              other stars, including those in drastically different environments than the
              Sun, such as planets in dense star clusters or in orbits around collapsed
              objects like neutron stars. In particular, the dynamical stability and final
              fate of extrasolar planetary systems will be studied using supercomputing
              simulations that combine the techniques of orbital dynamics and numerical
              hydrodynamics. The consequences of dynamical interactions between planetary
              systems and their central stars (such as tidal interactions with 'hot
              Jupiters', or metallicity enhancements through 'planet consumption') will also
              be studied using a combination of stellar evolution and hydrodynamics
              calculations. All these questions are crucial to our theoretical interpretation
              of the new observational data on extrasolar planets.
