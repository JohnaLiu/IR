Abstract    :
              A central goal of biology is to understand how organisms adapt to their
              environment.  This project seeks to clarify the constraints imposed on
              adaptation in plants by the alternation of morphologically distinct haploid and
              diploid generations in their life cycles.  If traits in the two generations are
              controlled by the same suite of genes, as populations adapt, these traits
              should change in a correlated fashion.  This project will utilize a bryophyte
              model system (Ceratodon purpureus) in which both generations are sufficiently
              large and morphologically complex to facilitate genotypic and phenotypic
              analysis.  Multiple populations from throughout the distribution of the species
              will be grown in a common environment to assess the degree of correlation
              between the two generations.  Genome mapping techniques will then be used to
              test whether the same genes are associated with changes in the two
              generations.

This study will answer fundamental questions concerning the
              genetic basis of adaptation, in addition to providing a deeper understanding of
              life cycles that are common to all plants.  It will be the most comprehensive
              examination of the whole plant life cycle using modern genetic tools.  The
              Ceratodon experimental system is being utilized by many scientists working on
              applied as well as basic problems in biology, and the genetic insights
              generated by this study will further increase its utility for other research.
