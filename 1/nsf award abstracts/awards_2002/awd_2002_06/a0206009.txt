Abstract    :
              	Flower color is an important ecological trait because it is used by plants to
              attract pollinators.  Differences in flower color between species of Ipomoea
              (morning glories) will often lead to the presence of different sets of
              pollinators and a lack of pollen exchange.  In order to understand the genetic
              basis for differences in flower color, one can study the major biosynthetic
              genes that produce flower pigments.  Differences in these genes should be
              manifest as differences in DNA sequence, expression level, or expression time. 
              A combination of crossing studies, DNA sequencing, and gene expression assays
              will be used to identify the gene or genes responsible for flower differences
              between two closely related species of Ipomoea: the white-flowered I. lacunosa
              and the purple-flowered I. triloba.  
	The number and type of mutations fixed
              during adaptive evolution is a long-standing question in biology.  Recent work
              has suggested that, contrary to longstanding views, only a few mutations of
              large effect may be involved in adaptation.  Furthermore, with increasing
              evidence of the conservation of most proteins over long time periods, it has
              been suggested that important mutations may occur primarily in regulatory
              sequences.  In order to address these issues, the genetic basis of flower color
              differences between I. lacunosa and I. triloba will be examined.
