Abstract    :
              This study assesses the relative importance of ecological and genetic mechanisms
              that restrict natural hybridization in plants.  Two closely related species of
              Ipomopsis plants grow in close proximity in several sites in the mountains of
              the western U.S.  By comparing contact sites where hybrids are common with a
              contact site where the same two species do not hybridize successfully and
              instead form a bimodal distribution of morphologies, it is possible to
              investigate the importance of different isolating mechanisms to the rate of
              hybridization.  Sites with low versus high frequencies of hybrids will be
              compared with respect to the degree of introgression of genes using molecular
              methods. Behavior of bird and insect pollinators will be examined at each site
              to test for differences in gene flow induced by behavioral choices or ability
              of pollinators to transfer pollen.  Experimental pollinations will test for
              differences in the competitive ability of pollen from another
              species.

Hybridization rates vary tremendously across different taxonomic
              groups.  Understanding the reasons why will contribute to an understanding of
              the fundamental problem of how species differences and biological diversity are
              maintained.  It could also help in predicting impacts of hybridization with
              genetically engineered crops or with invasive plant species.
