Abstract    :
              
Habitat fragmentation and small population size may lead to a decrease in
              genetic variation and, consequently, the long-term viability of populations. 
              New molecular genetic techniques have been developed to identify changes in
              genetic variation over time from contemporary samples.  However, these
              techniques have rarely been tested in species in which both historic and
              contemporary patterns of genetic variation are known. This research will
              examine the power of these techniques to reconstruct historic patterns of
              genetic variation in greater prairie chickens, a species of grouse that
              formerly occurred throughout the prairies of midwestern North America and is
              now found in fragmented populations, some of which are threatened with
              extinction. Historic patterns of genetic variation will be obtained from
              mitochondrial DNA sequences of museum specimens collected prior to habitat
              fragmentation and population decline (1872-1950).  These will be compared to
              already analyzed sequences from contemporary populations. 

This analysis of
              both contemporary and historic populations will provide empirical support for
              several critical assumptions of new molecular techniques and an extraordinarily
              detailed picture of population processes during the decline of a threatened
              species.   From a conservation perspective, this information will also be
              essential for delineating management units and identifying populations that may
              be suitable for translocation programs.
