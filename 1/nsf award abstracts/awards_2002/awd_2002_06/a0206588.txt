Abstract    :
              Nitrogen deposition has increased in several regions in the United States due to
              inadvertent emissions from agro-industrial activities.  This project is
              designed to investigate three important fates for nitrogen inputs in temperate
              forests: microbial immobilization, incorporation into slowly decomposing soil
              organic matter, and denitrification gas emissions.  The ability of these sinks
              to retain nitrogen inputs may determine the sustainability of forest ecosystems
              and may affect global warming and aquatic ecosystem health.  For example, as
              nitrogen inputs increase, increased denitrification may result in increased
              emissions of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas.  This project will
              investigate the ability of soils to retain nitrogen through biotic (microbial)
              and abiotic (physiochemical) mechanisms, and the response of denitrification to
              changes in environmental conditions and changes in microbial biodiversity.  The
              results of this study will be critical to predicting the response of forest
              ecosystems to increasing nitrogen deposition.
