Abstract    :
              A key goal of ecology is to understand how ecosystems process materials and
              energy.
In this proposal, we focus on the energetic importance of
              terrestrially-derived dissolved
organic matter (DOM) for lake ecosystems.
              Using laboratory-based studies, we will
assess how terrestrial DOM quantity
              and quality influence the production and growth
efficiency of pelagic
              bacteria. These two processes ultimately dictate how much
terrestrial DOM
              enters lake food webs. We will then incorporate the laboratory data into
a
              simulation model that will predict conditions under which terrestrial DOM is
              likely to
be energetically important for higher trophic levels. We are
              particularly interested in
using the model to assess terrestrial carbon flow
              in lakes with contrasting food webs and
trophic states. Finally, we will test
              model predictions by examining the stable isotopic
signatures (delta 13 C) in
              zooplankton from a wide array of New England lakes. Results from
this study
              will clarify the energetic importance of spatially linked ecosystems
              and
broaden our understanding of how allochthonous inputs influence food web
              dynamics. In
addition, our studies will aid in decision-making regarding land
              use activities that modify
carbon export to lakes such as agriculture,
              shoreline development, forestry, and wetland
delineation.
