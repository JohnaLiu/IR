Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to reduce
              the cost of fuel
cell electrodes by preparing a novel class of oxygen
              reduction electrocatalysts featuring
high activity, low cost, and greater
              longevity. The basis of this catalyst is a novel
multimetallic catalyst. The
              result of this effort will be an electrocatalyst suitable for use
in the fuel
              cells envisoned for next generation vehicles (NGVs), as well as fixed fuel
              cells
for commercial power generation.

This research will advance the
              understanding of electrocatalysis, extending the world of
known catalytic
              materials, and providing further opportunities for research. This will
also
              provide opportunities for teaching, training, and learning. Additionally,
              the
technological fruits of the project will benefit society by reducing
              pollution from fossil fuel
sources. Finally, society will benefit economically
              from the elimination of costly
platinum from fuel cells.
