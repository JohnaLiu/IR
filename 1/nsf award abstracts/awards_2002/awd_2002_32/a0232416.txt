Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the
              feasibility
of developing a technology to optimize accumulation and subsequent
              removal of a valuable element from integrated gasification combined-cycle
              (IGCC) systems. IGCC is a highly efficient, low-emissions technology that uses
              coal and other feed stocks to produce electricity, process heat, and high-value
              fuels and chemicals. Deposits containing a valuable metalloid accumulate in an
              IGCC system, requiring significant downtime for
cleaning and loss of revenue.
              The proposed technology will lead to recovery of a
metalloid as part of
              routine operation of IGCC systems. Metalloid capture will be performed using
              bench-scale laboratory equipment with a simulated gasification environment.
              Bonding mechanisms will be characterized to determine if spalling of deposits
              through thermal cycling and soot blowing is a feasible method of recovering
              deposits on-line.

This innovation would substantially increase revenue by
              providing a marketable product stream and would decrease operating and
              maintenance costs by improving the efficiency of the system.
