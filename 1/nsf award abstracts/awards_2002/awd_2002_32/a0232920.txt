Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project describes a
              powerful new approach to GIS data-mining for large image databases.  The
              current inefficiencies in extracting information from these databases are
              primarily caused by the limited ability to extract baseline geographic
              information (such as road networks) from images. The proposed system addresses
              this need by combining feature extraction efficiencies with the ability to
              refine queries efficiently.  The feature extraction system reduces the labor
              required for extracting information from imagery and the query refinement
              system incorporates user-driven and data-driven strategies to focus on
              interesting and relevant discoveries. The proposed system will also provide
              solutions for multi-media applications containing imagery, web-based
              applications, medical image repositories, and other applications. 
              

Geo-spatial information technology is rapidly becoming a cornerstone of
              scientific research, environmental modeling, local government planning, and
              federal government security programs. The proposed system also has commercial
              potential for other application domains such as medical imaging.
