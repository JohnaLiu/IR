Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is focused on
              automating the identification of individual fish while eliminating mutilation. 
              The project, named TNT ("the natural tag"), is directed at developing a new
              fisheries management tool using the latest image processing/pattern recognition
              technology, and it is based on the knowledge that natural marks on animals,
              specifically fish, are unique and can be used to identify individuals over
              space and time.  Proof-of-concept will demonstrate: 1) elimination of fish
              mutilation 2) larger number of fish 'tagged' per dollar spent, 3) more fish
              tagged per unit time, 4) a more comprehensive set of statistical data archived
              for each fish, 5) reduction or elimination of 'tag loss', and 6) elimination of
              tag reading errors.  The first expected outcome substantially addresses the
              perennial issue of ethical standards and behavior with respect to
              mark-recapture science.  The last five deal with advancing the state-of-the-art
              of fisheries science and represent immediate improvement of the cost/benefit
              ratio associated with fish tagging research and commercial aquaculture in
              local, state, federal and international programs.  The TNT system will provide
              fisheries managers and scientists a higher level of biologically sound and
              statistically justifiable data.

Nationally, expected customers of this
              technology include Department of Commerce's NOAA, National Marine Fisheries
              Service and Department of Interior's U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and Bureau of
              Land Management, the Departments of Fish & Game for each of the 50 states as
              well as many universities.  Organizations in approximately 35 foreign countries
              are target customers also.
