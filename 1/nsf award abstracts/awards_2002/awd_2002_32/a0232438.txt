Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop a
              catalytic process for the generation of hydrogen and/or hydrocarbon fuel gases
              from biomass. The project will generate fuel gases by reactions of oxygenated
              hydrocarbons derived from carbohydrates (biomass) with liquid water at low
              temperatures (~200 C). Current hydrogen production is based on fossil
              hydrocarbons. The problem with fossil hydrocarbon use is that it is
              non-renewable, increasingly imported and generates greenhouse gasses. This
              project represents a new route for renewable fuel gas generation. The overall
              project objective is to identify cost effective catalysts, catalytic structures
              and operating parameters to maximize the efficient production of hydrogen
              and/or hydrocarbons derived from US grown biomass for use in fuel cell and
              combustion engine applications. 

The commercial and broader impacts of this
              project will be improved energy security as well as clean and renewable fuel
              gases that may be used as fuel sources for fuel cells, internal combustion
              engines, and gas turbines.
