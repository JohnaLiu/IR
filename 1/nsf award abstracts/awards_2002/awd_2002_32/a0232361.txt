Abstract    :
              The goal of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to
              improve the way in which Geographic Information System (GIS) databases are
              created, updated and utilized.  Software systems will be built that enable
              users to rapidly and inexpensively generate, update, analyze and visualize
              high-resolution 3D digital terrain models from digital images collected by a
              wide range of aerial and satellite platforms. Using an integrated approach that
              takes into account all aspects of the terrain modeling process, software tools
              will be developed that transform raw data collected from new high-resolution
              digital imaging sensors and low-cost navigation instruments into
              high-resolution, geographically registered 3D terrain models. 

The low cost
              and short turnaround time for these products will enable government and
              commercial organizations to expand the scope of their GIS applications,
              especially in the areas of environmental monitoring, change detection, and
              urban planning.
