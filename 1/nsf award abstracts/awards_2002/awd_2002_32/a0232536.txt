Abstract    :
                  This research will develop a commercial version of the SHOWME (Systematic
              Historical Overview of Water Management and Environmental) database for a wide
              variety of waste sites, groundwater basins, and water resource projects.  Each
              SHOWME plot will include a concise informative display of 40-60 chemicals with
              regulatory limits, well location map, sampling depth, geology, water levels,
              and well construction details.  SHOWME voluminous displays of water quality,
              geologic, and hydrologic data are designed for expedited site characterization
              and environmental restoration.
    Site workers, regulators, stakeholders, and
              the concerned public spend hours to understand environmental data.  The
              processed informative displays in SHOWME will help avoid the collection of
              trivial data and delay in environmental restoration.
