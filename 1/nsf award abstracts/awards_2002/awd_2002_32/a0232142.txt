Abstract    :
              A special session (including a luncheon) has been organized by the Glass &
              Optical Materials Division Fall Meeting, Pittsburgh, PA
              (http://www.acers.org/meetings/GlassFallMeet/glass.asp) to be held October
              13-16, 2002. The goal is to bring as many pioneering glass scientists as
              possible from National Labs and Universities in the USA and other parts of the
              world to this meeting. There are several aspects to the session: 
a) Science:
              New ideas in the area of glass research and an overview of modeling: this will
              give guidance to the researchers as to the value of modeling in experimental
              research
b) Mentoring: Women role models in the form of invited speakers. 
c)
              Dissemination: The information contained in conference presentation will be
              disseminated to researchers in this field in the form of a refereed special
              edition of J. of Phys., Condensed Matter.
d) Luncheon: The presentations will
              focus on international opportunities and career issues. 

The session will
              stimulate interest, discussion and ideas by bringing together a variety of
              different disciplines and outlooks. Topics covered in the scientific session
              will be of interest to the DMR community in the areas of materials theory,
              condensed matter physics and ceramics. The luncheon talks will have a broader
              appeal; interested persons should contact Jackie Johnson at Argonne Nat. Lab.
