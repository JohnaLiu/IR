Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is intended to establish
              the
technology for the production of an innovative polymer-based
              microcellular
nanocomposites (MCNC). The synergistic marriage of microcellular
              foaming with
nanocomposite technology would create an end product with
              enormous market potential.
This new composite would fill a critical need for
              the next generation of materials for the
aerospace, automotive, medical and
              electronic industries. Nanocomposites offer
enhanced mechanical and physical
              properties while the microcellular foaming process
offers distinct processing
              advantages and weight savings. The project research entails three inter-related
              stages: application of mixing theory, computational simulation, and
              experimental investigation. This systematic study of the processing technology
              will permit for the efficient production and facilitate market penetration of
              MCNC materials.

The project has the potential for numerous commercial
              applications. Current trends across various industries create the demand for
              materials that offer enhanced physical and mechanical properties, reduced
              weights, and improved processing times. These requirements lead to a
              significant impetus to develop a new class of materials derived from the
              marriage of nano-fillers and microcellular foaming technology. Some estimates
              put the worldwide market for nanocomposites by 2009 to be in excess of 1
              billion lbs. MCNC materials have the potential to capture part of this market,
              while opening new ones due to the attractive properties that these materials
              possess.
