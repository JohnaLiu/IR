Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I will develop a novel,
              secure and scalable Quality of Service (QoS)-aware routing algorithm for ad hoc
              wireless networks. The algorithm utilizes several wireless routing optimization
              techniques and lightweight security mechanisms. This research will also extend
              the routing algorithm to support multicast in ad hoc wireless networks.

The
              proposed routing algorithm will permit reduction in the cost of building
              communication infrastructures by facilitating and increasing the adpatation of
              ad hoc wireless networks for building reliable communication networks in
              locations where it is difficult to establish fixed infrastructure or
              centralized administration.  Examples of such locations are conferences,
              lectures, crowd control theaters, search and rescue theaters, disaster and
              recovery theaters, and battlefields.
