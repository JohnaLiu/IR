Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on the
              formation of improved performance, lead-free, piezoelectric ceramics for
              various high performance sensor and transducer applications. The piezoelectric
              response of Barium Zirconium Titanate (BZT) ceramic compositions will be
              enhanced by altering the degree of grain orientation within the ceramic.
              Seeding with a small percentage of properly oriented anisometric, isostructural
              particles (template particles) within the bulk BZT ceramic will produce the
              texture during thermal densification. The piezoelectric response of the
              textured BZT ceramics would be comparable to current lead-based materials, 
              which would allow for greater utility in the commercial sector due to
              environmental constraints.
     Commercially textured, piezoelectric BZT
              ceramics can be used for various electromechanical transducer and sensor
              applications, which include the aerospace, marine, biomedical, and ultrasonic
              industries. The BZT ceramics have the potential of replacing all applications
              currently using lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramics, which are
              environmentally unacceptable because of the lead content.
