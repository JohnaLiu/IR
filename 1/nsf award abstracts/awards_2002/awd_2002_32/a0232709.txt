Abstract    :
              The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will  synthesize
              novel 
slurries for chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) of low dielectric
              constant (K) 
materials. Standard abrasives such as silica and alumina lead to
              significant scratching, 
indenting and delamination of the soft low K surface.
              In this project it is proposed to use 
nanoporous silica based slurries in
              which the hardness of the particle can be controlled. 
In the project,
              synthesis of nanoporous silica particles will first be carried out followed by
              charcterization; next will be development of  the slurry formulation followed
              by charcterization and finally testing against the specific needs of the CMP
              application.

Commercially, these slurries are expected to reduce surface
              defects and enhance slurry stability. It is expected that major electronic
              manufacturing companies will use this new type of slurry. Wafer level
              experiments are already planned on patterned wafers in 
collaboration with key
              industrial partners.
