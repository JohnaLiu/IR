Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will synthesize
              and
consolidate a smart composite material, copper-zirconium tungstate, with
              high thermal conductivity (>240 W/m.K) and low thermal expansion (< 5 x 10-6/K)
              for thermal management applications. As packaging densities and power
              requirements increase, more and more power is being generated per specific
              area, thereby generating more heat. The current chip performance limitation is
              related to packaging materials when considering the component size reduction.
              The recent findings of negative thermal expansion in zirconium tungstate
              (ZrW2O8) have attracted many interesting applications for this material
              particularly in composites where thermal expansion is a major concern. Copper
              (Cu) has good thermal conductivity but it is not currently in use as a thermal
              management material, because of its high thermal expansion mismatch with either
              silicon (Si) or gallium arsenide (GaAs). A composite such as Cu- ZrW2O8,
              consisting of a high-conductivity metallic matrix and ceramic phase with
              strongly negative coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) is ideally suitable
              for electronic thermal management applications. In the project synthesis of
              Cu-ZrW2O8 composite will be achieved using the microwave plasma and low
              temperature chemical coating methods. Consolidation of Cu-ZrW2O8 composite will
              be carried out using a rapid consolidation technique, plasma pressure
              consolidation (P2C).

Commercially, the major applications of this material
              are in substrates for microelectronics, and  heat sinks in electronic devices.
              It will also improve the performance of ceramics in electrical insulators  and
              power transistor modules.The other potential uses of zirconium tungstate are in
              thermal expansion compensation in dental fillings.
