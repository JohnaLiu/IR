Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
              the feasibility of collecting and converting to DC power infrared radiation
              (IR) from heated sources using monolithically integrated, nanowire
              antenna/rectifying diode arrays (IR-AAID).  Using scaleable, self-organizing,
              and inexpensive electrochemical processing on low cost substrates, the
              antenna/diode systems can be engineered to convert IR radiation from a
              particular heat source/emitter with specific characteristics by simply changing
              the antenna geometry. Unlike traditional semiconductor-based IR photovoltaic
              materials with their associated low efficiencies, high material costs,
              temperature sensitivity and matched high temperature emitter requirements, an
              IR-AAID system could potentially convert heat to electricity at over 40%
              efficiency. The best IR photovoltaic modules typically operate at less than 5%
              efficiency, require 1200 to 2000 Celsius emitter temperatures to match
              available band gaps, and require very expensive materials with chemically
              tailored compositions to match specific energy applications. 

The commercial
              and broader impacts of this technology will be low-cost nanowire arrays with
              high density and tunable diameter/length aspect ratios over a relatively large
              area for heat collection applications. These applications will vary from
              portable power packs that use low temperature heat, to the generation of
              electricity from high temperature nuclear and conventional heat sources where
              noise or other environmental concerns are an issue.
