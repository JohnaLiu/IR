Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on massive
              datasets containing millions or even billions of data points. Statistical
              analyses of data on this scale present new computational challenges.     
              Squashing algorithms compress massive datasets into much smaller ones so that
              outputs from statistical analyses carried out on the smaller (squashed)
              datasets reproduce outputs from the same statistical analyses carried out on
              the original datasets. Squashing represents an alternative to sampling as a way
              of dealing with massive data and aims to significantly outperform sampling in
              terms of predictive and inferential accuracy. Squashing affords several
              advantages:  (1) Computationally intensive statistical procedures such as
              non-linear modeling or large-scale variable selection, infeasible when directly
              applied to the massive dataset, become feasible when applied to the squashed
              representation; (2) Since the squashed dataset may be several orders of
              magnitude smaller than the original massive dataset, electronic data
              dissemination becomes much simpler; (3) Because squashed datasets are synthetic
              (they contain no actual data points), they pose no disclosure risk.  The
              objective of this research is to critically evaluate squashing, and, contingent
              on a satisfactory evaluation, develop a commercial data squashing software
              product.
    Such massive data sets can be encountered, for instance, in
              computational biology, medical surveillance systems, telecommunications, and
              astronomy.
