Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
              the feasibility of developing an innovative manufacturing process to produce
              cost-effective, high-performance long-fiber thermoplastic composites for
              Next-Generation Vehicles applications.  There is general concern in the U.S.
              over the growing usage of imported oil, and about 68 percent of the total U.S.
              consumption of petroleum are related to transportation.  Materials technologies
              to enable production of safe and cost-effective lightweight vehicles have been
              identified as critical to reducing fuel consumption in future vehicles.  This
              project will validate the concept of using compounding technique to produce
              well-mixed long-fiber thermoplastic composites with a fiber length exceeding
              its critical length.  Additionally, the innovation would be versatile and
              inexpensive enough for widespread use.

The commercial and broader impacts of
              this technology will be to supply the automotive and other industries with
              improved performance long-fiber thermoplastic composites at a significantly
              lower cost (by 30-50 percent) to meet their needs for lighter, stronger,
              recyclable and cost-effective materials for future generation vehicles
              applications.
