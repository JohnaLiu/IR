Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will test the viability
              of a desktop computer-based basin simulator that is networked to distribute
              database management, simulation, and visualization. The basin simulator has
              been in development since the mid-1980's and presently exists as a research
              tool.  The focus of this project is to bring recent developments in operating
              systems, programming languages, desktop computers, and client/server database
              management systems into the program to make it accessible to  industry and
              academia.  The software will be a computationally intensive, networked program.
               Off-the-shelf technology and hardware will allow the cost of the program
              development and maintenance to be competitive in the market.

Success of this
              project will further advance geological sciences to include more fundamental
              physical and chemical concepts, and to promote multi-disciplinary industry and
              academic collaborations for developing even more advanced basin simulators.
