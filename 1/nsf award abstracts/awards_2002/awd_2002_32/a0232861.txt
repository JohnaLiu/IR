Abstract    :
                    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will evaluate the
              merit and feasibility of the World Wide Student Laboratory (WWSL).  WWSL is a
              scalable Internet-based education infrastructure that enables students, under
              the guidance of their educators, to have 24x7 remote access enabling them to
              carry out, advanced educational experiments in modern laboratories at leading
              universities and research centers worldwide, regardless of the students'
              location.  This approach will improve the quality of the laboratory experience
              and substantially reduce the cost of the educational laboratory, which is the
              most difficult and expensive segment of science and engineering education to
              provide.  Using WWSL, educational institutions will be able to afford better
              facilities for the education they provide, access to the best lab facilities in
              other institutions, and substantially broaden the number of lab study subjects
              in their curriculum.  Individual instructors can customized the content and
              methods of lab for their students. WWSL will make available all materials
              necessary for fulfillment of the lab work
     The economic and societal
              benefits of the WWSL approach are based on the potential a dramatic increase in
              the efficiency of existing lab facilities in universities.  WWSL can serve
              traditional universities, colleges and high schools, as well as distance
              education institutions.
