Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project addresses the
              need for low-cost manufacturing of fuel cell components, by the development of
              a reel-to-reel electrodeposition process to maximize catalyst dispersion and
              utilization at loadings of 0.1 mg/cm2. In Phase I, 1) The feasibility of
              plating 0.1 mg Pt/cm2 loadings of highly dispersed catalyst (120 m2/g Pt) onto
              carbon electrodes  will be demonstrated, 2) the catalyzed electrodes will be
              analyzed for loading, dispersion and performance in fuel cell stacks, and 3) a
              reel to- reel electrodeposition system will be designed. 

The ultimate
              customer for the proposed technology is the automotive consumer. It is expected
              that 2.4 million fuel cell powered vehicles, a 4.3% market share in global auto
              production, will be on the road by 2011. Further commercial applications
              include stationary and non-automotive mobile power sources.
