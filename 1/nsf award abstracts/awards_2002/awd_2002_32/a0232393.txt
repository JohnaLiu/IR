Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will define technologies
              to successfully recover painted plastic automobile parts from end-of-life
              vehicles. 400 million pounds of plastic is consumed annually to produce
              automotive exterior parts. These parts are typically large and readily
              identifiable and could be recovered from automobile salvage yards yet they
              continue to be disposed of in landfills. This project will evaluate the quality
              of plastic from parts recovered from automobile salvage operations from various
              regions of the country and develop a process to remove paint and economically
              recycle the plastic back into many of the original automotive applications.
              

The automotive industry uses approximately 425 million pounds of 
              thermoplastic polyolefins annually on vehicles produced in North America.
              Success of this work will allow the U.S. automobile industry to enhance its
              competitiveness when faced with mandates for minimum recycle-content
              materials.
