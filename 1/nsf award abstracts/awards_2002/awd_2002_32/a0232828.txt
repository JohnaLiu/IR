Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase project will implement and
              test the feasibility of a new algorithm for statistical text categorization. 
              This algorithm combines the ease and effectiveness of learning from examples,
              while incorporating task-specific constraints that currently require ad hoc
              rules.  The project will evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of these
              algorithms.  Alternative optimization algorithms and alternative approximations
              to intractable quantities will be benchmarked.  Categorization accuracy will be
              evaluated on public text categorization data sets and on data from operational
              text categorization users.
     Ornarose, Inc. will develop and license
              software libraries including this algorithm to software vendors in a variety of
              industries.  Vendors for whom text categorization is not a core competency
              increasingly wish to support categorization in software that works with text
              data.  Market niches where text categorization under task-specific constraints
              is compelling include knowledge management, news alerting, email/web filtering,
              and data mining.  Discounted licenses will be provided for academic
              institutions and scholarly publication of nonproprietary results on publicly
              available text categorization data sets is planned.
