Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              inexpensive methods to pretreat commercial powdered activated carbons (PAC)
              used for power plant mercury control so that they will not interfere with
              effective use of fly ash in concretes.   The objective of this project is to
              screen and optimize such pretreatment methods. Major project tasks include
              producing pretreated samples; testing for effects on AEAs, resulting cements,
              and mercury removal performance; and developing a fundamental understanding of
              the chemical processes involved.  Carbon materials researchers at Brown
              University and their Energy and Environmental Technologies Laboratory will
              assist in the effort.
 
Commercially the substitution of fly ash wastes for
              cement in construction applications is one of America.s biggest recycling
              successes.  Unfortunately, it was recently discovered that if even minimal PAC
              is injected into power plant flue gases for mercury emission control, the fly
              ash will be rendered unusable for concrete.  The highly-adsorbent carbons
              severely interfere with the air-entraining admixtures (AEAs) added to concrete
              for air entrainment and stabilization.  The economic implications for utilities
              may be huge. Thus the PAC pretreatments developed here which minimize adverse
              effects on AEA while enhancing, or at least not degrading, PAC mercury removal
              performance are of prime importance.
