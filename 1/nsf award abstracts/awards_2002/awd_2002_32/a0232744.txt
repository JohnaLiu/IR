Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the need to
              of power component performance as a function of system design to reduce the
              overall risk associated with integration. The project focus is the development
              of a Power Component Evaluation System (PCES) which improves on traditional
              methods of system evaluation. PCES couples actual power hardware to a virtual
              simulation of a system through a Simulation-Stimulation (Sim-Stim) interface
              which sources and sinks power to the Hardware Under Test (HUT) as well as
              measuring variables. Since PCES should replicate the HUT's performance just as
              if connected to a physical system, the Sim-Stim interface will be transparent
              to the overall operation. The objective is to develop a methodology to design
              Sim-Stim Interface parameters for a wide range of power system types, operating
              modes and phenomena so the HUT operates as if it were in a physical system
              within a prescribed level of accuracy. The anticipated result of the research
              is a metric to perform trade offs between implementation complexity and
              accuracy. PCES will enable the development of new all electric and/or
              hybrid-electric systems as well as quantifying the effect of new/prototype
              hardware components on such issues as power quality, vulnerability and power
              transients.

The potential commercial benefits of the PCES system will be a
              faster, cheaper and more effective method for the design, development and
              commercialization of new electric power products and services.
