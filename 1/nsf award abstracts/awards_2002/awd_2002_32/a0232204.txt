Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              trimetallic-nitride-template metallofullerenes (trimetaspheres) for use  as
              improved MRI contrast agents. The largest barrier to providing these
              trimetasphere materials in significant quantities is  the lack of an
              economical, efficient means of separating these materials from undesirable
              empty-cage C60 and C70 fullerenes.  To address this issue, the proposed effort
              offers innovative, ingenious solutions to the problem of large-scale synthesis
              and separation processes for these nanomaterials. The project tasks are 1) to 
              increase generator throughput of trimetasphere-containing soot, 2) to advance
              vapor-phase deposition techniques as a prepurification step, and 3) to
              establish the feasibility of a chemical-separation process, which will enable
              large-scale nanomaterials production.  The expectation is to totally remove
              HPLC from all stages of purification. 
 

Commercially, trimetaspheres are
              expected to find valuable applications in 1) improved medical care through
              novel imaging and diagnostic properties, 2) new pharmaceuticals, via high
              throughput screening, 3) faster and more productive internet use, through
              faster optical switches and components that provide higher bandwidth, 4) faster
              computers, through quantum computing devices built from nanomaterials, and 5)
              military devices including sensors, imaging devices, non-linear optical
              devices, new superconductors and 
variable capacitors.
