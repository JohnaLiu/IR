Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project possesses a unique
              chemical detection technology in which colorimetric changes in an array of dyes
              constitute a signal much like that generated by the mammalian olfaction system;
              each dye is a cross-responsive sensor. This technology has recently been
              expanded into the realm of the detection of aqueous analytes for use as an
              electronic tongue - dubbed TasteSeeing. Preliminary results indicate that
              near-instantaneous, vivid responses are obtained from small solution samples
              and that the majority of the array appears to be robust in water. This Phase I
              program is designed to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and
              reproducibility of the technology as a methodology to characterize aqueous
              solutions. 

This technique, while attractive to a wide range of markets,
              will initially be 
focused on the detection and identification of potential
              terrorist chemical agents.
The goal is to integrate the TasteSeeing technology
              into a portable and inexpensive device to detect rapidly low levels of
              dissolved chemicals in water and other fluids.
