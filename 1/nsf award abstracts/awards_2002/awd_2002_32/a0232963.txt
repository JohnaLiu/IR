ABSTRACT

The investigator is organizing the 2002 Red Raider mini-symposium
              at Texas
Tech University on ``Contemporary Algebra and Algebraic Geometry".
              The 
mini-symposium will consist of five distinguished lectures on current
              
research topics on group theory and its applications, algebraic structures
              
and algebraic geometry.  The distinguished lectures will be delivered by
              
William Fulton, Robert Griess, James Lepowsky, Gregory Margulis and Efim
              
Zelmanov.

The purpose of the mini-symposium series is to put together a
              program in
which some of the most oustanding scholars in selected areas
              of
Mathematics and Statistics will deliver lectures on timely research
              topics
and methodology, with the objective of providing members of the
              
mathematical community, especially early career mathematicians and
graduate
              students, an opportunity to broaden their repertoire of research
tools and to
              learn about new research venues. The event also provides a
forum for members
              of the mathematical community to interact with
outstanding scholars in a
              relaxed atmosphere. The above list of speakers
includes two Field Medalists
              (the Field Medal is the highest recognition 
bestowed in Mathematics) and
              three members of the National Academy of 
Sciences.
