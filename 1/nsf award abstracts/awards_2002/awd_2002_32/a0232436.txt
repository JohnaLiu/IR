Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and
              implement a completely novel chatter control scheme. In many machine tools,
              fluid bearings (also known as hydrostatic and hydrodynamic bearings) are
              gaining popularity. The project will apply low-power piezo actuators to
              modulate the input flow rate of the fluid into the spindle housing. By
              carefully computing the actuator voltages, we can generate the correct amount
              of input flow rate so that the chatter effects will be minimized. There are
              several advantages associated with this new approach. First, since the fluid
              pressure is directly acting on the spindle unit, the response will be fast,
              direct, and effective. Second, since piezo is used to control the flow rate,
              not the whole-spindle housing, only very low power amplifiers are needed to
              regulate the flow. Third, the overall chatter control cost will be
              significantly reduced as commercial off-the-shelf, rather than custom designed,
              piezo actuators can be used. Fourth, no significant modification of the machine
              is needed because four small piezo actuators will be inserted near the inlets.
              Only a modest change in mechanical design needs to be done.

The commercial
              application will provide a practical approach to chatter control. Chatter is
              the primary limiting factor in metal removal rate in machine tools. To a first
              order approximation, a machine tool with twice the metal removal rate is worth
              twice as much. This technology will be useful for other types of machine tools
              such as milling, lathe, and boring.
