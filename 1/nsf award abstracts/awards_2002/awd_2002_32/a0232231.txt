Abstract    :
              This Phase I project will provide a low-cost process for producing high-pressure
              hydrogen (e.g., 
7.500 psia,  510 atm)  for use in vehicles. This process uses
              a proven, regenerable, low cost CO2 sorbent and a small-scale process that
              reforms natural gas, diesel, gasoline, or oil derived from biomass to hydrogen
              and compresses that H2 to high pressure for use in vehicles.  Although the
              regeneration of the CO2 sorbent requires energy, the new sorbent/process
              effectively minimizes the efficiency impact.  All of the necessary reforming
              reactions, water gas shift and carbon dioxide removal are performed in one
              reactor.  This results in higher hydrogen purity, better energy integration
              (i.e., higher efficiency), reactions eliminate high temperature heat exchanges
              or valves, and greatly reduces steam requirements and minimizes the use of
              downstream process.  The result is a lower cost, smaller system with improved
              efficiency. 

The key aspect of the system is the low cost reforming of the
              fuel.  In the near term, the production of H2 would benefit merchant
              applications.  The proposed system can generate on-site hydrogen at scales that
              are similar to the current on-site hydrogen generation plants at very high
              purity and low cost.  In the long term the new system can provide hydrogen at
              low cost to distribution centers for use in vehicles and other fuel cell
              applications.
