Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a
              piezoelectric motor-drive with Ultra-High-Vacuum (UHV) compatibility for
              high-speed driving of positioning platforms. The proposed piezoelectric
              motor-drive will provide an as-yet unrealized combination of several desirable
              characteristics: nanometer and sub-nanometer precision; speeds in excess of 500
              mm/s; drive capacities in the range of 10's of kilograms; and, ranges of travel
              in excess of 500 mm. 

The commercial potential of this concept will provide
              a revolutionary means for rapid and accurate materials handling for
              fabrication, inspection, metrology, and packaging of microparts and
              microsystems.
