Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a prototype
              Polymer Workbench - for use by scientists/ engineers in the polymer industry -
              using the concept and tools developed around Web Services. Large investments in
              developing models for use in polymer manufacturing are not effectively utilized
              as the usage is currently limited to few specialists because the user needs to
              navigate through a multitude of models in a multiple and highly disjointed user
              environment, often requiring tedious manual transfer of data and modeling
              results from one environment to another. 

The Polymer Workbench will address
              this need through applying Web Services concept designed to allow the user to
              access a large number of various polymer models through a single software
              platform with common user interface, database, and communication protocol for
              all models. This work will develop the common communication protocol by
              developing an XML-based markup language specific for polymers, PolymerML, to
              achieve standardization of the data and information flow between the user and
              models.  The proposed work will address this important need in a very large
              industry where annual sales in the U.S. for polymer materials alone are $250
              billion and expenditure on modeling and simulation exceeds $ 100 million.
