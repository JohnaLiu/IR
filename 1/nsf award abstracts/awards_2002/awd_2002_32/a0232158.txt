Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project provides a plan
              to develop, deploy, and evaluate a virtual reality-based modeling kit that will
              enable students to build virtual models of gorilla motion and social
              interaction within a web-based inquiry framework.  Using the Virtual Gorilla
              Construction Kit, students will build virtual models within the context of
              answering questions about gorilla behavior.  The modeling possible with the
              virtual environment the investigator is proposing, which is
              quantitative/logical in its underlying operation, can help students move beyond
              the purely descriptive to an understanding of the relationships between
              relevant variables.  Virtual reality is an environment that is uniquely suited
              for the dynamic nature of 3-D gorilla motion.  Research has shown that students
              do not effectively blend lectures, 2-D static images, and textual descriptions
              of scientific phenomena.  Building virtual reality models provides the right
              match for the content and builds deep understanding of the 3-D nature of
              science concepts and the inquiry skills of model-based science.  Thus, the
              investigator will develop the Virtual Gorilla Construction Kit as representing
              an exciting learning environment, which uses the power of cyberspace to learn
              about gorilla space.

The market for the project for this immediate version
              of the software will be other zoo educational programs, middle school life
              science, high school biology, and university freshman-level animal behavior
              survey courses.
