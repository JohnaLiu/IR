Wentworth

This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in
              mathematics involves Richard A. Wentworth at Johns Hopkins University and
              Elisha Falbel at the University of Paris VI. The objective of this project is a
              concentrated collaborative research effort in the area of discrete groups and
              geometrical analysis of low dimensional manifolds.  They will study
              representation of surface groups in U (n) and the deformation theory and
              rigidity issues of spherical CR manifolds.   The U.S. investigator brings to
              this collaboration expertise in the geometrical analytic aspects of
              representations of surface groups.  This is complemented by French expertise in
              CR manifolds, discrete groups and their deformations. 

This award represents
              the U.S. side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for
              Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses
              for the U.S. investigator and graduate student.  The CNRS will support the
              visits of the French researcher and student to the United States.   U.S. and
              French graduate students will benefit from the international approach to
              research and international exposure for their work.
