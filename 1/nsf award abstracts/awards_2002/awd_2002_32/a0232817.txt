Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will include the
              design, implementation and evaluation of a new product intended to improve
              accessibility to science museums and other public exhibit spaces for visitors
              who are blind or visually impaired. The proposed system will rely on a network
              of user-activated audio beacons arrayed throughout an exhibit environment:
              visitors will control the system using cell phones.  A limited but functional,
              version of the system will be installed at the New York Hall of Science in New
              York City, and user trials will be carried out to evaluate the system's
              effectiveness as a navigational tool and as a provider of exhibit-related
              information.
     Based on positive findings in Phase I, the next phase of the
              research will include outfitting the entire museum with a network of
              user-activated audio beacons, in anticipation of marketing the system,
              including device, software and installation/service, to other institutions
              wishing to expand their visitorship, to include members of this growing and
              often overlooked population.  Long-term goals include extending the audience
              for telephone-based museum guides to mainstream audiences, and developing audio
              beacon networks for other types of public environments.
