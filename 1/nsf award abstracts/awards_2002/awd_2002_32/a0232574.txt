Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is directed at
              developing novel high-temperature  membranes/MEA for PEM fuel cell system for
              next generation vehicle (NGV) application. The overall objective is to operate
              PEM fuel cell at 120-150C to achieve high cell performance, improve CO
              tolerance, mitigate  water and thermal management challenges and reduce system
              cost.  The technical approach is to develop  high-performing MEA consisting of
              membranes of high water retention capability and cathode of low  polarization
              at high temperatures.     

High-temperature PEMFC is attractive due to its
              unique characteristics of simple system design.  Such a  clean, high-efficiency
              and simple system is very attractive for NGV. The main commercial market will
              be NGV passenger car and bus.    Other markets will include mobile/portable
              power, ship, and commercial/residential building applications..
