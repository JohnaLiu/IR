Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an
              innovative carbon- polymer-matrix material for gas separation applications.
              Synthesized with a unique method, the material possesses unique
              chemical-physical properties, such as liquid expelling and catalytic
              reactivity. These unique properties, plus a suitable chemical modification,
              will render the material capable of removing sulfur dioxide and mercury vapor
              simultaneously from coal-fired power plant flue gases. During this Phase I
              program, the feasibility to synthesize the proposed material and to use the
              material for SO2/Hg removal will be established. The different synthesis
              methods will be tested to optimize the material's liquid expelling property;
              different chemical modification routes will be tried out to optimize the Hg
              capture capability; and the material's SO2 and Hg removal performance will be
              evaluated. 

The research will provide a path-breaking new technology for
              flue gas pollution abatement, which is simple, low cost, and environment
              friendly.  The technology will greatly benefit coal-fired electrical generation
              industry, which currently generates more than 50% of the electricity in the
              United States.
