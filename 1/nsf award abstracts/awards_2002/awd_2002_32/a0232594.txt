Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate
              the feasibility of creating a system that automatically generates personalized
              broadcasts from a library of audio / video (rich media) content. Such a system
              is needed because individuals are overloaded with rich media content and lack
              advanced tools for navigating this deluge of rich media. Building upon
              StreamSage's existing expertise in dealing with rich media information,
              StreamSage's research will alleviate this problem by creating a system capable
              of creating "personalized rich media broadcasts" that automatically
              characterize the gaps between disjointed segments of content and fill these
              gaps with bridging text that provides necessary background and structure to the
              segments from multiple rich media files.
      The effort in Phase I will
              expand the current-state-of-the-art by developing algorithms capable of
              automatically identifying the types of gaps between the rich media segments and
              by establishing methods by which the information necessary for coherently
              bridging these gaps can be automatically extracted from the rich media files. 
              The personalized broadcast system created by this research would greatly
              improve end-user interactions with the rich media content by intelligently
              ordering and bridging the content pushed or pulled to the end-user.
              Additionally, an automated personalized broadcast system would enable the
              pushing of rich media content on a large scale, which has been impossible to
              date because of the tremendous manual intervention required to create a
              broadcast of usable quality.
