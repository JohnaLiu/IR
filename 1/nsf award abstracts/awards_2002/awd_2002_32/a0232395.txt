Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              new joining technology that will provide substantial technical and cost
              advantages for multiple industrial applications, including metal-to-metal and
              metal-to-ceramic joining. The technology for joining metallic and ceramic
              components is a reactive joining process that uses reactive multilayer foils as
              local heat sources for melting solders or brazes. The foils are a new class of
              nano-engineered materials, in which self-propagating exothermic reactions can
              be ignited at room temperature with a spark. By inserting a multilayer foil
              between two solder (or braze) layers and two components, heat generated by the
              reaction in the foil melts the solder and consequently bonds the components.
              This new method of soldering eliminates the need for a furnace and, with very
              localized heating, avoids thermal damage to the components. 

The commercial
              potential of this reactive bonding process is more rapid than most competing
              technologies, and results in strong and cost-effective joints.
