Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will permit
              production of sodium chlorate without the addition of Na2Cr2O7 to the
              electrolyte during electrolysis and thereby eliminate all the treatment steps
              involved in removing chromate to achieve zero chrome in the crystal chlorate
              and in the plant effluent streams. We propose to investigate various non-chrome
              based, poorly conducting, porous films. Such films will be formed on the
              cathode before assembly of the cell. We propose to demonstrate the superior
              performance of such coatings for the production of chlorate in an
              environmentally acceptable manner. 

Potential customers for this innovation
              include producers of electrolytic sodium chlorate and the sodium chlorate
              technology suppliers. Currently, the world production capacity of NaClO3 is
              2,800,000 metric tons/year, with the North American share being 1,950,000
              metric tons. This industry is projected to grow at an annual rate of 2-3%
              through 2005.
