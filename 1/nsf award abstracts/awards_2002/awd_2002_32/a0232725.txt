Abstract    :
              This  Small  Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop  a
               novel class of coatings, initially for hard turning cutting tool application,
              using a new hybrid coating technology.    Specifically, it  is  proposed  to 
              develop  cubic  boron  nitride-titanium  nitride  (cBN-TiN) nano and micro 
              particulate composite  coatings using a combination  of  electrostatic  spray
              coating (ESC) of cBN powder and chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) of TiN. The
              project will follow a concept where initial  work indicates that a thick
              cBN/TiN composite coating can be deposited in a practical hybrid deposition
              process using the ESC/CVI combination, and that cutting tools coated using this
              method can provide significant improvement in machining performance.
              

Commercially, cBN  tools  are  excellent  candidates  for  machining 
              hardened  ferrous  alloys  and  superalloys tools.  Development of a cBN
              coating process can circumvent limitations  of existing tools and thereby
              provide a significant improvement in cutting tool selection, productivity and
              application range where cBN tools  simply  do  not  exist  (e.g.,  chip-breaker
               inserts,  round-shank  tools  such  as  end-mills,  and drills).
