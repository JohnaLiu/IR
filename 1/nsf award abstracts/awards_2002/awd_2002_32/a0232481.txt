Abstract    :
              This SBIR Phase I program involves the development of a solid-state proton
              conductor (SSPC) suitable for intermediate temperature applications, i.e., >100
              to ~300C. We will develop an ultra-thin (<1 m) dense film (using a properly
              selected inorganic electrolyte), which is supported on our existing commercial
              ceramic membranes as a solid-state proton conductor (SSPC). Based upon the
              specific conductivity, the proposed ultra-thin proton conductor can potentially
              deliver a hydrogen permeance comparable to or better than existing polymeric
              (e.g., Nafion) and high temperature (e.g., perovskite) proton conductors and
              permit operation at the intermediate temperature ranges.  

This SSPC can be
              used as (i) a hydrogen pump for hydrogen recovery from waste/recycle streams,
              (ii) a 2nd stage hydrogen separator to conventional pressure-driven membranes
              for further hydrogen separations without an interstage compressor, and (iii) a
              membrane reactor (MR) to enhance the conversion/yield of industrial
              dehydrogenation reactions.
