Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project targets conversion of a
              technique perfected for washing hydrocarbons in the oil industry, fiber film
              reactor (FFR) technology, into a production organic synthesis technique. A FFR
              will be constructed in Phase I and two reactions studied- an epoxy polyol
              reaction and an epoxy synthesis. Feasibility will be proven by demonstrating
              producible conversion yields. FFR is an elegant, economical, and
              environmentally friendly approach to production-scale organic synthesis. Both
              PTC-based and conventional processing methods will benefit from FFR technology.
              

The commercial market value of FFR processing is enormous - over 3 billion
              pounds annually of organic production could potentially benefit from FFR. The
              environmental advantages are compelling - a waste factor due to emulsion in
              DGEBA production of just 0.05% would add 250,000 pounds to our national waste
              streams- and the added costs to the manufacturer in materials and time are
              equally huge. These two factors will drive FFR demand.
