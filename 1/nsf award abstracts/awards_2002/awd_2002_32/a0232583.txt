Abstract    :
              This research develops the theory underlying the aggregate production function
              to show how labor market policies affect output and total factor  productivity
              in particular. Labor market policies affect output as a result of distorting
              how individual production units react to the economic environment. In this
              context two economies with access to the same level of technology can have two
              different levels of total factor productivity. This research develops a formal
              explicit theory of the nexus between labor market policies and macroeconomic
              performance, and attempts to empirically verify the effects of such policies on
              measured cross-country productivity differences.
