Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I researches a commercial
              software application for personal computing devices. This commercial software
              application for personal computing devices is called the AIR (Atmospheric
              Information Remote). Its purpose is to provide consumers with an accurate,
              convenient and inexpensive way of measuring air pollution in their locality.
              AIR devices are used by people with atmospheric sensitivities. People with
              atmospheric sensitivities are children under 14 years old, people with asthma,
              heart disease or chronic respiratory disease, and the elderly. The AIR device
              protects the health of people with atmospheric sensitivities by letting them
              know when to go indoors or otherwise shelter themselves from the effects of
              nearby polluted air.
     The research objective of this SBIR Phase I project
              is to define the information infrastructure needed to support the commercial
              delivery of the AIR application. Defining the information infrastructure
              involves detailing the specifications of each component within the information
              infrastructure. Some of these components exist, such as personal computing
              devices. Some do not exist, such as project specific software. The results of
              the component specification detail is a design document. This design document
              determines the feasibility of further research and development based on
              marketability and profitability.
