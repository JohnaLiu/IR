Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project focuses on the
              computational design of a new class of shape  memory  alloys  (SMAs ). In this
              project advanced computational design methodology will be used to incorporate
              precipitation strengthening and demonstrate the feasibility of computationally
              designing a nanostructured high performance nickel titanium (NiTi) SMA. The
              computational tools, based on thermodynamic and mechanistic modeling, will  be
              extended  to  predict  the  nanoscale  Heusler  precipitation  microstructure 
              and strengthening within a NiTi matrix. Reversible thermoelastic transformation
              of the matrix will be modeled  with  multicomponent  thermodynamic  modeling 
              and  martensitic  interfacial  mobility theory.  Integrating the extended
              models, the predictive design of novel high strength SMAs will be undertaken by
               assessing various design strategies and trade-offs. 
     Commercially, the
              most common SMAs are monolithic NiTi, having a wide range of use in markets
              representing billions of  dollars.  However, along with copper-based SMAs, they
              have been empirically  optimized  to  their  limits  and  the true  economic 
              potential  has  yet  to  be  realized.   This  approach promises to lead to the
              production of robust SMAs, with fundamentally designed characteristics,
              possessing longer cyclic lifetime and superior performance for both thin film
              and bulk applications.
