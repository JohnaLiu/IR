Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will test the
              feasibility of an innovative method for extending traditional Location-Based
              Services clients into a real-time, 3D spatially correct, interactive system
              that interacts with virtual information embedded into mission-critical
              environments.  The demand for 'point-of-need' information delivery is most
              evident in mission-critical environments typical of first responders, homeland
              security and other themed-specific situations.  However, current LBS's suffer
              from inadequate networks, clients, delivery mechanisms and imprecise
              spatial/contextual relationships between the physical environment and virtual
              media information.  VRGIS Corporation proposes an innovative Enhanced
              Location-Based Services system that integrates Geographic Information Systems,
              Global Positioning Systems, wireless and augmented reality technologies to
              enhance in situ 'Just-In-Time' information and communication layers aware of
              both a user's physical environment and information requirements.  By accessing
              this system through an augmented client (PDA, portable, wearable computing
              devices), users can maneuver through mission-critical environments interacting
              with 3D positioned, real-time, intelligent data points derived from online GIS
              databases, early warning systems, critical building information, sensors,
              hydrological data and communications through a multi-user network.
     The
              proffered technology has the potential to produce an Enhanced Location-Based 3D
              software client that can be utilized in homeland security and emergency
              services applications.
