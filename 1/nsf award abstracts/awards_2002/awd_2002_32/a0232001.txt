Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project seeks to design an
              algorithmic approach and develop pilot software for optimizing the returns and
              associated risks of project portfolios to significantly improve the performance
              of capital finance and budgeting.  This project is expected to achieve:  an
              algorithmic approach for intelligently achieving near-optimal solutions for
              project portfolios in industries such as oil and gas, pharmaceuticals,
              bioengineering, heavy manufacturing, etc.;  pilot software that incorporates
              this approach when integrated with simulation;  key performance indicators to
              test the software;  and a value proposition to assess the satisfaction of
              customer requirements.  

This new approach will provide a way to generate a
              model representation that is far more exploitable than those produced by past
              efforts. Coupled with other software, the outcome will provide a major advance
              in the ability to solve problems of project portfolio management effectively.
              The commercial applications anticipated for the ultimate software system are
              enhancement of the performance of capital budgeting and project portfolio
              management. While recognition of the limitations of current approaches is
              universal, none of the alternatives to these approaches has proved attractive
              enough to become widely embraced as a viable method of choice. Based on this
              observation and an estimate of the market size to be over $750M, a significant
              business opportunity exists.
