Abstract    :
              This Small Business  Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase  I project will develop a
              gas  permeation  process  and  membrane  to  separate  olefin/paraffin 
              mixtures  in  which  a  multilayer  multifunctional membrane  configuration
              ensures  high  selectivity,  high  olefin  productivity,  good mechanical
              stability, excellent impurity tolerability, and long-term  operational
              reliability. Hollow fiber membrane modules will be developed to enhance the 
              olefin  permeance  2~10-fold  compared  to  those  by  conventional  polymer 
              facilitated  transport membranes in addition to much enhanced olefin/paraffin
              selectivity.  This  membrane  system  has  long-term  stability  and 
              reliability to dry  feed containing trace amounts of H2, C2H2, and/or H2S that
              cannot be  treated by traditional membrane processes.     

Compared to the
              other  membrane processes, this process is more promising  and  cost-effective.
               If successfully developed, it could be applied very widely to  olefin/paraffin
              separations.
