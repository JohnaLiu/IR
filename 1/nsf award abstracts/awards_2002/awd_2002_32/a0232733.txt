Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will  develop  processes
               and  controls  for  producing  commercial quantities  of  nanostructured 
              hydroxyapatite (HAP)  biomaterials  suitable  for  load  bearing  orthopedic 
              and  dental applications.    Though  hydroxyapatite's  osteoconductivity  has 
              generated  interest  in  many  clinical 
applications,  conventionally 
              processed  hydroxyapatite  materials  have  been  limited  by  their  poor
              sinterability  and  lack  of  mechanical  strength  attributed  to  poor  phase
               purity  and  homogeneity.    By controlling physical processes such as the
              method of mixing of reactants, particle recovery and synthesis conditions 
              during  the  chemical  precipitation  of  HAP,  the  crystallinity, 
              stoichiometry  and  particle 
morphology of HAP will be optimized for
              mechanical strength.  Hydroxyapatite optimized for mechanical strength will be
              nanocrystalline and possess increased chemical and thermal stability; these
              properties will lead  to  enhanced  sinterability  and minimal  grain  growth. 
                As  a  result,  fully  dense,  nanocrystalline HAP monoliths possessing
              superior chemical homogeneity, microstructural uniformity, ultrafine grain
              sizes and 
minimized flaw sizes will be achieved.  In the final result, the
              nanocrystalline HAP monoliths produced will provide superior  compressive  (900
               MPa)  and  bending  (200  MPa)  strengths  as  well  as  fracture  toughness 
              (1.3 MPam1/2).

Commercially, these nanostructured materials can be formed
              into constructs and utilized in experimental models commonly employed to
              validate orthopedic implants.
Nanostructured hydroxyapatites will contribute
              to better osteoblast attachment, proliferation and mineralization.
