Abstract    :
              The proposal requests funding for partial support of the 7th Tau 2002 Conference
              to be held at the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics, September 10-13,
              2002.

The conference will include the physics of the tau lepton, neutrino
              physics and the role of the tau neutrino in neutrino oscillations and precision
              measurements of QCD where tau data have an impact. It will enhance the
              interaction between the leading theorists and experimentalists in the field.
              The funds will be used to partially cover the costs of travel for participants.
