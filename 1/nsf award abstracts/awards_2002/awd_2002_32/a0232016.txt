Abstract    :
              Building on a currrent GK-12 project (DGE 9979656) the University of Hawaii and
              the the Hawaii Department of Education are working to ensure sustainability of
              the collaboration that has been forged between them.  Graduate students in
              Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Biology (EECB) are interacting with and
              improving the content knowledge and inquiry skills of students and teachers at
              K-12 schools in Hawaii. The graduate and undergraduate Fellows are learning
              current science education reform efforts including national and state standards
              for science education while teaching science through inquiry to improve their
              own communication and teaching skills. Science teachers are provided with
              professional development opportunities to gain current knowledge of research in
              ecology, evolution and conservation biology in Hawaii. The graduate and
              undergraduate Fellows serve as role models of practicing scientists by engaging
              K-12 students and teachers as active participants in ongoing research in the
              EECB program.  Thus a culture of collaboration between science research and
              science education is being developed in Hawaii. The graduate fellows bring
              information from the natural laboratory to the K-12 students and teachers in
              the classroom, and also bring the K-12 students and teachers to the natural
              laboratory in field-based activities. Previous projects have contributed to
              real-life situations within the local communities. In one case, the data
              collected by the K-12 students resulted in the eradication of an incipient
              invasion of an alien ant species as well as the discovery of two previously
              unrecorded species of ants. Thus, besides the intellectual merits of the
              current program in Hawaii, the individual projects are having a broad impact on
              issues being addressed by the local communities. Collaborative relationships
              are being developed with more than 20 community, government (federal, state and
              county), and professional agencies/organizations. Through these collaborations
              K-12 educators and students are developing a better understanding of the
              fragility of the island ecosystems and the importance of efforts made to
              conserve them.
