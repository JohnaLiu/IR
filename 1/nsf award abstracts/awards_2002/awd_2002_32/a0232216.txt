Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will design
              and synthesis of a new family of polymer composites tailored for the
              fabrication of proton exchange membranes (PEMs) to be used in fuel cell
              applications. The novel PEMs, based on a new family of polymeric composites,
              are expected to surpass state-of-the-art Nafion.-type PEMs in general fuel cell
              applications, and to have all the properties needed to allow the development of
              the next generation of H2 and methanol fuel cells. 
     The energy and
              transportation industry is quickly recognizing fuel cells as the leading
              technology in an upcoming revolution in energy production systems.  The market
              accessible to fuel cell applications is simply gigantic, ranging from personal
              electronics and car design to portable and stationary power generators.
              Superior fuel cell systems are needed to penetrate deeply in those markets and
              superior fuel cell systems is exactly what the project will enable if
              successful.
