Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              novel nanoparticle-fluoropolymer (NP-FP) material that fills an immediate
              commercial need and represents a prototype for a family of compositions that
              should spawn new products, businesses, and industries. Desirable optical
              properties of materials often come mixed with undesirable properties. An
              example is the yttrium iron garnet (YIG) which will be employed in an all-fiber
              optical circulator. While it provides strong Faraday rotation and optical
              transparency, these come with a high refractive index and an inconvenient
              crystalline structure that makes incorporation in coatings or molded components
              difficult. Deposition limitations have been overcome by incorporating YIG
              nanoparticles into a polymer matrix, but hydrocarbon polymer matrices also have
              moderately high refractive indices and strong optical absorption beyond 700 nm.
              The project will develop solvent-cast amorphous fluoropolymers films
              impregnated with YIG nanoparticles. The porosity, inertness, and low refractive
              index characteristics of amorphous fluoropolymer materials offer great hope
              that a variety of nanoparticle-impregnated materials will be developed based
              upon nanoparticle modification techniques.

The commercial applications for
              this technology will be to the telecommunications, photonics, and sensor
              technologies.  The networking market alone will benefit greatly from this
              technology.
