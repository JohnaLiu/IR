Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
              distributed traffic-management algorithms applied to overlay networks of
              Semantic Routers constituting a high-speed Semantic Web.  Semandex Networks is
              pioneering new categories of information routers based on eXtensible Markup
              Language (XML).  These routers automatically know where content is and to where
              to deliver it, dramatically reducing information breaks.  A hierarchy of edge
              and core application-layer routers interconnect for scalable, accurate, and
              timely information delivery, in a manner that could not otherwise be
              economically or technically realized.  Traffic management in this real-time
              heterogeneous system presents new challenges that cannot be solved by
              traditional link-based point-to-point approaches.  Specifically, the bandwidths
              of the underlying links are shared with other layer-3 traffic of unknown
              characteristics, and outputs from individual virtual ports are aggregated over
              the outgoing link or links from an individual layer-7 router. 

Commercial
              application for this project is that flow and management issues needed to
              enhance next generations Internet structures will be tractable therefore
              reducing downtimes and increasing net performance.
