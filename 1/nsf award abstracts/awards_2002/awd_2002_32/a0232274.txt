Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
              the two primary barriers to the commercialization of super-resolution video
              enhancement, namely, that (1) the motion compensation-based video enhancement
              algorithms are extremely computationally-intensive, and (2) the ability to
              extract additional visual information from digital video is highly dependent on
              image sequence content.  Provided that people, objects, and entire scenes move
              in subpixel increments between video   frames or fields, this motion can be
              exploited by temporally integrating neighboring pictures to increase spatial
              resolution and to actually see details where there were once blocky pixels. 
              The proposed research focuses on determining the feasibility of significantly
              increasing the processing speed of the associated numerical algorithms on
              desktop and notebook personal computers running Microsoft Windows or Linux, as
              well as determining the feasibility of automatically detecting the video
              frames/fields which contribute additional information to a specific
              region-of-interest selected for enhancement.

A number of commercial
              applications in forensic image analysis for law enforcement and security
              end-users can be developed around this technology.  Super resolution video
              enhancement is of particular interest to government agencies, such as the
              Department of Defense and the Department of Justice for extracting additional
              details from reconnaissance and   surveillance video, as well as to the private
              sector for forensic image analysis in law enforcement, surveillance, and
              security.  By successfully tackling the proposed technical objectives, the
              capability will be developed to embed super-resolution enhancement video
              technology into commercial nonlinear video editing software packages such as
              Adobe Premiere.
