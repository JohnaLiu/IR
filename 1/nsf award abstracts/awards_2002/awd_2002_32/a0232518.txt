Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will lead to the
              fabrication 
process of Bismuth Scantanate-Lead Titanate(BiScO3-PbTiO3)
              ceramics  with  a  textured microstructure  to yield materials  with  very
              large piezoelectric properties over a broad temperature range. In the case of
              existing ceramics, the piezoelectric properties are too low for these
              applications while recently discovered single crystal materials suffer from low
              Curie temperature and high manufacturing costs.  The objective of this research
              is to develop textured ceramics from the BiScO3-PbTiO3 system.  These materials
              have been shown to possess a very high Curie temperature (Tc. >450 C)  and high
              piezoelectric properties suitable for meeting the needs of emerging sensor,
              transducer,  and  actuator applications.  The templated grain  growth method
              will be used as  a means of texturing microstructure to produce polycrystalline
               ceramics  with  properties  close  to  those  of  single  crystal.
   
              
Commercially, piezoelectric ceramics and single crystals are tantalizingly
              close to enabling a broad range of advanced applications including  vibration 
              sensors  with  sensitivity  at  the  theoretical  limit,  two-dimensional
              ultrasound phased arrays for three dimensional volumetric imaging,  and  high
              authority actuators for smart structures (vibration control and surface
              morphing).  This program will lead to highly piezoelectrically active material
              produced at nearly the same cost as existing ceramic compositions.
