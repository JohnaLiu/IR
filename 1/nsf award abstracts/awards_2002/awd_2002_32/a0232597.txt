Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              novel material, Bio-Carbon Nano-Tube (BCNT), for a neural prosthetic
              application. The project involves a highly innovative approach, which uses a
              surface-engineered nanostructured silicon wafer as a template to grow the
              desired BCNT material. In this way, the carbon nanotubes nucleate will grow in
              a specific alignment due to the restrictions set by the size and shape of the
              nano-structured silicon matrix.  Also, the project will investigate the
              feasibility of forming BCNT material on nanostructured porous silicon
              substrates and will conduct in-vitro studies on nerve cell function and fibrous
              scar tissue formation.  Subsequent work will optimize the growth process for
              BCNT and conduct systematic studies aimed at demonstrating the medical, and
              possibly industrial, applications of the proposed functional nanostructured
              material.

Commercially, the material is expected to perform many functions,
              in particular,  as a neural prosthetic material to bridge damaged areas of the
              central and peripheral nervous systems in patients with neurological disorders.
              Preliminary studies conducted using existing nano-carbon tube technology, have
              had limited success due to the lack of control on growth of aligned nanotubes
              with desired size, shape, and electrical properties. The current approach will
              overcome these limitations.
