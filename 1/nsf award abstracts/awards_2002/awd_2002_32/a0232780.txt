Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate
              the feasibility of an innovative, environmentally benign, enzymatic catalyst
              process and an advanced reactor design for the production of silicon esters
              from various feedstocks. All current processes for making silicon esters are
              either using expensive rare earth metal as catalysts or using halogen elements
              containing compounds as starting materials and high temperature. Some of them
              involve using or generating HCl gas and the formation of complex mixtures,
              which cannot be readily separated. The Phase I objective is to demonstrate
              feasibility of using immobilized enzyme as a catalyst for silicon ester
              synthesis coupled with the sonic-enhanced packed bed reactor technology. The
              investigation will focus on esterification reactions between alkyl silanols and
              saturated or unsaturated carboxylic acids to produce silicon esters with
              designed degree of saturation.
      This enzymatic process will produce both
              saturated and unsaturated silicon esters that can be used for a broad range of
              applications, that include repellent coatings, contact lenses, electrical
              assemblies, perfumes, dyes, brake fluid, chromatography equipment, rubber
              products, products to reattach detached retinas and more. The unsaturated
              esters can also be used as monomers for silicon containing polymer
              production.
