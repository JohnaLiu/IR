Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
              the effect of carbon nanotubes on the photoconductivity of electroactive
              polymer matrix composites and on their performance and sensing efficiency.
              Several formulations of additives/polymer(s), including functionalized carbon
              nanotube systems, have potential to interact selectively, sensitively, and
              reversibly with trace analytes in the electroactive matrix.  Nanotube-polymer
              sensing probes based on conductivity changes or mechanical force fluctuations
              exerted by the surrounding media, will be developed and tested for their
              sensitivity, reversibility, fast response to different analytes, and chemical
              and environmental stability. Superior formulations will be tested and compared
              to existing commercial sensing materials. 
 
Commercially, conventional metal
              oxide and polymer based sensors are usually impractical at ambient temperature
              due to low sensitivity. The combination of advanced conformal coating processes
              and advanced formulations of  nanotube/polymers has the potential to alleviate
              the sensitivity and response to inorganic, organic, and biological analytes. 
              These  low  cost ultra-light weight nanotube-polymer composite films with
              improved  structural, stability and electrical properties will be important 
              for  portable sensor applications.
