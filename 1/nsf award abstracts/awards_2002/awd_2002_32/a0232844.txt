Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project applies Infolenz'
              proprietary model-reduction technology to the development of a data-driven
              economic framework for supporting a firm's offer design.  The objectives of the
              project are: 1) development of a modeling methodology capable of handling the
              complexity of enterprise transaction data, 2) development of a robust
              integrated offer design methodology, 3) prototyping the methods in software,
              and 4) applying them to actual client data.   

The resulting commercial
              application emerges in a tool that automatically integrates the strategic
              decisions of business users with the economic information gleaned from
              transaction data to design optimal offers. The proprietary model-reduction
              technique of the proposer represents a missing link that can now support the
              development of a practical theory of robust modeling and control of these
              complex economic systems that is truly data-driven.
