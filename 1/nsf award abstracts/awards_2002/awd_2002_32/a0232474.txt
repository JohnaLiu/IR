Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will
              identify materials with desirable properties and performance standards.   
              Rapid advances in communication technology, flight-based transportation,
              medical components and military strategy due to rapidly changing global
              alliances is pushing a need for materials that goes beyond current
              capabilities.  This project will use advanced 3D fabrication techniques to
              produce innovative materials that mimic bio-based shell structures. 
     The
              commercial and broader impacts of this technology could lead to a commercial
              product with unique properties.   The project will expand the capabilities of
              digital and rapid manufacturing, two areas that this country must push forward
              in, if the country is to maintain any sort of dominance in worldwide
              manufacturing.
