Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at
              developing diagnostics for liquid fuel combustion systems. The proposed
              instrumentation will provide a noninvasive measurement of liquid volume,
              surface area and velocity within a cross-sectional plane of the dense spray.
              The technique is applicable to burning and non-burning sprays and is equally
              effective for spherical and non-spherical drops and particles. The proposed
              device is a novel combination of ensemble laser diffraction and image
              correlation velocimetry, both of which are well-developed technologies and many
              practical issues concerning their implementation have been already resolved.
              The goal of the project is to build a bench-top system and prove the underlying
              concepts. A number of issues concerning the effectiveness of the proposed
              diagnostics in the combustion environment will also be addressed.

The broad
              impact of this work will be commercialization of a new diagnostics tool that
              may enable cleaner and more efficient liquid fuel combustion systems.
