Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will investigate
              the use of a fast switching ferroelectric liquid crystal structure,
              particularly in the inverse twisted smetic structure (ITSS) to make a
              polarization insensitive diffraction grating structure. This will be done using
              the high tilt ferroelectric liquid crystal material. In this program two
              different approaches will be explored to make a polarization insensitive beam
              deflector. In one approach, a fast switching ferroelectric liquid crystal in
              combination with doped cross-linking agents will be used to make a switchable
              grating without the use of holography. A second approach will make the
              polarization insensitive structures using patterned alignment layers. The
              optimal method will be identified for further development and
              implementation.

Commercially these diffractive structures are expected to
              form the basis of optical attenuators as well as beam steering devices.
              Although several applications, such as optical light attenuators for the
              telecommunications industry can be expected, the ultimate application as always
              will depend on the performance of the device.
