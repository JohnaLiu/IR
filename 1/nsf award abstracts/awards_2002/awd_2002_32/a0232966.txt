Abstract    :
                  The goal of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project
              is to determine the feasibility of leveraging existing weather and
              communication systems to provide location-specific, detailed, automatic, and
              continuous weather information nationwide to the general public.  The project
              will determine the feasibility of using an existing nationwide communication
              system in a novel manner to augment regional weather broadcasts. It will also
              determine the features and capabilities that must be included to make the
              commercial system user friendly and autonomous. 
    The commercial
              implementation of this research is expected to provide the traveling public
              with weather information presented by portable units suitable for personal use
              in automobiles, aircraft, and pleasure boats.
