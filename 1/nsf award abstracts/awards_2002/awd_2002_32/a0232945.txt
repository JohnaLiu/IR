Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop
              and test a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant)-based software that will facilitate
              bird identification in the field by combining geographic information with
              images, audio, and descriptive data.  The proposed software will facilitate
              research and educational activities by allowing multiple users to collate their
              observations via the desktop version of this software.  Rather than being
              locked into one platform, the application will be designed for efficient
              transfer across both Palm OS and Pocket PC platforms. The specific platform
              decision for Phase I will be made in the initial stages of design after
              re-evaluation of existing technology. In Phase I, South Dakota Health
              Technology Innovations, Inc. in collaboration with the University of South
              Dakota, proposes to develop and test a prototype system for 100 South Dakota
              birds. The research team will work with the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology
              to establish appropriate links between this software and their BirdSource
              website, and to coordinate with Citizen Science programs. The three main
              selling points of this application will be the mobility offered by the PDA, the
              access to multimedia and GIS data in the field, and the potential for building
              an interactive community of naturalists. 
     The  software will provide for
              the first time, mobile access to multimedia data on birds via the PDA. It is
              expected that this integration of data on the PDA will be purchased by and
              greatly benefit educators, communities of birdwatchers, and researchers.
