Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will assist in the
              development of an 
innovative method for effective and low cost destruction
              and removal of hazardous air 
pollutants (HAPs), specifically Halogenated
              Volatile Organic Compounds (HVOCs), 
using non-thermal plasma generated in
              microwave discharges.  In the non-thermal 
technique described in this
              proposal, the non-equilibrium properties of the plasma are 
fully exploited. 
              These plasmas can produce energetic electrons (typical energies of 1-10 
eV),
              which effectively lead to the creation of free radicals without the necessity
              of adding 
the enthalpy associated with very high gas temperatures. 
              Therefore, from the chemical 
point of view, destruction reaction rates
              normally associated with temperatures of 10,000 
to 100,000 K can be realized
              with the gas near ambient temperature.  The proposed 
technique utilizes the
              dissociation and ionization of the background gases to produce 
radicals that,
              in turn, destroy and decompose the toxic and hazardous compounds.  The 
input
              energy of the system is directed mostly to the production of the desired
              density of 
radicals which react preferentially with the HVOCs that are often
              present in very small 
concentrations in the exhaust gas.   
 
The proposed
              technology will meet a growing need in the semiconductor industry, and 
other
              HVOC sources for a simple and cost-effective method for the removal of
              hazardous 
compounds from the flue gas.  The new method is likely to be
              successful due to its 
simplicity and the ease with which the gas-cleanup unit
              can be retrofitted to the existing 
combustion systems.
