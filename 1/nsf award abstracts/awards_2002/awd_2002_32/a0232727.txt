Abstract    :
              The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the
              development of 
novel lithium based cathode materials for high discharge rate
              applications. Significant attempts have been made in the past decade to
              commercialize lithium manganospinels but have met with limited success due to
              poor cycle life and low rate dischargeability.  Proprietary synthesis
              technologies have been developed to stabilize defective lithium manganospinels,
              which in thin film form, exhibit high capacity (> 230 mAH/g), long cycle life(>
              700 cycle) and high discharge rates (> 25C). These materials have been
              fabricated using a special Vapor Phase Activated Oxygen (VPAO) method.  This
              project proposes to explore the feasibility of the VPAO method to synthesize
              bulk electrodes for high discharge rate applications. Two methods will be
              explored using the VPAO techniques: (i) direct scale-up of the thin film
              technology to thick films and (ii) synthesis of defective manganospinel powders
              by gas phase nucleation process. 

Li-based batteries are presently used in
              low power applications.  Success of the proposed research will allow lithium
              batteries to capture the market for high-powered applications such as power
              tools and electric vehicles, as well as the portable batteries market.
