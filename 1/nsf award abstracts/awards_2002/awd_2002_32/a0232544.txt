Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a
              novel temperature-adaptive nano-crystalline combinatorial self-lubricating
              coating for cutting tools. Solid lubricant and hard phase combinatorial coated
              tools have significant potential application for machining applications.
              Currently available self-lubricating coatings have a soft lubricant phase
              deposited over a hard phase. The soft phase quickly wears out leaving the under
              layer of hard phase without lubrication. Also, todays lubricant coatings do not
              offer temperature adaptability. Both of these problems are addressed will be
              addressed in this project. 
    The commercial potential of this project will
              be tools that have an extremely wear-resistant nano-composite coatings which
              will increase the life of a tool.  This technology will have siginificant
              impact on the cutting tool and die industries.
