Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a new
              robot architecture targeting fine-fidelity, force dependent tasks. The project
              will use an innovative 2 degree-of-freedom manipulator with lightweight
              construction and smooth, low friction joints. The control system follows the
              biological model of sensing the environment by touch and performing work by
              applying force. The project will test the validity of a manipulator concept by
              constructing a simple unit and attempting a task commonly required of cast
              metal parts, such as grinding excess material left by the casting process to
              produce a smooth surface. Successful results can be applied to more
              sophisticated manipulators for automating the finishing of cast, forged, and
              molded parts. The concept can also be extended to other labor intensive
              industrial processes that are difficult and hazardous for people to perform.
              Further, its more natural mode of operation could permit it to safely work in
              close concert with people, including the physically impaired.
     The
              potential commercial applications include automated finishing of fabricated
              parts, including grinding, deburring, polishing, and blending. Automated
              assembly of closely fitting parts. Robots that can work in close proximity, and
              provide assistance to, human laborers as well as the physically impaired.
