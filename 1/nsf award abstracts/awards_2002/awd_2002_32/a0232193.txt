Abstract    :
              The awardee will construct and deploy two eight-panel radars as the next step in
              the continuing engineering development of the Advanced Modular Incoherent
              Scatter Radar (AMISR).  These radars will use production-level hardware, as
              opposed to the engineering prototype subassemblies constructed for earlier
              development efforts.  The proposed deployment locations in Gakona, Alaska and
              Jicamarca, Peru will allow testing the radar hardware in actual operating
              conditions, using realistic pulse patterns and data acquisition algorithms. 
              The locations were chosen because they each provide coherent scatter targets of
              scientific interest and with anticipated return strengths that should be
              readily detectable by the smaller radars.  The two locations are also ideal in
              that they represent two very different environmental conditions, providing a
              good test of system integrity.  Furthermore, they both have sufficient local
              infrastructure to keep the deployment costs reasonable.  This project will help
              reduce risk and enhance capability for future construction and deployment of
              incoherent scatter radars based on the AMISR design.
