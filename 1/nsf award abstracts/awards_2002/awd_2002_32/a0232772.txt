Abstract    :
                         This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project explores a
              new way to authenticate the identity of a remote computer user.  While
              anonymity is often an attractive feature of online experience, it creates
              problems for both host and visitor. Anonymity impedes important functions:
              financial transactions, information access, secure decision-making, etc.  Proof
              of identity enables such action.  Existing technologies--passwords, signatures,
              electronic keys, digital certificates, physiological biometrics, etc.--all
              address this problem.  Each is limited by constraints including hardware
              requirements, immobility, ease of forgery, ease of transfer, etc.  The approach
              offers clear advantages.  Like password protection, it requires no special
              hardware, it is readily deployed, and noninvasive.  Passwords can be stolen,
              forgotten or compromised.  Not so this technique.  Like retinal scanning, it
              identifies individual humans, not secret keys.  In this study, biometric data
              will be collected non-invasively from a broad population of computer users. 
              Statistical analysis and signal processing techniques will be applied to
              isolate the metrics that reliably identify individuals.
     The applications
              of such technology are manifest.  This will focuses on one significant
              application: online credit card authorization.  It establishes milestones on
              the path to a system by which an authorized cardholder can easily make credit
              card purchases anywhere on the web, but nobody else can--even when having the
              actual card in hand.
