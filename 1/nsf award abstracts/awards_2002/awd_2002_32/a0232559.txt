Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a
              Micro-Force Test Apparatus inside a Scanning Electron Microscope to better
              learn the micromechanical properties of materials and MEMS devices. The project
              will explore mechanical properties of MEMS devices as well as individual phases
              in metals.  The properties to be explored are compressive strength, shear
              strength, tensile strength, flex, and peel. In addition, microgrippers will be
              added to the end of the linear motion feed though.  This addition will allow
              for assembly of other components using various attachment techniques including
              thermoset polymer adhesives, solders and brazes. 
      The potential
              commercial application for the Microforce Testing System and fixtures will be
              to characterize materials such as metals and ceramics and MEMS-type devices.
