Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and
              demonstrate an attachment interface for an advanced carbon composite
              transmission conductor for electrical power. The attachment will interface with
              existing power transmission hardware and techniques. In the project the tasks
              will involve reviewing existing techniques for composite cable connections,
              possibly from other industries; initial design and analysis of interface
              hardware; fabrication of hardware and structural testing; evaluation of test
              reults and recommendations for  final design including field installation
              considerations.

Commercially, the advantages of an advanced carbon composite
              transmission conductor are the lower weight and higher power capacity over
              conventional bare overhead conductors. The weight savings will allow for a
              higher packing density on existing transmission towers. This higher packing
              density will ease or eliminate the need for new power transmission
              right-of-ways, which are difficult to obtain. The higher power capacity will
              allow for higher peak power delivery during power crisis and avoiding power
              transmission bottlenecks over conventional conductors.
