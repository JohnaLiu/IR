Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate
              polarization
effects in mono-layers of evaporative deposited prolate metal
              nano-spheroids in order to
fabricate low-cost, high performance polarizing
              optical coatings. Recent investigations of nano-spheroid arrays have resulted
              in a major technical innovation for achieving high
performance polarization in
              the spectral region from 1300 nm to 1650 nm. Techniques for fabricating these
              polarizing  nano-spheroid (PNS) layers will be investigated in order to
              demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating near-IR polarizing coatings. The
              research effort will consist of assembly of test equipment for precision
              characterization of the nano-spheroids, development of PNS mono-layers with
              high performance characteristics, encapsulation of the PNS layers in a
              dielectric matrix and demonstration of a multi-layer PNS polarizing coating.
              

Commercially, a high performance PNS polarizing coating will provide a
              low-cost alternative to expensive glass polarizers now used in Optical Fiber
              Communications components including optical isolators, high-frequency
              modulators, and fiber tip coatings for Metro and Home optical fiber links.
