Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project in Information-Based
              Technology will develop a user-friendly yet powerful software package that
              enables users to import marine or fresh water optical data in commonly used
              formats; process the data with a variety of ecological and radiative transfer
              inversion models to derive essential physical, chemical, and biological
              descriptions of the water column; and view/export the resulting information in
              convenient digital and graphical formats.  

This software will be the tool
              that connects commercial optical instrumentation and recently developed
              radiative transfer models with the large communities of oceanographers, ocean
              color remote sensing researchers, and water-quality and aquatic-resource
              managers.
