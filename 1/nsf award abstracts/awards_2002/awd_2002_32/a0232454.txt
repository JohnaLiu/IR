Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project will initiate
              creation of a capability termed Spider Explorer Data Visualization. This
              project will explore new means for organizing, exploring, and visualizing large
              data sets by incorporating into a fundamental presentation format, the spider
              diagram, innovative hierarchical capabilities and a supporting data management
              tool set. The project team will research, develop, and integrate innovative
              data exploration and visualization capabilities with emphasis on hierarchical
              structures and data normalization. The foremost benefits will result from an
              unprecedented ability to explore and organize large data sets and thus achieve
              levels of comprehension not possible with current methods. The objective is to
              enable humans, with their finite cognitive resources, to effectively organize
              and absorb copious amounts of data. The impact of such a capability will be
              significant, and the potential benefits span many domains including scientific
              research, economic growth, productivity, and education.
      Commercial
              potential is broad ranging and has strong potential for domains including
              scientific research, manufacturing and production, financial analysis, and
              engineering.
