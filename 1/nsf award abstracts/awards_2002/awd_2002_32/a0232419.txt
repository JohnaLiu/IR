Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on  synthesis
              methods to bring the cost of perflurocyclobutyl  (PFCB) containing polymers to
              commercially practical levels.  PFCBs are exciting photonic materials due to
              their breakthrough optical performance and manufacturing characteristics of low
              optical transmission loss, high Tg, broad refractive index tailorability, and
              excellent melt and solution processability.  Optical performance is tailored
              based on the fluorine content and backbone structure of the polymer, making
              synthesis innovation of this family of photonic materials critical to achieving
              unique performance and commercial availability.  

The photonic materials
              market is projected to grow significantly due to the step change in performance
              for electronic materials. Commercialization will be achieved through sale of
              the polymer into the optical device market.
