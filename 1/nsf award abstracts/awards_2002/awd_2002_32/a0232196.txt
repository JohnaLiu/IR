Abstract    :
              This project is to provide for the activities of the Coupling, Energetics and
              Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) Science Steering Committee and the
              production of the CEDAR Post newsletter.  The Steering Committee provides
              leadership for the program and advice to the National Science Foundation
              program officers who manage it.  The main functions are to organize the annual
              workshop and to review the scientific progress of the program.  Funds are
              requested to defray the costs of committee meetings and the production and
              mailing of the CEDAR Post.
