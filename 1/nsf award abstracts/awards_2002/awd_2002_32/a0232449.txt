Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide
              practical tools for visualizing real-time road traffic data and
              computer-generated traffic simulations using 2D and 3D animation for broadcast
              and the Internet.  Except for weather forecasts, data-driven animations are
              rarely produced in real-time from live data. Traffic visualization contains
              more challenges than weather visualization.  The objective of this project is
              to determine the feasibility of building practical, fully functional tools to
              access data in a timely fashion and produce a compelling animation within
              seconds. This tool must model traffic incidents and flow in a timely and
              accurate fashion.  The  anticipated result includes animation and
              video-production tools that will be converted to a commercial product during
              Phase II.

Potential applications include TV broadcasts, traffic control
              centers, police dispatch centers, and visualization tools for transportation
              studies and planning.  In addition, the animation principles derived from this
              project could be applicable to visualizing other real-time data in an
              animation.  The first application is broadcast television, for morning traffic
              segments.  Further applications include traffic control centers, dispatches,
              and tools for transportation planning. A third domain of application is
              information dissemination on small-screen displays (PDA, etc) when the
              bandwidth and market materialize.
