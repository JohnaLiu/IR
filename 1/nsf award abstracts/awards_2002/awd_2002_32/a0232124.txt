Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate
              the problem of generating intelligent behavior in complex settings.  The need
              for generating such behavior is evidenced in many areas, including game
              playing, business operations, and military engagements.  The objective of the
              research is to identify suitable means for a self-adaptive system to explore
              alternative possible allocations of resources and to learn how to respond to
              stimuli with only minimal human intervention.  The research will focus on the
              combination of evolutionary computation and neural networks, and, in
              particular, will include object networks that examine subsections of a scene
              and are combined to render a decision regarding the appropriate course of
              action.  The anticipated results include the identification of appropriate
              methods for evolving these complex object neural networks, as well as the
              suitability of the results for direct application in commercial markets,
              particularly in the area of software entertainment
     The possible
              commercial applications include strategic assessment of dynamic combat
              environments, optimization of business operations in supply-chain management
              and logistics, and the development of intelligent opponents in video games. 
              Natural Selection, Inc plans to focus on video game products as the most direct
              method for bringing the research to a commercial application with significant
              impact.
