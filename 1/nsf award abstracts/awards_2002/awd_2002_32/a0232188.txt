Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate
              the feasibility of developing temporal extensions to a commercial Geographic
              Information System (GIS).  In many fields, temporal information is a key part
              of the domain models.  For instance, a demographer studying population changes,
              an environmental biologist investigating migration patterns, or a public
              official looking for patterns of criminal activity all need a system that can
              work with data that have both spatial and temporal dimensions.  Temporal
              extensions would leverage the strength of an existing GIS system and market
              demand for spatio-temporal support is growing, but response by GIS vendors has
              been minimal.

The research will lead to the development of a marketable
              product in the form of extension software to be sold to current and future
              customers of existing GIS systems.  The range of application includes natural
              resource management, meteorology, agriculture, health, archeology, crime
              detection and prevention, urban development, and other applications in
              government, military, and corporate environments.
