Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to develop,
              deploy, and evaluate a virtual reality-based modeling kit, called Contagious
              Disease Modeling (CDM) Toolkit, which will enable students to build virtual 3-D
              models of viruses and bacteria within a web-based inquiry framework.  This
              system will enable students to explore fundamental questions of virus/bacteria
              trajectories, infection methodologies, public health strategies, and
              treatments.  Built on a simulation of virtual people's activity in the home
              (similar to The Sims game, where one can set up a household, define the
              character traits of the residents, and control their interactions), students
              will create models related to infectious diseases: models of viruses and
              bacteria that will infect the virtual people, models of immune system and
              treatment interventions that will fight viruses and bacteria, and models of
              behavior that will enact public safety recommendations.  Research has shown
              that students do not effectively blend lectures, 2-D static images, and textual
              descriptions of scientific phenomena.  Building virtual reality models is the
              right match for the content and builds deep understanding of the 3-D nature of
              science concepts and the inquiry skills of model based science.  This
              instructional approach and base technology,  by Cybernet Systems, has the
              potential to open up an entirely new mode of instruction that will be
              extendable to many other mathematics, science, and technology domains.
    
              The market will be middle school life science, high school, undergraduate and
              graduate biology, graduate public and environmental health, and professional
              medical-related programs including medicine and nursing.
