Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to
              investigate the design of learning objects that are intelligent,
              activity-based, accessible and reusable.  Intelligent tutoring systems have
              been shown to be instructionally effective in mathematics, science, and writing
              instruction.  Intelligent tutoring systems, however, are often not practical
              due to the costs and resources required to design, develop, and evaluate them. 
              The goal of this effort is to enhance the capability of instructional
              developers by creating intelligent learning objects that can be used in
              intelligent tutoring systems across domains in multiple science education
              learning environments.  The plan is to analyze skill-based science instruction
              to determine functional requirements for reusable learning objects; to design
              and develop one intelligent, activity-based learning object; to demonstrate its
              application in two science domains; and to develop preliminary design and use
              guidelines.

The long-term goal of the project is to improve science
              education by making instructionally effective, intelligent technologies more
              commercially feasible.  Commercialization plans are to market an Internet-based
              tutoring system for biology/microbiology high school and community college
              science departments; reuse the intelligent learning objects in the development
              of other intelligent learning environments; and license the intelligent
              learning objects to other educational software developers.
