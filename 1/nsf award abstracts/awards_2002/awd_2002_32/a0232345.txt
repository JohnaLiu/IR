Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on
              applied research. The goal is to create a commercial Web-Based International
              Trade Knowledge Discovery System based on the TurboRAD Inc. innovative
              copyrighted software also known as TradingCubeTM. TradingCube is a Web Based
              Large Scale Information Application requiring only a standard browser to be
              used. With TradingCube, a decision maker can easily navigate the dynamic
              analysis of world markets for a wide range of product groups as well as
              specific products. TradingCube enables the functionality of a novel combination
              of tools including data management technologies, web technologies, knowledge
              discovery, econometrics and statistics. It requires the creation, storage,
              retrieval, and display of large volumes of international trade information
              effectively and efficiently. TradingCubeTM provides an intuitive interface and
              rapid results expressed in textual and graphic ways that do not require
              specialized knowledge to be understood by the user.
     The potential market
              includes any commercial, private or public enterprise or entity with the need
              to evaluate international trade opportunities.
