Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop optical
              fiber sensors for the quantitative measurement of humidity and air flow for use
              in 
medical diagnostics for breathing.  Initial research indicates that these
              physically small and mechanically robust sensors respond over a wide range of
              relative humidities, with a response time of microseconds, orders of magnitude
              faster than commercially available devices. In the project, a molecular-level
              electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) processing method will be used to form
              multilayered, interleaved metal nanocluster and polymer thin films on the
              distal ends of optical fibers to form the sensors.  The project will involve
              work with a biomedical institute partner to develop  the sensor thin film
              chemistries with improved response, and to design and fabricate the optical
              fiber sensor support instrumentation system. The Optical Science and
              Engineering Research Center at Virginia Tech will  assist in thin film
              materials analysis and optical device testing. 

Commercially, these small,
              rugged, intrinsically safe, ultra-fast optical fiber-based humidity and air
              flow sensors offer an attractive and low-cost approach to breathing diagnostics
              for both clinical research and home health care. Additional large markets for
              similar sensors exist in the industrial gas flow, automotive and transportation
              areas.
