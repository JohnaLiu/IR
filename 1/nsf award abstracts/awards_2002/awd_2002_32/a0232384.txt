Abstract    :
                  This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will address the
              problem of creating robust and efficient software for the solution of
              large-scale nonlinear optimization problems. Taking advantage of recent
              advances in algorithm design, the project will investigate novel versions of
              both interior-point and active-set methods for nonlinear optimization, and will
              examine an innovative integrated approach that takes advantage of both methods
              to achieve greater speed and reliability than are available from current
              single-method codes. Optimization software resulting from this research is
              expected to have commercial applications to difficult nonlinear problems in
              such areas as network planning, optimal power flow, computer-aided design, and
              aerospace engineering, as well as in applications for decision analysis in such
              areas as finance and revenue management.
    Broader impacts of the activity
              include enhanced understanding of optimization techniques that play a key role
              in engineering and commerce; an advance for NSF's educational goals by
              providing support to a postdoctoral researcher; and commercial software
              products whose further development can be supported by sales revenues.
