Abstract    :
              
This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project entitled " Electron
              Beam
Curing of Polymer Interlayer in Silicon Carbide Joints" will develop the
              technology to
enable economical commercialization of silicon carbide
              components. Current joining techniques are too time consuming to be
              economically viable for commercialization and mass production They tend to
              produce excessive polymer shrinkage and thus require excessive number of
              polymer infiltrations. 
The proposed pulsed electron beam curing technology
              will remove these obstacles by
completing the polymer cross-linking in the
              microsecond time scale, which is comparable
to the duration of the electron
              beam pulse. In this Phase I effort, the polymer shrinkage
in the interlayer
              material will be studied first by subjecting it to electron beam
              irradiation.
The resulting samples will be compared to those processed under
              conventional method,
i.e., without undergoing electron beam processing. This
              will then be followed by the
production of SiC joints. These joined test
              samples, produced with electron beam curing,
will again be compared to a
              control joint sample. Computer simulation code will be used
to guide the
              experiments.

Success of this project will pave the way for
              commercializing
SiC components in many different industrial and manufacturing
              markets, including
petrochemical, semiconductor, heat-treating and
              heat-exchanger systems, aircraft and
terrestrial gas turbines, and aircraft
              structural components.
