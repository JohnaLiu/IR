Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an
              optimized manufacturing process for new robust, high efficiency, polymer piezo
              actuators and transducers based on polyvinylidene di-fluoride (PVDF) - carbon
              nanotube nanocomposites. These new actuators and transducers have recently been
              demonstrated in the laboratory and have shown a remarkable 300-500 %
              performance improvement over current technology. It appears they can be made
              with the same or lower cost using existing extrusion manufacturing techniques.
              In the proposed project scale-up strategies for low cost manufacture and
              commercialization will be examined particularly in terms of how they impact the
              performance of the actuator or transducer. Comparisons will be made to
              commercially relevant standards to identify the optimal process. 
   
              Commercially, these materials are used in a variety of applications, such as
              switches, computer graphics, infrared detectors, ultrasonic medical imaging,
              musical instrument pickup, hydrophones, and transducers for military and
              civilian sonar applications. The transducer composite and polymer film market
              equaled $222 million in 2000, and is expected to grow  to $340 million by 2005.
