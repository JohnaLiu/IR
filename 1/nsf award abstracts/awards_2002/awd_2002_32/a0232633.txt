Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              engineered closed cell ceramic foams, suitable for low temperature processing,
              to replace lower performing metallic and open cell ceramic foams now in
              widespread use. Design specific requirements will be accommodated by ceramic
              selection, porosity control and reinforcement technique. A unique capability to
              be developed is self-healing of cracks to prevent damage to fiber
              reinforcements in hot gas environments. The project includes fluid flow and
              finite element modeling. Samples will be fabricated and mechanical and thermal
              measurements taken to explore material performance sensitivity to key design
              variables. It is anticipated that the research will result in a family of low
              cost, low density, self-healing ceramic foams, with widespread
              application.

Commercially, closed cell ceramic foams will improve the
              performance of high temperature systems used in the power, chemical and
              transportation industries, resulting in three major benefits to society; lower
              process cost, reduced consumption of fossil fuel and lower pollution levels.
