Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will apply novel
              Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) technology for the encapsulating of ultrafine
              particle surfaces used in certain advanced materials for aerospace applications
              and drug delivery. Ultrafine sized iron particles will be nanocoated with
              alumina providing film thicknesses of 50, 25, 12.5, 6.3, 3.2, 1.6, and 0.8
              nanometers. The particle nanocoating will be carried out in a fluidized bed
              process developed at the University of Colorado. The produced particles will be
              characterized for film thickness, particle size distribution, surface area, and
              film coverage uniformity. They will be evaluated for coercivity, remanent
              magnetization, hysteresis loss, and oxidation resistance. Nanocoated iron
              particle filled epoxy composites will be fabricated and tested for
              electromagnetic transmission/reflection.
     Commercially, this powerful and
              versatile processing method can encapsulate ultrafine particles with ceramic
              nanolayers to offer unparalleled control of coating thickness ( 0.1 nm)
              relative to more conventional methods. Such ultrathin, chemically bonded,
              conformal coatings on individual primary particles provide for materials
              opportunities never before realized . Envisioned applications include novel
              ferromagnetic materials for artificial dielectrics for microwave lens antennas,
              radar crossection reduction materials, and drug delivery.
