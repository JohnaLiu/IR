Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              prepreg 
material that, while maintaining the advantages of a powder towpreg
              system, will eliminate the use of high price, finely ground powders.  By
              generating fine particles in situ using aerosol formation from molten polymers
              two steps will be eliminated from the manufacturing process -- powder grinding
              and powder sintering, resulting in greatly reduced cost and complexity of the
              operation.

Commercially, composite materials have an ever growing importance
              in the development of new technologies due to their inherent advantages over
              conventional materials.  These include better strength-to-weight ratios than
              most metals, extreme corrosion resistance, and novel processing techniques,
              which will allow a variety of shapes not achievable by conventional means. 
              However in many cases, the costs for fiber-reinforced composites is five to ten
              times higher than that of base metals like steel or aluminum. This project will
              make the composite  material considerably more cost competitive.
