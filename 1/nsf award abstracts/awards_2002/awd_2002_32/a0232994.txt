Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is focused on
              improving the material properties 
of spray formed titanium shapes using the
              Cold Spray process.  Development of new, low-cost methods 
for direct
              fabrication of spray formed titanium shapes is critical for many industries and
              in particular, for 
manufacturing parts of expensive metals and alloys such as
              titanium.  Direct fabrication technologies 
would have tremendous commercial
              potential for many industries such as the aerospace and automotive 
because
              these technologies hold out the potential to quickly manufacture, and provide
              fast prototyping of 
complicated parts and to fabricate them with minimal
              material waste.   Current methods of spray forming typically involve melting
              and solidification, which can cause high residual stresses, undesirable phases,
              poor microstructures, rough surface finishes, warpage, and other problems. 
              This proposal presents a new technology that is under development that appears
              promising for directly fabricating solid, near-full-density, free-form shapes
              of many metals, at or near room temperature 
without melting and
              solidification.   
      The objective of this Phase I study is to develop a
              low cost technology for spray forming titanium and Ti-
6Al-4V alloy and to
              perform post-test processing on thick-sprayed billets to improve the bulk
              material 
properties to near that of the wrought material.
