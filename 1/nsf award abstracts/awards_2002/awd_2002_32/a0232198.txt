Abstract    :
              The project will investigate the impact of global climate change on future water
              availability.  The research is motivated, in part, by water management issues,
              e.g., the potential of substituted crops/vegetation in mitigating regional
              hydrologic change.  The NCAR Community Climate System Model (CCSM) will be used
              to investigate the interactions between radiative and hydrologic processes. 
              The impact of different radiative forcing due to anthropogenic carbon dioxide
              increases and land-use change scenarios on the water cycle and regional water
              availability will be modeled.  Dr. Molders will integrate the state-of-the-art
              CCSM model for several decades, each time with different land-use and radiative
              forcing configurations, and extract answers from careful analysis of the model
              runs. In addition to providing insights into sustainability issues,
Dr.
              Molders' analysis will provide a rather unique assessment of the hydrologic
              potential of this national modeling resource.  The project findings will lead
              to improved characterization of the regional impacts of global climate change
              over Alaska.  Given the fragility of the Alaskan ecosystem, the research is
              societally relevant.  The project is supported as part of NSF's Water Cycle
              Research effort
