The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
              is pleased to submit this grant proposal. The 2003 IEEE Radar Conference
              (RadarCon03), next in the long-running series of IEEE national and
              international radar conferences, will be held in Huntsville, Alabama from May 5
              to May 8, 2003. The theme for the conference is  "Radar -- Exploring the
              Universe"  in keeping with expanding our vision to include ways that radar
              technology can impact our society, planet Earth, our solar system, and the
              universe in the 21st century through new, creative, and exciting applications. 
              RadarCon03 is co-sponsored by three sub-entities of the IEEE: the Aerospace and
              Electronic Systems Society (AESS), IEEE Region 3, and the Huntsville Section. 
              The RadarCon03 organizing committee is continuing the highly successful Student
              Paper Program. This proposal requests that the National Science Foundation
              provide financial support in the amount of $5,000 for the student paper
              program, specifically for students from U.S. institutions travel expenses.
