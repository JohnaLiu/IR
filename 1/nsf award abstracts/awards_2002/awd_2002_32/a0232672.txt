Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on producing
              novel cellulosic aerogels insulation materials for new construction. This
              project will focus on producing ultra-lightweight cellulose aerogels with
              exceptional high thermal insulation and mechanical performance. In the project
              new cellulosic aerogels will be designed and fabricated. Samples will be
              characterized by scanning electron microscopy and surface area/ pore size
              measurements and then optimized for thermal insulation, mechanical performance
              and hydrophobicity.

Commercially, ultra-lightweight and hard cellulose
              aerogel will be useful not only as thermal insulator material for building
              construction but also as a shock absorbent (military helmet, automobile, etc),
              in clothing and in space suit applications.   Thermal insulation is a major
              industry serving a wide range of residential and industrial application needs.
              Development of a new super-insulation material will maximize fuel efficiency in
              process industries and reduce heating and utility bills in residential markets.
