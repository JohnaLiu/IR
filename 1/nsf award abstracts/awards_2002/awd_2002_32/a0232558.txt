Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will investigate
              the feasibility of generating electricity from existing fires in abandoned coal
              mines and waste banks. These can be high temperature fires (charted in excess
              of 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit) that have been burning for decades and will
              continue to burn long into the future. There are currently over 600 fires
              associated with past coal mining activity. Millions of dollars have been spent
              trying to extinguish these fires only to find that there is no practical and
              cost effective solution. We will drill into burning coal seams and install a
              thermal extraction system that would tap into these unutilized heat sources and
              in turn, convert these otherwise wasted energies into a useful product  
              commercially viable electricity.
      This research may lead to the
              construction of commercial power plants at sites now regarded as unproductive
              liabilities. The generally shallow depths and high temperatures of these fires
              lead to the belief that commercially competitive power plants can be built and
              operated at these sites. These factors, as well as others, should lead to lower
              costs in construction and in higher efficiencies of the power plants as
              compared to already proven power plants in the geothermal industry.
