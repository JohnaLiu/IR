Abstract    :
              This NSF Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program involves the use a
              hydrothermally stable SiC membrane as a membrane reactor for steam reforming.
              We have developed an innovative hydrogen selective SiC membrane. This membrane
              has demonstrated an excellent material stability required for performing
              methane steam reforming and dehydrogenation via a catalytic membrane reactor.
              Thus, we believe that the time is ripe to harvest the catalytic membrane
              reactor technology. We will be able to perform experimental and reaction
              engineering study to demonstrate a commercially viable catalytic membrane
              reactor process using an appropriate membrane under an ideal operating
              condition. We will conduct a bench-top experimental study using this selected
              membrane to demonstrate the benefits of reactive separations for an industrial
              significant reaction, hydrogen production via methane steam reforming. In
              addition, the hydrothermal and chemical stability of the SiC membrane under the
              proposed reaction condition will be experimentally verified. 

The use of
              hydrothermally stable SiC membranes froe reactive separations can overcome the
              key technical barriers preventing the implementation of membrane reactor
              technology in the steam reforming of methane, as well as in dehydrogenation
              applications.  Both are industrially important reaction processes.
