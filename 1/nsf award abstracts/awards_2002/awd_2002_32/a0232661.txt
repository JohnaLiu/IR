Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a
              proof-of-concept, multi-modal Universal Access Web Interface that provides the
              user with a choice between text, speech, and animated American Sign Language
              (ASL).  A representative knowledgebase, encoded using Extensible Markup
              Language (XML) Schema, will be translated into differentiated representations
              in Vcom3D's Character Animation Markup Language (CAML).  CAML, developed under
              a previous NSF SBIR grant, is currently being used in several educational
              products and on Websites (including www.signingavatar.com) to create
              grammatically correct ASL, as well as synthesized speech with correct prosody
              and coordinated gesture and expression. The effectiveness of the
              proof-of-concept Universal Access Web Interface in K-12 educational
              environments will be tested.  Based on successful demonstrations of the
              proof-of-concept , the extensibility of the Interface to more general
              knowledgebase domains will be examined.  In particular, the investigative team
              will evaluate the applicability of Resource Description Framework (RDF),
              Ontology Web Language (OWL), and other Semantic Web initiatives to the creation
              of a standards-based Accessible Semantic Web. 
     The project has potential
              to produce in Software Tools that can be used to economically create e-Learning
              materials that are accessible to both deaf and blind persons. Longer-term
              development, in concert with the emergence of the Semantic Web, can result in
              products that provide general accessibility to Web-based information in
              multiple language modalities.
