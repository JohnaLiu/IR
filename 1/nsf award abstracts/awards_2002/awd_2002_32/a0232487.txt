Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is targeted to save
              semiconductor wafers from being deeply scratched by unchecked large errant
              agglomerates in chemical mechanical planarizing or polishing (CMP) slurries.
              CMP has become the method of choice for restoring the surface trueness of
              wafers at all stages of integrated circuit manufacture. No method currently
              exists that can implement a CMP-safe slurry at the point of use. The proposed
              novel technology of Acoustic Coaxing Induced Microcavitation (ACIM) is a means
              to constructively control acoustic microcavitation and direct its high
              intensity energy implosions at specific particle sites. ACIM will achieve both
              the detection and destruction of the stray large particles and
render the
              entire slurry CMP-safe at the point of use.
     A high-end wafer scratched at
              the final stages of manufacturer results in a large direct loss. Using ACIM to
              save post-CMP wafers is therefore a direct savings. The ACIM Wafer Saver, the
              slurry monitor-comminuter, would be the first fully in-line, real-time, point
              of use device for detecting stray large particles and agglomerates, and for
              reducing them to a nano-fine state. The rapidly growing CMP industry presents a
              well-developed market for this environmentally friendly ACIM tool.
