Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop
              advanced materials for the separation and concentration of germanium and
              gallium from both acidic and basic ore leaches. The primary objective of the
              project will be to develop synthetic routes for grafting polyamines to silica
              particles resulting in composite material that provide an excellent platform
              for immobilizing metal selective ligands on a matrix is resistant to acids and
              bases and elevated temperatures. This should permit germanium and gallium
              loadings and usable materials lifetimes that are superior to current
              technologies.
     The development of more efficient means of extracting these
              metals will result in the exploitation of germanium and gallium deposits in the
              United States that cannot be currently developed due to the limited
              availability of economically viable and environmentally benign ore processing
              protocols
