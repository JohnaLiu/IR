Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will support the
              development and preliminary evaluation of low-cost, high-performance,
              environmentally-clean proton exchange membranes (PEMs).  The project  involves
              the manufacture of PEMs using a patented hot filament chemical vapor deposition
              process, depositing ultra-thin fluorinated sulfonic acid polymer films directly
              onto inexpensive membrane substrates. Structure-property-processing
              relationships will be established and compared with performance with
              commercially-available membranes, measuring electrical conductivity, relevant
              gas/liquid permeability and acid capacity, characterizing chemical composition
              and stability, and identifying the significance of polymerization parameters.
              The results will enable selection of suitable polymer chemistries for
              optimization, aggressive evaluation and testing of the PEMs in membrane
              electrode assemblies (MEAs) in Phase II. Ultimately, rapid, integrated process
              for fabricating composite MEAs through the deposition of multiple functional
              layers will be developed, in a manner analogous to the manufacture of
              microchips. 

The market potential for fuel cells is massive, with PEMs and
              more broadly MEA components constituting a significant portion of the overall
              market share.
