Abstract    :
              This project will develop a new Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer (CIMS)
              instrument adapted to study peroxy radical reactions.  Peroxy radicals are
              important oxidants in the ambient atmosphere and difficult species to measure. 
              Initially, some experiments will be conducted with an existing CIMS instrument
              at the National Center for Atmospheric Research to determine potential
              improvements.  Then a new instrument will be constructed at University of Miami
              and laboratory studies of the uptake of peroxy radicals on surfaces
              representative of ambient atmospheric aerosols conducted using the new
              spectrometer.  Results from this study should improve knowledge on the kinetics
              of gas-surface heterogeneous interactions of oxidatively important peroxy
              radicals on aerosol.  Broader impacts of the research include: a substantive
              addition to current understanding of reactions of peroxy radicals in the
              atmosphere; establishing a state of the art permanent instrument capacity
              enhancement at University of Miami under the direction of a new female faculty
              member; and through the mentoring of postdoctoral scholars and students
              involved on this project promoting scholarship, technology transfer, and
              research experience to a new generation of young scientists.
