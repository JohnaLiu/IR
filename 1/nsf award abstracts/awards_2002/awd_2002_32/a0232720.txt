Abstract    :
              This Small Business  Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the
              process necessary to bring nano-diamond coating technology to the cutting tool
              market. The technical objective of producing  a commercial size lot of
              nano-diamond coated cutting  tools  will  be  accomplished  through 
              application  of  the  hot-filament  Chemical Vapor Deposition process, which is
              the only economical process that produces a uniform diamond coating over
              several hundred square inches in a single batch  operation. The technical 
              approach  will  consist  of  migrating the current  microwave-plasma  CVD
              process to the hot-filament CVD process.  

Commercially, the  immediate 
              application  for  diamond-coated  tools  is  machining  aluminum-based metals
              and composites for the automotive industry. The 2001 automotive cutting-tool
              market for machining these materials was $780M. The potential market for
              applying the diamond coating to these tools is $53M in 2002 with a forecasted
              market growth rate of 4percent so that it is an important development.
