Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes a molecular
              level
electrochemical approach to fabricate semiconductor compounds. It
              targets a
commercially important electro-optic application, the low
              temperature synthesis of
cadmium telluride thin-film for solar cells and
              infrared devices. Present technology uses
expensive vapor phase deposition
              methods that are unsuitable for large-scale or low-temperature
fabrication.
              This project will develop a low-cost, electrochemical process to
produce high
              quality thin-films. Phase I will identify process parameters, demonstrate
              the
proof of concept and validate the approach for deposition of cadmium
              telluride films.
Phase II will extend the method to the other device layers.
              Method implementation will
raise the photovoltaic efficiencies and lower
              manufacturing costs of thin-film modules.
Its success will accelerate the
              large-scale commercialization of this technology and
provide a timely solution
              to the nation's escalating energy and environmental problems.

Commercial
              applications of the Research
Applications for the cadmium telluride thin film
              technology range from the solar cells to
infrared detectors. Lower cost,
              higher efficiencies and simpler manufacturing will
translate into a wider
              spectrum of commercial markets. The nanoscale electrosynthesis
method has
              applications for fabricating a range of novel quantum well structures
              and
devices.
