Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project, Efficient
              Software Implementation of NPP Communications Processor, tests and analyses a
              prototype of a software implementation of a New Peer-to-Peer (NPP) asynchronous
              communication processor, which performs communications coordination in parallel
              with computations.

Three areas of commercial applications for NPP are;
              Massively parallel High Performance Cluster Computing for real-time and
              non-real-time computations, Self-scheduling Parallel Programming with data
              distribution based on data availability, and Network-Oriented applications in
              finance, health, education, business and manufacturing. Efficient software
              implementation of NPP communications processor can dramatically decrease
              asynchronous communication latencies by several orders of magnitude, provide
              tools to dynamically debug and schedule portable parallel software systems, and
              provide infrastructure to produce robust software systems that can evolve
              dynamically. The size of this market opportunity is at least 1.2 trillion
              dollars over the next 10 years. NPP communications processor deployed through
              an API will dramatically impact this market.
