Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              a process to generate bulk quantities of Metallo-Carbohederenes (met-cars). 
              The project will use a particle and deposition technology, called Laser
              Assisted Molecular Beam Deposition, which is ideal for producing met-cars on
              the nanoparticle size scale. The unique structure of the met-cars makes them
              applicable for a variety of applications requiring activated metals.  However,
              to date, in spite of several attempts, no one has been able to produce bulk
              quantities of this material for study and commercialization. 
     The
              commercial and broader impacts of this technology will be the production
              capability for Met-cars nanopowders, which will have a market in the areas of
              activated metal and catalysis and promising applications in the field of
              nanofabrication.
