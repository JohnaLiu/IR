Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an
              approach that combines two new, unique, and complimentary technologies to
              fabricate mesoscopic electronics and sensors. For example, thermal spray as an
              additive process to deposit a wide variety of high-quality ceramic, metal,
              semiconductor, polymer, etc. materials, with the precision subtractive
              capabilities of High-Speed High-Resolution Ultraviolet Laser Micromachining to
              fashion mesoscale (~10-1000 microns) devices on a wide range of substrates. The
              technology is based on a direct-write process that requires no masks,
              photoresist, or wet chemistry. The benefits of such a combined technology are
              vast, and will allow a dramatic reduction in feature size to the ~10 um level
              and below, while being able to utilize an enormous variety of materials and
              perform design iterations in a matter of minutes or hours, compared to the
              traditional 1-4+ week turn-around time for typical photoresist mask
              alterations/fabrication. 

The potential commercial applications are unique
              and far-reaching. Examples include strain gauges, thermistors, thermocouples,
              thermopiles, magnetic and piezoelectric sensors, interdigitated capacitors for
              LCR circuits, antennas, microheaters for integration into chemical and
              biological sensors, and others. The devices can be integrated into existing
              components and embedded or overcoated for added reliability and survivability
              in harsh environments.
