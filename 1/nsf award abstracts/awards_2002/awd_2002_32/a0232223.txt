Abstract    :
                        This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focuses on the
              development of meaningful interactive tutoring and assessment capabilities for
              chemistry tutorial software.  Although there has been a clearly articulated
              user demand for advancement in this area, it has been repeatedly identified as
              one for which existing offerings are weak.  Quantum Simulations a new and
              different approach, adapting and incorporating new concepts from artificial
              intelligence (AI).  More than just assigning a grade, meaningful opportunities
              will be created for students to learn directly from the assessment itself.  The
              proposed technology will benefit all students. The technology, however, is
              specifically targeted to help those who have the greatest need--such as
              students of average or marginal performance and students from historically
              underrepresented groups--by lowering barriers to accessing high-quality science
              instructional software.  The firm has established a partnership with an
              NSF-funded systemic reform initiative to further these goals.
     The
              customers for the proffered technology include textbook publishers, software
              providers, hardware vendors and distance learning companies.   Quantum has
              entered into a long-term contract with a prominent textbook publishe, Holt,
              Rinehart and Winston, to commercialize this technology.  This arrangement will
              result in rapid dissemination to an established end user base.
