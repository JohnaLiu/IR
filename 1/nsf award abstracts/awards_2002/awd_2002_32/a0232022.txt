Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a
              method for
preparation of porphyrin and porphyrin-titanium dioxide (TiO2)
              nanoparticles. Porphyrin and porphyrin-TiO2 nanoparticles are promising
              advanced materials for catalysis, artificial photosynthetic systems, nonlinear
              optical and electronic materials. In initial work, a broad range of porphyrin
              nanoparticles of 10-100nm diameter were prepared by mixing solvent techniques.
              The prepared porphyrin nanoparticles were characterized by DLS, AFM and UV-Vis.
              The prepared porphyrin nanoparticles are stable in air from weeks to months and
              have been successfully transferred to an alumina  (Al2O3) surface. The
              porphyrin nanoparticles were found to have excellent catalytic activities in
              epoxidatin of olefins. The method has been scaled up to prepare 1g scale
              porphyrin nanoparticles. The elegance of the method lies in its simplicity and
              can be economically scaled up to industry scale, which is the subject of this
              project. The preliminary results also show that the agent used to prevent
              agglomeration can be covalently attached to the dye forming the particle or as
              part of the solvent system. 
     The potential commercial application of
              porphyrin and porphyrin-TiO2 nanoparticles will
include epoxidation of
              olefins, partial oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons,
photosynthetic reaction
              centers, novel photonic materials and electronics.
