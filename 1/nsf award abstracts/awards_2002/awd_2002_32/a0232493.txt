Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate
              the development of an innovative liquid combustion process for continuous
              production of nanofluids with suspended unagglomerated metallic and
              non-metallic nanopowders of uniform size and composition. It has been
              demonstrated that fluids containing solid metallic nanoparticles -nanofluids-
              display significantly enhanced thermal conductivities relative to conventional
              heat transfer fluids.     A related goal of this effort is the development of a
              new large-eddy simulation (LES) model for nanoparticle formation and
              aggregation coupled to local Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC)
              simulation models. This numerical tool will be applied to design process
              parameters to produce the desired particle size distribution.  
     The use
              of nanofluids can impact many industrial sectors, including transportation,
              electronics, energy supply, textiles etc. Mostly all the sectors that have
              thermal-management systems will benefit from this project.
