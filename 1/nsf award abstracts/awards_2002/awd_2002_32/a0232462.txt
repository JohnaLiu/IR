Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
              produce low-cost gas diffusion electrodes with integrated flow fields for PEM
              fuel cells used to power next-generation vehicles. The proposed gas diffusion
              electrodes will increase both the power per unit mass and volume, and reduce
              the overall cost of PEM fuel cells. The proposed research would eliminate the
              need for intricate bipolar plates, reducing the weight, complexity and overall
              cost of the PEM fuel cell whilst still maintaining the performance.  Our
              proposed, low-cost, gas diffusion electrodes with integrated flow fields for
              PEM fuel cells will increase both the power per unit mass and volume, and
              reduce the overall cost of the fuel cell. Success of this project will
              accelerate commercialization of fuel cell technology.  

Well over $1 billion
              has been spent on the development of fuel cell technology for next generation
              vehicles (NGVs) alone. The stakes are high and the potential market for viable,
              cost effective fuel cells is immense. Initial applications include micropower
              generators and alternative power systems for NGVs and portable electronic
              equipment.
