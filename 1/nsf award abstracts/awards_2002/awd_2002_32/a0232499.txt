Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a
              process to significantly lower (up to 74%) the cost of forging dies, improve
              die life, and at the same time lower the cost of forgings. The project method
              involves the use of a near-net-shape manufacturing process, called the RCC
              process. This process, once optimized for die applications, will be replacing
              several high energy, expensive steps in the existing methods. The process
              allows localized control of surface chemistry, which can lead to better metal
              flow and die cavity filling, improved resistance to wear and heat checking. The
              process combines the shape capability of investment casting with structural
              uniformity of full-density powder metallurgy, and strength of forgings. The
              process has been used successfully to manufacture several complex shaped
              superalloy, titanium alloy, and stainless steel prototype parts. 
     The
              potential commercial application will be a new die making process.  It is
              projected that an annual cost savings could be as much as $1.2 billion if
              successful.
