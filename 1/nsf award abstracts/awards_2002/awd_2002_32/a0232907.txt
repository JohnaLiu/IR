Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              new method of measuring how strongly a thin film anchors to its substrate. To
              date no method exists that can truly measure thin film adhesion. The Acoustic
              Coaxing Induced Microcaviation (ACIM) deBonder uses controlled microcavitation
              to directly reveal a thin film's adhesion strength by subjecting it to
              controlled erosion. ACIM is a means of constructively controlling acoustic
              microcavitation. By directing ACIM's high intensity energy implosions at
              specific film sites one can quantitatively determine adhesion strength. 

The
              potential commercial benefits will be applicable to any type of film or coating
              that can erode in a controlled manner by cavitation. This technique is a
              nondestructive method that only uses small areas of films. No special sample
              preparation is needed and the method is capable of in situ inspection. 
              Microelectronic manufacturing and the semiconductor industries will benefit
              from this technology.
