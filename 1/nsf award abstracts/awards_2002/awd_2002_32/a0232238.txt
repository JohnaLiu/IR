Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will optimize a newly
              developed ceramic-metallic (cermet) resistive heating material and prove its
              feasibility for use in diesel particulate filters. Objectives include
              optimization of the cermet composition and laminates, characterization of
              physical properties, and development of multi-layer ceramic tape manufacturing
              methods for producing multichannel filter monoliths with integral cermet
              heating elements. The research will optimize the cermet composition based on
              analysis of life and temperature cycling, heat transfer capabilities, and
              thermal gradient control. The anticipated result of the project will be a
              small-scale particulate filter with an integral cermet heating element that
              provides continuous thermal oxidation of particulates. 

The new cermet
              heating material has immediate commercial potential as a heating element that
              can be integrated into diesel particulate filter structures for the continuous
              thermal oxidation of particulates (at approximately 600 C). With new emissions
              controls scheduled to take effect in 2007, there is presently a compelling need
              for a compact, simple-to-maintain, durable, and effective diesel particulate
              filter for both new and existing diesel-powered vehicles.
