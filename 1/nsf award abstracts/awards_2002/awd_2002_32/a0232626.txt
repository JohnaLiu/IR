Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop
              technology to prevent nozzle wear in abrasive water jets used for machining
              (e.g. automotive/aerospace components). Nozzle wear limits the life and
              accuracy of jet cutting and currently requires entrainment of abrasives
              downstream of the nozzle in a larger mixing tube. The new method consists of
              nozzles made of a porous material surrounded by reservoirs containing high
              viscosity lubricant, and exposed to the pressure that drives the slurry in the
              nozzle. This method extends the nozzle life and allows premixing of the
              particles prior to injection (abrasive suspension jets), enabling operation at
              lower pressures, cutting of harder materials and smaller jets (micro
              machining). 
     The commercial potential of using this diverse technology by
              both small machine shops to automotive and aircraft industries is very
              appealing. Wear of the nozzle or mixing tube in present systems is a major
              problem affecting all the applications of jet cutting.
