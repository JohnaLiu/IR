Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will create a
              software system for performing uncertainty analysis of manufacturing process
              models. When the models are large, or when there are many parameters, even the
              best Monte Carlo, or importance based sampling methods for uncertainty analysis
              can be prohibitively expensive. One consequence is that systematic uncertainty
              analyses are often never carried out. This project will implement a new method
              for uncertainty analysis, based on polynomial chaos expansions, that can
              determine the probability density functions of the response and can identify
              which of the parameters contribute most to uncertainties in outcomes. 

The
              commercial potential of this project has broad application to such fields as
              circuit design, risk management, allocation of experimental resources, chemical
              plant design and operation of production systems.
