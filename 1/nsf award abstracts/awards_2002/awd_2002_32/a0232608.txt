Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a process
              for producing high-aspect ratio boehmite nanoscopic platelets.  Boehmite is an
              inexpensive mineral produced in large volumes as a precursor  to alumina 
              catalyst supports.  In the project simple and inexpensive methods for modifying
              the surface of boehmite to render it dispersible in and reactive with a wide
              variety of polymeric matrices will be developed.  
Subtly changing the
              boehmite synthesis conditions and adding morphology-directing compounds  to the
               reaction mixture will achieve the  formation of high 
aspect-ratio boehmite
              platelets.  Particle size and shape will routinely be measured by a
              
combination of x-ray diffraction and light scattering techniques which will,
              in turn, be verified by atomic force microscopy and transmission electron
              microscopy. 
 
The high aspect ratio boehmite developed in this research
              project will result in dramatic improvements  to the barrier properties of its
              composites, leading  to inexpensive nanocomposite barrier  films  for
              packaging, paints and coatings.  Mechanical properties of composites  with
              high-aspect ratio boehmite platelets are also expected to improve.
