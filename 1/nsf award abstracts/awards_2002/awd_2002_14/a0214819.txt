Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              compact source for lithography. As a synchrotron equivalent, this proposal
              presents a single-stepper, XUV or soft-x-ray source, which offers high
              brightness, high collimation, modest operating vacuum, excellent spectrum and
              moderate cost. The x-rays are generated inside a compact betatron by the
              electrons passing through thin radiators made of thin metal foils, crystals or
              multi-layers producing a forward-directed beam of x-rays whose photon energies
              can be XUV, soft and hard x-ray depending upon choice of radiator. As a
              synchrotron mimic, the source can have many applications. For lithography the
              x-ray wavelength can be optimized for highest photo-resist sensitivity, e.g.1.4
              nm. In a proof of principal experiments, tunable monochromatic x-rays from thin
              crystal and multi-layer radiators mounted inside a betatron have been observed.
              Pulse-height spectra were obtained and tuned by rocking the crystal or
              multi-layer relative to the electron-beam direction. We will use our existing
              experimental apparatus to demonstrate high x-ray flux at soft x-ray
              wavelengths.

Potential commercial applications effort will demonstrate the
              capability of generating XUV and x-rays for lithography and crystallography. It
              can also function also as a medical source for imaging and as a laboratory
              source for scientific purposes now relegated exclusively to synchrotrons.
