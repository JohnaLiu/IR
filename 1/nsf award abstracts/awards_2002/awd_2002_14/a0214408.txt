Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop
              sensing instrumentation containing bioengineered surfaces that are compatible
              with relevant, disease-associated proteins. Of particular interest in the
              fields of pharmaceutical design and cell biology is the seven-transmembrane
              segment, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCRs represent a class of
              bioactive proteins that encompass 1-2 percent of all encoded protein within the
              human genome and have been the focus of extensive study in signal recognition
              and propagation within the human body. These receptors, it is estimated,
              comprise up to 70 percent of potential drug candidates. However, a valid
              measurement of protein-protein interactions has been elusive due to the
              technical reliance upon cell extracts or live cellular systems, both of which
              can convolute data. Luna Innovations along with their partners at the
              University of Pennsylvania propose a novel, cell-free system to measure the
              biophysical association between hydrophobic GPCRs and their ligands. The
              proposed optical fiber-based system, based on a lipid bilayer deposition, is
              essential not only to understand the important components of biological systems
              but also to vastly improve the accuracy of contemporary biochip
              measurements.

The commercial applications of this project are in the area of
              biosensor instrumentation. An instrument capable of detecting and
              characterizing protein interactions is expected to have a good market in the
              pharmaceutical industry.
