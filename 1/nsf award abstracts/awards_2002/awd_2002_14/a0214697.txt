Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop
              an efficient and reliable enhanced Raman spectroscopy probe by integrating a
              microspherical resonator with nanoparticles providing Surface Enhanced Raman
              scattering. This spectral information provides a chemical "fingerprint" and
              analyte identification.  However, broader application of this technology is
              hindered by the powerful laser sources and sensitive optical detection
              equipment that the inherently weak Raman scattering requires.  The proposed
              probe addresses these limitations by (1) locally increasing the light intensity
              at the probe head with an optical resonator to permit the use of lower power
              sources and (2) improving the Raman scattering efficiency with metallic
              nanoparticles to permit the use of less sensitive detection equipment.



              Raman spectroscopy has wide commercial application in chemical process
              monitoring, pharmaceutical analysis, and environmental site monitoring because
              it provides rich spectra arising from the chemical structure of the analyte. In
              addition to expanded use in the above-mentioned industries, reducing the cost
              and size of Raman spectroscopy equipment will enable point-of-care systems for
              medical diagnostics and field portable systems for rapid identification of
              chemical unknowns from accidental or intentional releases.
