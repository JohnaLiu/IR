This grant provides support to upgrade the Harvard
              Seismology computing facility in order to facilitate a broad range of research
              in seismology and geophysics. The upgrade will include a fast multiprocessor
              server with large shared memory and a large-volume fast-access disk array. The
              activities supported by the new infrastructure include earthquake studies
              focused around the Harvard CMT project.  An important component of this project
              is the systematic analysis of all earthquakes with magnitudes greater than
              approximately 5.2 around the world, using digital data from globally
              distributed seismographs.  A second component of the supported activities
              involves imaging of the elastic properties of the Earth's interior. This
              research is pursued by development of new data sets and the joint inversion of
              various existing data sets, such as absolute and differential travel times,
              surface-wave dispersion curves, full waveforms, and normal-mode spectra.  The
              upgraded computer facilities will allow a more detailed parameterization of
              Earth structure and a higher fidelity imaging of the Earth's interior.
