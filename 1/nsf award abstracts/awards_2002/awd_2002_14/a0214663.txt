Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
              develop chitosan-derivatives through proprietary chemistries for use as
              additives in oil and gas drilling fluids. For this specific application, it is
              important to tailor the viscoelastic properties of the chitosan derivatives.
              Since little is known about how polymer structure affects  polymer properties,
              a combinatorial approach will be used on this project to screen for the
              viscoelastic properties of the derivatives. Specifically, a high throughput
              mechanical screen will be adapted and examined, with the results from the
              screen correlated with more extensive viscoelastic measurements.

The
              commercial application of this project will be in the additives market for oil
              and gas exploration.
