In August, 1997, the Department of Geology acquired a
              number of valuable pieces of experimental equipment from Stanford University. 
              Equipment includes:  1) A high-capacity 1.4 GPa Harwood two-stage gas
              compressor and smaller third stage "vernier" pump.  2) Two 5 cm bore internally
              heated pressure vessels and a smaller 4.1 cm bore vessel, all with a design
              pressure of 1 GPa.  3) A large collection of valves gauges and tubing. 
              Building on funds already provided by the University of Washington, the
              investigators will assemble this equipment into a working state-of the-art
              high-pressure high-temperature experimental facility.  This facility will be
              used for experimental exploration of geological problems under conditions
              ranging from ambient to 1 GPa (10,000 bars) pressure and temperatures up to
              1,500 degrees centigrade under controlled or monitored fugacities of hydrogen,
              oxygen and sulfur.  This PT range is not accurately accessible by any other
              commonly used experimental method.  This facility will be capable of exploring
              conditions found over most of Earth's continental crust and down to upper
              oceanic mantle.  This pressure and temperature range also includes the probable
              source region for Martian shergottites (Ghosal et al., 1998).  The large volume
              of this experimental apparatus and the ability to incorporate numerous
              electrical feedthroughs into the high pressure environment allows tremendous
              flexibility in experimental design.  Furthermore, because the pressure medium
              is a gas, pressures can be measured accurately, and one can be assured that the
              pressure experienced by the sample is entirely isotropic.  Ultrasonic
              experiments are proposed that can only be done in this type of device.
