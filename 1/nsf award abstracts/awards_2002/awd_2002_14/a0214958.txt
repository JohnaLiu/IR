Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project is aimed
              towards the development of comprehensive engineering equipment capable of
              measuring droplet sizes, velocities and temperature simultaneously in a
              manufacturing environment.  The innovation of the project is multifold, as the
              proposed equipment will be capable of measuring diameter sizes, velocities, and
              temperatures simultaneously using a novel concept referred as Laser Induced
              Fluorescence Thermometry (LIFT). Under LIFT molecules are excited in the
              electronic levels by a light source emitting a secondary emission (excited
              state) that is sensitive to temperature. 
     The commercial application will
              initially be in the powder production industry and the ink-jet industry. These
              industries require the full characterization of in-flight droplets.
