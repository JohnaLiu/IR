Abstract    :
              Two well-established theories, both developed some fifty years ago, explain why
              organisms age. However, these models omit ecological and behavioral forces that
              could influence the evolution of aging. Using mathematical models and computer
              simulations, this project will develop new models of aging that include
              ecological and behavior forces. The ultimate goal is to understand currently
              unexplained aging phenomena, such as why females typically outlive males in
              most mammals or why some species escape the aging process, and to help predict
              what sorts of genes should be associated with aging.
When complete, these
              models should give us a much broader understanding of why and how aging occurs
              in humans and other species, and aid the search for genes that influence aging.
              In addition to the basic scientific advances that will result from this
              project, this work will also increase the quality of math science education.
              This project facilitates a collaboration between the principal investigator-a
              laboratory researcher who works on aging--and three mathematically-oriented
              theoreticians. As such, it will greatly enhance opportunities for mathematical
              training not only for the PI, but also for graduate students and undergraduates
              at the PI's home institution.
