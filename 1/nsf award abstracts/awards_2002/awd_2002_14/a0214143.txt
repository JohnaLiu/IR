Abstract    :
              This study will employ a national survey to explore the implications of the
              September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks for civil liberties. Previous NSF support,
              in the form of a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER), enabled the
              researchers to examine some short-term implications of the terrorist attacks on
              public anxiety, support for civil liberties, political tolerance, patriotism,
              and perceptions of the root causes of terrorism. With the first-wave data
              collection nearly complete and the results contributing to our understanding of
              political tolerance and the support for civil liberties, the researchers will
              examine the durability of civil liberties concessions over time. They will
              conduct a second wave of the "Civil Liberties Trade-Offs" survey, consisting
              of: (1) reinterviews of the initial 1400 first-wave respondents, which included
              African American and Hispanic over-samples, and (2) a survey of new respondents
              to assess testing effects.
