Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a new
              method for fabricating lensed fibers used in optical interconnects. An inkjet
              printing technique will be used to print optical polymers onto the tips of
              optical fibers, directly or via collets, to form microlenses.  The output beam
              characteristics of these monolithic devices will be collimated or focused,
              depending on the specific designs. 
     The low material/part cost and the
              self-aligning feature will result in lower cost than current
              collimation/focusing methods that use ball lens and GRIN lens assemblies.  The
              performance will be similar.   Inkjet printing is precise, data-driven, and
              direct-write.  This technique will be suitable for low cost/high volume
              production.
