Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project concerns the
              development of an electrochemical-based array nondestructive testing and
              evaluation (NDE) system for the detection of corrosion at the microscale level.
              Formation of small flaws of a destructive nature results during corrosion of a
              number of engineering metals and alloys used in transportation,
              microelectronics, electrical power production, and hazardous waste containment.
              The stability of these materials is determined by the extent to which a high
              integrity passive oxide film forms and is retained during continuous exposure
              to the ambient environment. Localized corrosion due to breakdown in these oxide
              films is responsible for limiting the lifetime of components made from these
              materials. The key to avoid flaw formation in engineering metals and alloys is
              the detection of early stages of corrosion. The proposed technology will
              provide spatially resolved information on the corrosion process at the
              microscale level as well as information on corrosion rates. The fabrication and
              test of a lab-scale electrochemical array-based corrosion sensor will be
              carried out during the Phase I project.

There are large potential commercial
              applications for this technology in various industries, such as aerospace
              (defense and commercial), marine and automotive industries, electric utility
              plants, chemical processing plants, refineries, microelectronics, electrical
              power production, and hazardous waste containment.
