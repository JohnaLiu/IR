This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              proposes to examine Multi Photon Detection (MPD) of biological warfare agents
              using a panel of MPD enhanced immunoassays. MPD based techniques promise to
              deliver: (1) parallel detection of all biological warfare agents, (2) improved
              sensitivity of biotoxin detection, leading to fewer false positives and
              negatives, (3) more rapid results, (4) lower cost per assay, and (5) greater
              ease of use. This Phase I project has the following specific objectives : (1)
              production of recombinant fragments of biotoxins and development of antibodies,
              (2) development and characterization of antibodies for biotoxins, including
              botulism, tetanus and anthrax, (3) development of IA/MPD (MPD enhanced
              immunoassay) for these three biotoxins and comparison of sensitivity with the
              prior art, mainly ELISA, and (4) further assay optimization.

The commercial
              application of this project is in the area of homeland security.
