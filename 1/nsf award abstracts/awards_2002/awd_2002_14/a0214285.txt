Abstract    :
              This project seeks to use fossil wetland deposits and fossil rodent middens from
              the Atacama Dessert in the Central Andes as a means to estimate precipitation
              and seasonality for the region as a aid to reconstructing Quaternary climate. 
              The fossil data and paleoclimatic reconstructions will be guided, in part, by
              consideration of the modalities of the modern climate.

The goal of the
              research is to use the fossil data to understand the steep transition between
              two seasonal rainfall regimes linked to the South American Summer Monsoon and
              the southern westerlies.  The chosen research sites underlie this transition
              zone and are along a 300-km stretch of Atacama Desert highlands and the
              southern edge of the Altiplano.

Broadly speaking, the research will support
              international scientific collaboration and undergraduate student training.  It
              has the potential to link important paleoclimate proxy records with modern
              climatology in order to interpret past climate processes in a region with
              little existing paleoclimate data.
