This Small Business Innovation Research  Phase I
              projectproposes to develop a novel technology for Laser-Enabled Analysis and
              Processing (LEAP ) of living cells. The ability to load cells with compounds is
              critical in many areas of research and medicine such as drug discovery and gene
              therapy. Current
methods have limitations with respect to specificity,
              efficiency, toxicity, and/or throughput. Optoinjection is a novel and versatile
              procedure for cell loading that has been demonstrated in a few laboratories.
              Unfortunately, it is a slow and laborious procedure carried out on specialized
              microscopes. Oncosis is developing a LEAP platform for high-speed cell scanning
              and purification via lethal laser effects on unwanted cells. The LEAP platform
              could be used to implement optoinjection in a high-throughput, cell-specific
              manner that would enable the commercialization of this novel form of cell
              loading. In this Phase I Project, feasibility studies are proposed to modify a
              LEAP instrument, and then to evaluate conditions of
optoinjection for
              different cells and compounds. Phase I Research will yield a
              model/database
providing greater understanding of optoinjection, and will
              define the scope of feasibility. Phase II Research will optimize and implement
              optoinjection in biologically relevant experimental systems, resulting in data
              supporting this powerful new tool for the analysis and manipulation of living
              cells within a physiological environment.

The commercial applications of
              this project will be in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.
