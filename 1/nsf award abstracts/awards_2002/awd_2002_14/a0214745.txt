Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
              manufacturing of very-large-area flexible displays. It is critical to develop a
              low-cost manufacturing process that enables very-large-area flexible displays
              to be manufactured for the military as well as the consumer. Recent technical
              innovations in the area of very-large-area lithography and fluidic
              self-assembly offer a unique process for low-cost high-volume flexible display
              manufacturing. Anvik Corporation has developed a breakthrough lithography
              technology that enables high-throughput, cost-effective production of very
              large displays (20 to 120 inches diagonal) on flexible substrates, which may be
              either loaded as discrete sheets or fed continuously in a roll-to-roll
              configuration. Anvil's very-large-area lithography technology represents a
              significant breakthrough in display manufacturing. In this proposal, we present
              a program for developing a production-worthy lithography system for
              high-throughput, low-cost fabrication of flexible, high-resolution displays of
              sizes up to 60-inch diagonal.

This lithography process are that it is
              compatible with fluidic self-assembly manufacturing techniques will potentially
              result in higher performance and lower cost displays.
