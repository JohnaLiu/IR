Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore a
              fundamentally different approach to digital magnetic sensors.  The traditional
              approach combines a sensor having an analog output with an electronic
              analog-to-digital converter.  In the proposed magnetic field sensor, the
              analog-to-digital conversion occurs in the physical mechanism of the sensor
              itself. With this approach only inexpensive digital electronic circuits are
              needed to complete the sensor system, resulting in a robust, and economically
              manufacturable design.

Being based on standard integrated circuit processing
              techniques, the new digital magnetometer will be easily mass-produced.  The new
              products will be smaller, cheaper and use less power than existing sensors in a
              range of applications including: digital compasses, geomaganetic surveying
              equipment, and vehicle sensors for traffic control and intrusion detection. The
              very small size of the sensor will also enable new applications using
              high-density sensor arrays for example in currency and document validation or
              portable biomedical assay devices.
