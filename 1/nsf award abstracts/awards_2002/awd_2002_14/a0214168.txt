Abstract    :
              	This project develops a world-level, longitudinal measure of global
              organizations and discourse devoted to human rights.  Time series analyses of
              the expected growth in this measure focus on international conflicts and the
              rise of international organizations as principal causes.  Another series of
              analyses would focus on the consequences of the rise of this global human
              rights regime for the policies and for the actual practices of individual
              nations.  While national-level factors such as economic development also affect
              national human rights policies and practices, the growth of the global human
              rights regime and a nation's connections with the global system are also major
              explanations for nation-level changes in human rights.
