Abstract    :
              Under the direction of Dr. Reiko Mazuka, Ms. Youngon Choi will collect data for
              her doctoral dissertation. Her research on language development will involve
              5-10 year-old Korean children.  Previous research suggests that, unlike adults,
              young children do not use prosodic information to disambiguate syntactically
              ambiguous sentences (such as "Tap the frog with the flower"). Ms. Choi asks
              whether children can use prosodic cues to resolve syntactic ambiguity when the
              cognitive demands of the task are not too great. Children will be asked to
              listen to a sentence and judge whether it matches with a picture. In the first
              study, prosodic cues will be presented along with other cues (such as
              morphological cues) to test whether children are better able to use prosodic
              cues when they are combined with other cues. In the second study, ambiguous
              noun phrases (rather than full sentences) will be used to test if syntactically
              less complex structures allow children to use prosodic cues more easily.
              

This research is significant to the fields of language acquisition and
              language comprehension. In particular, since little is known about the
              interaction between prosody and syntax in young children's sentence processing,
              this research will contribute to our understanding of how children develop
              language processing strategies. As most of the existing research has emphasized
              English, the use of Korean will also provide an important contrast for future
              studies.
