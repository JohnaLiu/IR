Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Neil Berthier will conduct three
              years of research to examine how infants develop a capacity for dexterous
              manual reaching.  How experience improves dexterity is of particular interest. 
              
Adults possess a remarkable capacity to use their hands to manipulate objects
              in the world.  Almost no other animals exhibit such dexterity.  Remarkably,
              manual dexterity involves the coordination of a vast number of muscles of the
              trunk, arm, and hand-a control problem that is well beyond what we can do with
              control artificial devices such as robot arms.  Dexterity does not appear
              fully-formed in adults, however, it requires a protracted period of development
              that starts soon after birth.  
The funded project uses mathematical models of
              neural and muscular systems to describe how one generates arm movements. 
              Behavioral experiments will test the model's predictions against the actual
              abilities of human infants.  Other behavioral experiments will focus on the
              role of attentive vision for control of reaching.  
This research will lead to
              a better understanding of how reaching and manual dexterity develop, and may
              also shed light on more general processes of human development.  Furthermore,
              the models used are closely related to current schemes for control of reaching
              by robots.  Thus the funded research may suggest novel approaches to the
              problem of robot control.
