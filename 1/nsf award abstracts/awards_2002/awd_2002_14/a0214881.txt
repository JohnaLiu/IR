Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
              develop a new intraoperative imaging probe based on a solid-state, compact
              readout sensor coupled to a high resolution, high light output converter.
              Nuclear Medicine imaging has been widely used to preoperatively image
              structures of interest for excisional biopsy. Radio-guided intraoperative
              procedures utilizing non-imaging gamma detector probes and radiotracers have
              facilitated a cost-effective, highly specific means to locate suspect tissue
              and access it for pathologic analysis. The result of radio-guided surgery is
              increased tissue specificity obtained for biopsy, minimally accessed incisions,
              and the reduction of inpatient hospital utilization with an improved patient
              recovery. The main drawback of non- imaging gamma guidance is the lack of
              ancillary information of the surveyed area, such as distinction between two
              neighboring radioactive regions, which can be overcome with an intraoperative
              imaging probe. Also, the highly penetrating gamma radiation from other parts of
              the body increases the background, and limits the practical use of current
              probes. This Phase i project seeks to address these limitations by designing a
              new-generation intraoperative probe intended to image the tumor bed with
              short-range beta rays. When developed, this detector will allow accurate
              delineation of the tumor, thus facilitating precise resection.

The
              commercial application of this project is in the area of biomedical devices and
              instrumentation.
