This Americas Program award will support a workshop on
              Asomycota (Fungi) to be held before the IV Congreso Latinoamericano de
              Micologia at the Universidad Veracruzana,  in Xalapa, Mexico.  The workshop,
              which is being organized by Dr. Meredith Blackwell of Louisiana State
              University in Baton Rouge, and Dr. Rosario Mendel Ortiz of the Instituto de
              Ecologia, in Xalapa, Mexico aims to train thirty U.S. and Latin American
              students in culture, identification, and systematics techniques for
              ascomycetes, a group of fungi that numbers over 32,000 species.

Throughout
              the world, about 32,000 species of ascomycetes have been described.  It is,
              however, estimated that the number could in reality be double that number and
              many of the anticipated new species are believed to occupy Neotropical
              habitats.  Indeed, mycologists who work in the region have discovered well over
              100 undescribed ascomycetes in the past year alone. It is important, therefore,
              to have a new generation of well-trained mycologists from both the U .S. and
              Latin America to work with these ecologically important organisms and
              contribute to biodiversity assessment and monitoring. The proposed workshop,
              with its focus on the latest techniques, training, and students, will promote
              an exchange of ideas, knowledge, and cooperative interactions among an upcoming
              generation of Western Hemisphere mycologists.
