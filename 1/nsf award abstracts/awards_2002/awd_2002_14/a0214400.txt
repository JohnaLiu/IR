Abstract    :
              This award support the model simulations of middle Pliocene climate using
              paleoclimatic data derived from the time period.  The researcher will use
              Pliocene age terrestrial and marine data from the Pliocene Research,
              Interpretation, and Synoptic Mapping (PRISM) project as input to a coupled
              ocean-atmosphere General Circulation Model (GCM).  

The rationale for the
              research is that the middle Pliocene was a time when the Earth experienced
              global temperatures that are comparable to recent projections of future climate
              due to increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. 
              Specifically, high latitude warming (relative to the present) and a reduced
              equator-to-pole temperature gradient dominated the middle Pliocene.

The
              broader impacts of this proposed research center on addressing a critical
              question regarding greenhouse gases (GHG) concentrations and ocean
              temperatures.  There is a desire on the part of the scientific community to
              determine if there are any oceanic 'surprises' in terms of heat transport or
              ocean circulation that track the increasing concentrations of GHG in the
              atmosphere.  Using data from a period of greater warmth on Earth, in which
              geophysical boundary conditions are similar to the modern world, this proposed
              research may help identify if there are any 'surprises' in basic function of
              the heat carrying or circulatory properties of the ocean.  When completed, the
              data generated by this research will be made available to the wider scientific
              community through publicly accessible databases.
