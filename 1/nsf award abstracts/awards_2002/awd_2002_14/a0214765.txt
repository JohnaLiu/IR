Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the processes controlling mercury (Hg) fluxes
              between the atmosphere and soils and vegetation.  Plant exposure chambers will
              be used to develop data for modeling the role of forest stand interactions with
              atmospheric Hg in the biogeochemical cycle of Hg.  Mesocosm studies will be
              used to study soil flux on multiple scales.  This effort is important for
              understanding the role of plants in the biogeochemical exchange of Hg between
              the atmosphere and terrestrial systems.
