Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to
              create state-of-the-art proximity correction software, which will ultimately be
              merged with the Nanometer Pattern Generation System, which is an advanced SEM
              lithography system that is already commercially successful. In recent years,
              SEM lithography has become an increasingly popular tool in university and
              government research labs, as well as at industrial R&D labs. The interest in
              SEM lithography comes from both its low cost and versatile nature when compared
              to the dedicated e-beam writing systems that are designed primarily for writing
              full wafers in industrial settings. The purpose of this project is to create an
              advanced proximity correction system that matches the inherent versatility of a
              well-designed SEM lithography system such as NPGS. To achieve this goal, this
              project will investigate the development of two advanced proximity correction
              techniques that are currently not commercially available. Specifically, the
              techniques are "grayscale" proximity corrections for manufacturing multi-level
              (grayscale) structures and binary proximity corrections for non-rectangular
              pattern elements.

Potential commercial applications, if successful, will
              give researchers worldwide a much more advanced e-beam lithography capability
              than is presently available.
