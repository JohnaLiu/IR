Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              novel flexible, transparent and photocurable nanocomposite barrier coatings to
              prevent the degradation of conducting polymers by oxygen and water vapor.
              Conducting polymer electronic devices can be made rapidly, low-cost, flexible,
              lightweight and mechanically more robust than inorganic electronics; the main
              limitation to their wide-scale commercialization is the problem with
              degradation. The solution to this problem is to use a barrier layer to prevent
              oxygen and water vapor from reaching the conducting polymer. Current barrier
              coatings do not block oxygen and water permeation well enough to make long
              lifetime conducting polymer devices possible, and the need is especially great
              for flexible products such as roll-up displays. Nanocomposites, polymeric
              materials that contain inorganic particles smaller than 100 nm, have
              exceptional barrier properties and are ideally suited for display applications
              because the small size of the nanoparticles allows the composite to be
              transparent. This project will utilize nanoparticles in a photocurable
              urethane-acrylate coating system to prevent oxygen and water vapor from
              reaching the underlying conducting polymer.

Coatings are needed to extend
              the lifetime of conducting polymer electronic devices including: flexible OLED
              (organic light emitting diode) displays, thin film transistors, new rapid scan
              chips used as bar-code replacements, printed electronic circuits and
              lightweight electronics.
