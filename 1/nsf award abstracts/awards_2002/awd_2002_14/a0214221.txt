Abstract    :
              This study will use multiproxy study of cores from the Soledad Basin off Baja CA
              to determine if bottom water oxygen changes over the last 10,000 years are
              caused primarily by productivity changes in surface waters or changes in
              ventilation of subsurface waters.   Proxies to be measured include planktic
              foraminifer assemblages, oxygen isotope ratio of Globigerina bulloides and N.
              pachyderma, sediment Mo abundance, and Mg/Ca in benthic foraminifers. 
              Chronology will be provided by AMS 14C and 210Pb.  Sample resolution for most
              proxies will be 100 years.  Mo measurements and sea surface temperature
              estimates will be done at  multidecadal sampling resolution.
