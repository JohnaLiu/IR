Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase 1 Project proposes
              to develop transgenic maize (Zea mays L.) with increased tolerance to heat
              stress. It has recently discovered that a gene encoding the maize chloroplast
              protein synthesis elongation factor, EF-Tu, plays a role in the development of
              heat tolerance. EF-Tu protects other proteins from heat-induced inactivation
              and aggregation. The overall goal of this project  is to genetically engineer
              maize that overproduces EF-Tu under high temperature conditions and to exploit
              the protective role that EF-Tu plays in heat tolerance. The key  objectives of
              the  Phase 1 research include (a) the creation of EF-Tu transgenic maize
              protoplasts, Arabidopsis and maize whole-plants and (b) the assessment of their
              heat tolerance in the laboratory. The results of the Phase 1 project will lay
              the groundwork for the follow-on Phase 2  and Phase 3 projects. They will
              include the testing the performance of EF-Tu transgenic maize in the field
              (Phase 2) and its commercialization (Phase 3). 

The commercial applications
              of this project will be in the area of agriculture. High-temperature is a major
              limiting factor to plant productivity, often causing significant economic
              losses to both domestic and international agricultural markets. The development
              and commercialization of transgenic maize with greater ability to tolerate heat
              stress is expected to have  enormous economic benefits for the United States
              and the world.
