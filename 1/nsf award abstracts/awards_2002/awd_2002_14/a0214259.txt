This grant provides partial support for an upgrade of the
              high-performance computing environment for geophysicists at Saint Louis
              University. Research carried out by the group is wide-ranging and includes
              Earth structure studies, seismic source studies, seismic hazard analysis,
              application of space-based remote sensing data to tectonic problems, and
              development of freely distributed software. The grant will especially benefit
              three recently hired assistant professors (Koper, Kusky and Zhu) in
              establishing research programs.
