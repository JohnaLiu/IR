Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes a highly
              innovative technique for using nanomaterials of high strength in fabrication of
              microgears with end applications in medical instrumentation. The demand for
              precision instruments required for medical diagnosis and microsurgical tools
              are increasing continuously over the past decade to provide better service.
              Endoscopes and microsurgical instruments have decreased in size from 25 mm to
              10 mm over the past six years. The decrease in size of these instruments has
              become possible due to the reduction in size of the drive systems employed.
              Electric motor drives currently in use have evolved from a size of 10 mm to 2
              mm. The tiny gears used in these motors for torque transmission fail due to
              friction and wear. Thus, there is a need for increased performance of the
              microgear components in the micromotors. The mechanical properties of strength
              and hardness are increased by fabrication of these microscale components using
              nanocrystalline particles. This Phase I Project proposes a novel approach for
              fabrication of the microgears with nanocrystalline copper. The feasibility of
              the technique will be evaluated by fabrication of microgears (100 microns
              diameter) and by the  characterization of their physical and mechanical
              properties.

The commercial applications of this project will primarily be 
              in the area of biomedical devices and instrumentation. Other applications would
               include  disk drives, toxic-gas monitors, camera-lens drives and pagers.
