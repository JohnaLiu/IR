Abstract    :
              This research seeks to understand whether large markets (i.e., markets
              consisting of many buyers and many sellers) can effectively aggregate the
              disparate pieces of information that each individual acting in the market
              possesses. It is often said that prices "convey" information. How, exactly, is
              this achieved? Under what conditions is it achieved? Stock markets are a prime
              example of markets in which information plays a crucial role. When information
              is freely available to all, it is well understood that markets operate
              efficiently. But in reality each investor possesses a small amount of
              information, which, on its own, might convey little about the value of the
              stock in question. However, if the information possessed by all traders could
              somehow be pooled, it would serve as a much better forecaster of the value of
              the stock. 

We seek to understand whether market prices alone are capable of
              conveying the information possessed by individual traders. When this occurs,
              the market achieves a high level of efficiency. When this fails to occur, one
              can begin to explore ways in which the market's design might be responsible for
              the failure. Corrective measures might then be called for.
