Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
              develop a programmable motionless optical attenuator that over performs
              commercial electro-mechanical attenuators and state-of-the-art MEMs attenuator.
              Made from a revolutionary liquid crystal and polymer composite material, i.e.,
              polymer stabilized liquid crystal material, the new technology ultimately
              promises to achieve the following performance specifications, (a) over 10,000:1
              contrast ratio, (b) less than 5 ms response time, and (c) less than 2dB
              insertion loss. In Phase I, the demo device will be constructed to show the
              technological feasibility. The Phase II effort is to develop the prototype
              attenuator that meets all the projected performance specifications followed by
              a full commercialization in the later phase.

The technology, once
              successfully developed, will be used in liquid crystal display, photonics
              instrument, telecommunication, and military systems
