Abstract    :
              The Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan
will purchase
              computing equipment which will be dedicated
to the support of research in the
              mathematical sciences.
The equipment will be used for computational
              and
visualization aspects of the research in the following
projects: 1)
              Functional Data Analysis for Modeling Human
Motion; 2) Spatial Modeling with
              Applications to Integrated
Circuit Fabrication and Reconstruction of Color
              Images;
3) Bioinformatics; 4) Inference in Dynamic Treatment
Regimes; and 5)
              Design of Experiments. The high-speed
equipment will consist of a 16-node
              Linux cluster connected
with a high-throughput Ethernet switch and two
              high-end
workstations with advanced graphics capabilities.
