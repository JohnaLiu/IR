Abstract    :
              Everyday human action is strikingly complex.  In the course of accomplishing our
              everyday goals and intentions, we move rapidly about the world contacting an
              enormous array of diverse objects for different purposes, with few pauses to
              demarcate where one action ends and the next begins.  Despite such complexity,
              when we observe others in action, we readily process the complex motion stream
              with little conscious effort.  As yet, much remains mysterious about the
              cognitive mechanisms that enable such skilled processing of dynamic human
              action.  One intriguing developmental question is how infants even make a start
              at identifying distinct acts within the continuous motion stream.  This
              research will pursue two primary goals.  The first is to investigate whether
              infants possess skills for identifying individual actions within the continuous
              motion stream, and the second is to discover how they might do so.  The
              research will advance knowledge on several fronts.  For one, the research will
              provide new information about basic action-processing skills that are
              fundamental to children's social and cognitive development.  As well, the
              research will lead to the development of new methods that may ultimately assist
              in understanding and detecting deficits in action processing; for example, such
              deficits may be a factor in autism and certain forms of brain damage acquired
              later in life.  Improved understanding of the nature of such deficits may make
              it possible to design more effective interventions for such individuals, hence
              improving social and cognitive outcomes.
