This grant supports the acquisition of eight global
              positioning system (GPS) receivers for active tectonic research in the central
              Andes of South America.  Four of the proposed receivers will be permanently
              deployed in continuous mode operation (CGPS) while the other four will be used
              in campaign or survey mode (SGPS).  The receivers will augment and/or act as
              replacements for aging receivers used by the University of Hawaii Geodesy group
              (hereafter named the Pacific Geoscience Facility - PGF) for the on-going
              collection of GPS data surrounding the active fore arc region of the central
              Andes.  The Central Andes Project (CAP) has been funded by NSF/EAR since 1992
              (EAR-9115576).   

Temporal and spatial densification of GPS measurements in
              this region will contribute to a better understanding of two fundamental
              questions in geophysics including: 1) what is the contribution of viscoelastic
              relaxation to crustal deformation following a great subduction zone
              earthquake?, and 2) what is the viscosity of the mantle?  A densification of
              CGPS measurements surrounding the epicenter of the 1960 Chilean earthquake will
              help to resolve the former question while CGPS vertical positioning in Chilean
              Patagonia will further constrain the rate of post-glacial rebound which can
              then be used to calculate lower crustal and mantle viscosity.  An understanding
              of the long term seismic cycle following a great subduction zone earthquake has
              significant implications for mitigating seismic hazards for population centers
              along the Andean Cordillera.  These receivers will also support collaborations
              between the PGF and Chilean and Argentinean geoscientists.  In-country
              scientists will collect campaign GPS data at frequencies that are logistically
              unrealistic for the PGF group, improving the output of the CAPS project for a
              marginal cost to the NSF.
