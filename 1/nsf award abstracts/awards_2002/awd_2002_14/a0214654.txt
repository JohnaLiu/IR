Abstract    :
              A gas chromatograph with a mass-selective detector (GC/MSFD) is acquired in
              order to improve the chemical analysis capability in the combustion and fuels
              research group.  The equipment will be used to support development of models of
              fundamental processes controlling hydrocarbon combustion, and  explore new
              engine designs to improve efficiency and reduce emissions.
