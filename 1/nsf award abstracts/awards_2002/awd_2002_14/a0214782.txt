This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project
              proposes to develop an optical tomography imaging system for in vivo small
              animal imaging. This  system will support both active exogenous imaging of
              oxy/deoxy-hemoglobin using near-infrared laser sources and endogenous light
              sources from bio-luminescent or fluorescent probes .With the goal of developing
               a state-of-the-art small animal scanner, this Phase I project will investigate
              source/detector configurations to determine the optimum geometry to maximize
              image resolution and to minimize cost. This will be followed by the development
              of novel image reconstruction algorithms and of innovative methods to achieve
              quantitative imaging for bioluminescent and fluorescent optical probes.

The
              commercial application of this project is in the area of animal imaging. Animal
              imaging methods are important in the evaluation of new drugs and in basic
              biomedical research.
