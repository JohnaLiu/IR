Digital Government:
               Proposal for a Workshop to Develop a Research Agenda on Digital Archiving and
              Preservation

Archiving of digital records in the Federal government is
              rapidly outstripping the need for archiving of physical objects - for example,
              it is expected that in the next year or so, the National Archive and Records
              Administration (NARA) must be prepared to accept, index, and make searchable
              over 20 million Federal emails.

Few agencies are thinking beyond the next
              2-3 years, though many, such as NARA, will be required to maintain electronic
              records in perpetuity.  Many issues arise, such as the natural 3-5 year
              obsolescence cycle of computintg systems, and the perhaps longer cycle of
              operating systems and applications and associated file formats.  Research in
              this area is clearly needed - the question is one of identifying topic areas in
              detail, and assigning some priority.  That is what this workshop is intended to
              accomplish.  Several other agencies will actively participate in this workshop:
              the National Library of Medicine, the Library of Congress and the National
              Agricultural Library.
