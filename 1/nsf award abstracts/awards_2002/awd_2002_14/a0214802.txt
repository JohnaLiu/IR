Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project describes the
              development of a high sensitivity, large dynamic range force transducer capable
              of measuring transient force changes in tension and compression. The operating
              principal is based on the change in optical properties at the molecular level
              with loading of a pre-stressed polymer material. The polymer acts as a linkage
              to which a force would be applied either in compression or tension. The
              molecular deformation of the polymer linkage will be analyzed using miniature
              optical components arranged as a phase-modulated polarimeter capable of
              birefringence measurements on the order of 10^-9.  Calibration of the measured
              birefringence with known loads will provide the necessary calibration
              parameters. 

Potential commercial instrument would be capable of directional
              force, pressure and acceleration measurements and would be extremely accurate
              for measuring low-level forces. Since the force transducer is based on optical
              techniques, it would be immune to electronic noise, and would allow measurement
              of rapidly changing loads.
