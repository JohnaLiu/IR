Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
              develop formulations of natural fatty and organic acids as alternatives to
              traditional fungicides for the control of  diseases in fruits such as grapes,
              blueberries, strawberries and raspberries. In the course of this project, the
              efficacy of these formulations as pre-harvest and post-harvest treatments for
              disease control in a number of fruits will be determined. Replicated trials
              will be conducted in the laboratory and on commercial and university farms. The
              follow on Phase II project will incorporate  more extensive field testing to
              determine efficacy against a wider range of pathogens under various climatic
              conditions.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of
              agriculture.
