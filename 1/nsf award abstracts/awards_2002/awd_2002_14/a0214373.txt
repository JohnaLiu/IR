Abstract    :
              Our understanding of eyewitness identification has increased considerably in the
              last 20 years.  There is now a long list of empirical results that have been
              shown to be both reliable and illuminating with respect to the underlying
              psychological mechanisms.  This research builds upon this foundation to develop
              a unified theory of the memory and decision processes that witnesses use when
              they are presented with a lineup and must make an identification decision,
              including the decision to not make an identification.  This research will use a
              computer simulation program, Witness, where the model's fundamental assumptions
              are formalized mathematically.  This model will be used to motivate and
              interpret the results of several experiments that are designed to address the
              fundamental question: How do witnesses make identification decisions?  The
              experiments specifically test the decision rule presently incorporated in the
              model.  The model will be fit to data from experiments that carefully covary
              suspect and foil similarity; examine the relationship between suspect-matched
              and description-matched lineups; compare showups to sequential and simultaneous
              lineups; and examine how more specific witness instructions affect
              identification.
