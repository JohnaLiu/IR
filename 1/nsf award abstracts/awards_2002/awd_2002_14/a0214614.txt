Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will synthesize
              will demonstrate that a hybrid system combining the attributes of Jet Vapor
              Deposition and Rotating Disk Reactors solves existing Silicon Carbide film
              deposition problems and can be developed to create a superior film production
              tool. The high speed "jet" convectively transports precursors directly to the
              surface, overcoming diffusion-limited transport rates, and largely avoiding
              unwanted pre-reactions in the gas phase; the rotation allows the "jets"to
              uniformly "paint" the surface with precursor. Our Phase I efforts will focus on
              proving that the hybrid tool will be a superior tool for Silicon Carbide
              epitaxy--highly desired for microelectronic devices such as high-power,
              high-temperature,
high frequency devices. 

Potential commercial
              applications of the research are expected in reliable, micro-fabrication
              process.  The successful development of Silicon Carbide film deposition would
              represent an important advancement in metal thin film deposition process.
