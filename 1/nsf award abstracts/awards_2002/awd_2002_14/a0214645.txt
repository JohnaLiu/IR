Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will fill a
              critical need for accurate location and depth measurement of undersea
              fiberoptic cables. This program will builds on prior expertise in
              ultra-sensitive magnetic susceptibility detection in the human body. The
              susceptometry technique provides the high signal-to-noise ratios, and then
              ability to suppress the background response of bottom sediments, that are
              needed for accurate depth measurements. At the same time, this program will
              require significant high-risk developments to maximize the accuracy of depth
              determination, localize fiberoptic cables 2 m or more below the sea floor, and
              adapt the measurement system to the deep ocean environment. 

This program
              has strong support from industry leaders. These experts emphasize that no
              existing cable location system provides adequate depth information, and that
              accurate cable depths are crucial to avoid damage that can cost millions of
              dollars per second. With more than 680,000 kilometers of fiberoptic cables in
              the ocean, and the cable inspection market growing at an estimated 30% per
              year, this new fiberoptic locator system has excellent commercial potential.
