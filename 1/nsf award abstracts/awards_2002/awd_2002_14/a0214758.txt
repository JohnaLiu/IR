Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop
              novel approaches for the synthesis of carcinogen-modified oligodeoxynucleotides
              (ODNs) and carcinogen deoxynucleoside monomer adducts that can be used in
              physical, chemical, conformational, and biological studies, and as reference
              standards in both academic and commercial work. These reagents are difficult to
              acquire and they are available to only a few large laboratories with sufficient
              resources to synthesize them. The proposed methodology will reduce the cost of
              synthesizing these types of materials substantially, resulting in the
              widespread availability of these important biological components on a
              cost-effective commercial scale. One of the attractive features of the proposed
              methodology is that it will be applicable not only to carcinogen-modified ODNs,
              but will also be employed for the construction of ODNs modified with other
              types of agents, such as, tethers and dyes. Tethered ODNs can be attached to
              arrays and used as targets for gene sequence analysis.

The commercial
              applications of this project  are straightforward and involve direct sales of 
              the modified ODNs and carcinogen adduct monomers to the academic community for
              fundamental research investigations  and to industrial firms for environmental
              monitoring.
