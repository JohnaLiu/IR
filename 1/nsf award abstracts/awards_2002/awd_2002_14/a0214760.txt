Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
              develop a novel Resonant-Enhanced Crystallization (REC) Process. REC technology
              is similar to conventional impeller stirring crystallization but with enhanced
              mass and heat transfer, low shear or reduced crystal breakage, and improved
              crystal size distribution. Purification and separation by crystallization is a
              multicomponent mass transfer phenomenon of the crystallizing solute and
              impurity solutes. Mass and heat transfer in crystallization process are key
              factors affecting crystal growth rate, size distribution and habit. However, in
              conventional crystallizers, the mass transfer coefficient is maximized when
              crystals are in their terminal velocity and increased agitation results in
              significant crystal breakage. The proposed technology will further increase
              mass transfer even in cases where crystals are in suspended status. Due to the
              low shear associated with the acoustic agitation, crystal breakage will be
              minimal. The second nucleation will also be reduced and therefore, crystal size
              distribution will be improved. The objective of this proposed research is to
              incorporate low-frequency acoustic agitation to the crystallization process to
              greatly enhance mass and heat transfer. This is expected  to improve crystal
              growth rate, size distribution and quality. 

The commercial applications of
              this project are in the area of pharmaceutical separation and purification.
