Abstract    :
              Summary:  The project will reconstruct Holocene millennial-scale changes in
              upper NADW properties in three cores on the Laurentian Slope that form a
              transect between 1035 and 1854m water depth.  Oxygen isotope, Mg/Ca, Cd/Ca and
              Zn/Ca measurements will be done on benthic foraminifers to characterize deep
              water properties including temperature and salinity estimates.  Chronology will
              be constrained by AMS 14C dates.  Preliminary data indicate the cores have
              accumulation rates of 20-50cm/kyr.  Sampling intervals will range from 40-60
              years.  Oxygen isotope and Mg/Ca measurements of the planktic foraminifer G.
              bulloides  in the Holocene section of a core near the mouth of the Labrador sea
              to relate the deep water changes to surface water changes.
