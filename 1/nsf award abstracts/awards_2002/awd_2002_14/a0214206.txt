This grant provides support for an upgrade of the
              computational facilities at the Center for Earthquake Research and Information
              (CERI), University of Memphis.  Equipment to be purchased will include two SUN
              multi-CPU severs, a RAID system, a tape backup system, two color printers, and
              several individual workstations.   This equipment will facilitate a multitude
              of CERI functions including, a role as an information center for state and
              local governments interested in mitigating seismic hazards surrounding the New
              Madrid Fault Zone, maintenance of a public outreach program on earthquake
              hazards, maintenance of the central and eastern U.S. seismicity database in
              collaboration with the USGS, and basic seismological and geodetic research and
              education.  Several researchers at CERI including Mitch Withers, Arch Johnston,
              Michael Ellis, Robert Smalley and Chuck Langston will employ this equipment for
              research in earthquake seismology, mantle tomography and active margin plate
              kinematics.
