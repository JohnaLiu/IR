Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop oral
              vaccines for controlling white spot syndrome virus (WSSV)in marine shrimp using
              transgenic algae. In recent years shrimp production on Latin American shrimp
              farms has been reduced by up to 50 percent by WSSV outbreaks. Current
              technologies for controlling WSSV have had limited effectiveness. This Phase I
              Project will test the hypothesis that transgenic algae expressing WSSV capsid
              proteins can function as  ideal vaccine  delivery vectors for nearly all
              life-stages of shrimp. Larval shrimp feed on microalgae and adult shrimp
              consume dried microalgae in their diet. Recent work by the investigators has
              demonstrated that both live and freeze-dried microalgae expressing foreign
              antigens can induce an antigen-specific immune response in fish. It is
              therefore likely that microalgae can deliver functional antigens via oral
              delivery.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of
              shrimp farming.
