This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project
              proposes to develop novel biomaterial-based microparticles called Sphericules.
              These microparticles are self-contained micrometer-scale reactors capable of
              performing genetic analysis without expensive instruments. The new composite
              beads, with temperature stability, solvent resistance, controlled buoyancy and
              other properties, will find applications  in many diverse markets. The
              Sphericule methodology combines layers of natural and synthetic polymers,
              metals, ceramics and other chemicals to produce new composite beads, fibers and
              coatings.  In contrast, multifunctional latex beads using a surface coating of
              antibody on a micron sized fluorescent particle are labor intensive to produce.
              Particle batch processing results in aggregation, uneven surface treatment, and
              loss of signal molecules. This Phase I project proposes a novel method for
              synthesizing uniform particles using micro-scale systems in a continuous
              process. In this process, the chemistries of bead formation, optical reagent
              incorporation and surface modifications are expected to be straightforward,
              stoichiometric and predictable. 

The commercial applications of this project
              are in the areas of biomedicalresearch, diagnostics, electronics, and defense.
