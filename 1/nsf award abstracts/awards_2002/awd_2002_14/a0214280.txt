This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project
              proposes to develop a real-time anthrax (Bacillus anthracis) detector for
              mail-sorting systems. The proposed analyzer would allow detecting, identifying
              and removing anthrax laden letters in a mail-sorting machine prior to
              distribution. The  Phase I Project will focus on improving sensitivity so that
              1000 spores can be detected in 10 seconds. The folow on Phase II Project will
              develop a prototype anthrax detector for testing in mail sorting facilities.
              Successful completion of the proposed project will result in a tool that will
              decrease the threat of widespread anthrax
infection and increase homeland
              security.

The commercial applications of this project are self evident. The
              proposed analyzer wil be of immediate use at the US Military Postal Service
              Agency, at the US postal office, at private postal services, as well as in
              large office buildings and corporations that employ their own internal mailing
              office centers. Modifications to
the system would also allow rapid detection
              of chemical agents in glass or plastic containers at ports of entry (e.g. at
              airports).
