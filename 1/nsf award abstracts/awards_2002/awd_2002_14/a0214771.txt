Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the
              exploitation of nano-materials as optical based chemical sensors. This
              innovative approach to chemical sensing will take advantage of the material's
              quantum size effects, such as enhanced absorption and photoluminescence
              properties (sensitivity), high surface areas for analyze sensing
              (miniaturization), and ease of synthetic preparation (specificity). The use of
              optical based sensors provides additional advantages, such as no electrical
              noise, fast response, ease of miniaturization, safe near flammables, more
              durable than electronics, and applications to remote sensing.  The
              characterization of the optical and electronic properties of the nanomaterials
              is critical to their development into the proposed optical sensor
              arrays.

This research will also contribute to the increasing information
              database of nanomaterials as they pertain to advanced electronic materials. 
              The research will lay the groundwork for fabricating multi-analyze optical
              sensors. The technology, once successfully developed, will be used the
              semiconductor manufacturing industry.
