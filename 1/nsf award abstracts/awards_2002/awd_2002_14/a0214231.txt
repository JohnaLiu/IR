The project is exploratory research on microbial diversity
              of Arctic sediments at two specific locations in Greenland. The effort will go
              to the field and work in the laboratory to

- Investigate molecular diversity
              of marine sediment prokaryotes. Using total DNA extracts and 16S rRNA approach
              the PIs will characterize the Archaea and Bacteria found in the sediments at
              the experimental sites.
- Examine molecular diversity of marine sediment
              Protista. They will characterize the genetic (18S rRNA and other genes)
              diversity of psychrophilic and psychrotolerant microeukaryotes at the
              experimental sites.
- Explore in detail morphological and genetic diversity of
              one specific group of marine sediment protists, ciliated Protozoa. They will be
              looking for cryptic psychrophilic species that may remain un- or misudentified
              because of their morphological similarity to their relatives from the temperate
              areas.

This exploratory project will lay the ground for the future
              large-scale research on ecology, evolution, genomics, and biotechnological
              potential of microorganisms from Arctic sediments.
