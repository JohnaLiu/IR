Abstract    :
              This award will help develop an accurate chronology of Icelandic glacier
              fluctuations in order to understand the nature and timing of climate
              variability in the North Atlantic region since the Last Glacial Maximum.  The
              investigators will apply cosmogenic 3Helium and 36Clorine surface exposure
              dating to well-reserved glacial features in Iceland.  This effort represents a
              significant effort to apply surface exposure dating to glacial deposits and
              landforms in Iceland.

The primary goal of the research effort is to
              establish a well-dated record of ice cap fluctuations during the early
              to-mid-Holocene.  Prior research by the investigators and others has shown that
              cosmogenic surface exposure dating can achieve 500 to 1,000 year resolution,
              which is sufficient to allow the use of glacial geologic records as indicators
              of climate forcing at millennial time scales.  Preliminary field and laboratory
              studies suggest that dating efforts in Iceland will yield results of similar
              resolution and have the potential to establish a terrestrial record of
              glaciation in the central North Atlantic of unprecedented resolution.

An
              improved chronology of glaciation in Iceland will provide a new perspective on
              the terrestrial consequences of abrupt North Atlantic climate change and, when
              integrated with other well-established climate proxies from marine sediment and
              ice cores, will contribute significantly to further understanding these
              environmental changes.
