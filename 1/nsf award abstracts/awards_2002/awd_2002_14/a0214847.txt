Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project  proposes to
              develop a novel, electro-optical sensor capable of capturing single airborne
              particles and analyzing their compositions on a time scale of a few minutes.
              The sensor concept is based on a previously developed innovative technology for
              single-particle electrodynamic capture and Raman spectroscopy. The
              electrodynamic trap is capable of capturing and suspending single airborne
              particles of sizes 1 to 100 m. Analysis of the trapped particle by Raman
              spectroscopy provides a fingerprint of the vibrational structures of the
              particle's chemical components, analogous to that obtained by infrared
              absorption spectroscopy, but with single-particle sensitivity. This in turn
              leads to identification of the particle as bacterial or otherwise, as well as
              to preliminary identification of the bacterial species. In this Phase I
              project,  a compact sensor that can continually screen ambient habitat air and
              analyze each trapped particle on a time scale of minutes will be
              devised.

The commercial application of this project is in defense and
              health-related industries.
