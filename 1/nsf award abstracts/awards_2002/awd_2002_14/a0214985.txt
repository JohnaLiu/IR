This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will
              develop  a new general platform for preparing biosensors for a large number of
              target molecules. The target molecules for these biosensors will be the
              compounds (ligands) which regulate DNA binding activity of sequence-specific
              DNA binding proteins. A large number of such highly-selective ligand-dependent
              DNA binding proteins has evolved in nature to regulate
gene expression. Many
              of the ligands for these proteins are compounds of interest in environmental,
              forensic, toxicological and biomedical analysis. This project proposes a
              general strategy to prepare biosensors that can detect these ligands and that
              take advantage of the outstanding specificity of DNA binding proteins. The
              presence of the target molecule will be reported by a change of fluorescence
              intensity of the sensor. The overall objective of the Phase I  project is to
              provide experimental verification of the biosensor design. 

The commercial
              applications of this project are expected to span a number of different markets
              requiring detection of many target molecules. The new biosensors to be
              developed in this project will find commercial use as detectors of
              environmental pollutants, of toxic compounds in food and of regulatory
              molecules in biological and biomedical research.
