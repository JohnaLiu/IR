Abstract    :
              This award is to support research that will determine whether tree rings in the
              tropical hardwood species Hymenaea courbaril  represent annual growth
              rings.

Field work will be undertaken to collect samples of Hymenaea
              courbaril  from localities where short instrumental records are available for
              calibration.  Isotopic analyses and and visual and computer assisted methods of
              cross dating will be used to determine the growth history of this species.

              
The broader impacts of this proposed research are that, if the growth rings
              are determined to be annual, a pan-tropic taxon will be available for
              dendrochronology and climatologic studies of tropical terrestrial environments.
