Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to study
              the feasibility of a
simple and practical narrow-bandwidth vacuum ultraviolet
              (VUV)laser light source,tunable
around 157 nm.This work will combine recent
              advances in laser technology and nonlinear-
optical techniques with
              previously-studied frequency-conversion schemes.A doubly-resonant
four-wave
              mixing in a guided-wave geometry will be used to convert UV light into the
              VUV.
Extrapolation from previously observed conversion efficiencies shows that
              the overall
conversion efficiency of this process may be increased by
              100-1000x,from ~10 -4 to near-unity
efficiency.The laser system that will be
              developed to drive this process will be small-scale and
all
              solid-state.

The commercial potential for such a device promises to
              radically-improve the practicality of VUV light sources over current laser
              systems,and will find immediate application as a tool for development of
157nm
              lithography for manufacturing of integrated circuits,and well as in a variety
              of other
basic science and technological applications.
