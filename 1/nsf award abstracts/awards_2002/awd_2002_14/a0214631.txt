Abstract    :
              Funds from this award will be used to support junior researchers to attend the
              2002 Symposium on Radiation Measurements and Applications, to be held at the
              University of Michigan, May 21-23, 2002.  This symposium will bring together
              researchers from a broad range of expertise and applications of nuclear
              physics, including areas of nuclear medicine and national security.  The
              symposium is unique in its focus area of radiation measurements.
