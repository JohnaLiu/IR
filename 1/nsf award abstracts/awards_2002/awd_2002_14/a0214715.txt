Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will integrate a
              new free-space low frequency electric field (E) sensor with a miniaturized
              magnetic induction (B) sensor
to form a compact six channel sensor package.
              The proposed new E and B sensor offers a completely new instrumentation
              capability for geosciences, providing for the first time measurement of the
              full electromagnetic field vector in a compact package without contact to the
              ground or any other physical object. The Phase I objectives are to study the
              trade-offs involved in reducing the overall sensor volume to allow airborne
              operation, and the use of multiple baseline methods for cancellation of local
              noise. The application of the new sensor to a variety of geosciences
              applications ranging from the measurement of ULF atmospheric phenomena and
              lightning characterization, to magnetotellurics from a mobile platform will be
              studied. In Phase II a full prototype will be built and tested for the most
              promising applications.

Commercial applications include general research
              instrumentation for low frequency electromagnetic fields, atmospheric
              electromagnetic phenomena, military sensors, and complete systems for potential
              new applications in lighting characterization and airborne magnetotellurics.
