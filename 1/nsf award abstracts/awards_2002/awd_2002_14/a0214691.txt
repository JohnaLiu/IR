Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is the identification and the construction of allocation
              rules enjoying properties of fairness and non-manipulability. 

Central to
              the study are the following: all agents benefit from an enlargement of
              resources held in common, more generally of opportunities open to society as a
              whole; each agent benefits from an enlargement of his endowment, or of his
              productivity; the welfare of all agents is affected in the same direction by
              changes in the environment over which no one in particular has control (they
              all gain or they all lose as a result of the change); the arrival of additional
              agents, when it is socially costly, implies a welfare loss for all agents
              initially present; the desirability of an allocation is not affected by the
              departure of some agents with their assignments; finally, if for two economies
              having a group of agents in common, two allocations are chosen at which these
              agents receive the same aggregate resource, then each of them individually
              receives the same thing in both. The strategic component of the program focuses
              on the requirement that agents should never gain by misrepresenting the
              information they control, and it includes related properties of
              implementability in the face of incomplete information.

The possible
              applications of our allocation problem are the following: dividing a resource
              as a function of claims agents have on it (equivalently, assessing tax
              liabilities as a function of individual resources agents control); allocating
              the cost of a public facility when agents' needs are nested and when the
              facility has to be built so as to accommodate the agents with the greatest need
              (exemplified by the so-called ``airport" problem); allocating the cost of a
              public facility when agents' needs overlap, such as when they are distributed
              in space (businesses along a road) or time (overlapping generations);
              allocating the cost of a network, such as a road network or an electrical
              network; allocating a service over time (sequencing and scheduling); allocating
              private goods in standard economies.
