Abstract    :
              
Light activates a series of specific photoreceptors and initiates a complex
              series of signal transduction events that result in dramatic developmental,
              physiological, and biochemical changes in the plant.  At least three classes of
              light receptors (cryptochromes, phototropins, phytochromes) are involved in
              sensing the ambient light conditions.  While phytochromes absorb in the red and
              far red regions, cryptochromes and phototropins absorb in the blue and UV-A
              regions.  Although Ca2+ has been identified as a key second messenger in many
              signaling pathways, its role in photoreceptor signaling in a single plant cell
              has not been established.  In a previous study, calcium ratio imaging using
              Fura 2 was used to measure cytoplasmic calcium in dark-growing caulonemal cells
              of the moss Physcomitrella patens.  Fortuitously, the UV-A light needed to
              quantify calcium stimulated the photoreceptor system, making this approach an
              important means to study the role that calcium plays in photoreceptor
              signaling.  P. patens mutants that are without cryptochrome genes have been
              made available to us.  Calcium signaling and side branch formation will be
              examined in these plants to determine the role of calcium as a second messenger
              in cryptochrome signal transduction.
