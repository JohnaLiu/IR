Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will develop
              plasticized poly(lactic acid) (PLA) nanocomposites. PLA is a biopolymer derived
              from corn that is stiff at room temperature, but that can be made more flexible
              by adding significant amounts of plasticizers. Plasticizers are small, often
              volatile molecules that are incorporated, but not bound, into polymers to make
              them softer. These plasticizers can migrate out of PLA, forming a sticky layer
              on the surface and leaving the plastic hard and brittle. Technology that could
              both reduce the amount of plasticizer necessary to lower the glass transition
              temperature and to prevent the plasticizer from leaching out of the polymer
              would create large new market opportunities for PLA. This Phase I project
              proposes to increase the permanence of plasticizers by incorporating
              nanoparticle-anchored plasticizers into PLA. Anchored plasticizers would not be
              volatile, and extraction and migration should be significantly lower. The
              anchored plasticizer will still affect the glassy to rubbery transition of the
              host material, and yet the permanence of the plasticizer will be substantially
              increased. 

The commercial applications of this project will be  in a number
              of consumer use markets that rely on petroleum as the starting material. They
              include flexible plastic films, bags, and toys. Flexible PLA also has the
              potential to replace commodity thermoplastics like polyolefins and PVC in
              specific applications.
