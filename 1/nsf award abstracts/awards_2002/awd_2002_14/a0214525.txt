Abstract    :
              This award is to analyze sediments from Lake Bosumtwi to generate a record of
              tropical West African hydrologic variability back to 3000 years with decadal
              resolution.  In addition, the first tropical record of atmospheric radiocarbon
              change between 10,000 and 25,000 years will be produced.

Previous field work
              has secured laminated core material back to about 25,000 years at Lake
              Bosumtwi.  A variety of proxy indicators of climate will be analyzed from these
              sediments to produce a paleohydrologic time series.  Charcoal from terrestrial
              plants will be dated from the varved layers to generate a D14C calibration
              curve for radiometric dating.  

The timing of droughts and the natural
              variability of droughts to this region (West Africa) are important.  Better
              understanding of how the hydrologic history of the region relates to similar
              records from other regions will advance our overall knowledge of the climate
              system and allow us to answer many questions regarding interrelationships
              between low and high latitude and marine and terrestrial climate interactions. 
              The true shape of the atmospheric radiocarbon variation during glacial to
              deglacial times will be an important advancement for radiocarbon dating.
