Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine
              the feasibility of developing a highly innovative, low-cost, high-speed
              opto-electronic sensor capable of continuously monitoring molten metal alloy
              compositions during casting and melting operations.  Development of this sensor
              is among the highest priority technology needs identified by both the metal
              casting industry and the aluminum industry in their industry roadmaps of the
              future.  In order to effectively compete, U.S. metal industries must increase
              their use of low cost scrap and must also find ways to increase production
              efficiency. The proposed sensor will acquire critical compositional data
              thousands of times faster than current commercial methods and will operate on a
              real time basis without the need to place the sensor in contact with the molten
              metal. At these speeds, a melt shop could produce one extra metal production
              batch (i.e. heat) per day, amounting to a 15% increase in productivity.

The
              $30 Billion aluminum smelting industry translates to a potential $4.5 Billion
              increase in production output for little or no additional capital investment
              other than the sensor system itself. Improved product quality, reduced
              emissions, energy savings, and increased product yield will result from the
              shorter melting times. Similar improvements would be possible for zinc, copper,
              brass, bronze, iron, ceramics and glass industries that also have need for a
              similar continuous sensor system to monitor composition and quality.
