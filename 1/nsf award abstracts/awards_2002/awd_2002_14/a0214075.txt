Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop  a
              miniature electrochemically operated antimicrobial agents generator for
              suppression of dental plaque and halitosis control. Plaque, oral malodor,
              gingivitis, periodontal disease, and discoloration of the teeth are all
              undesirable conditions that affect many people. It is broadly estimated that
              25-85 million Americans have halitosis, especially due to gram-negative
              anaerobic bacteria. While good oral hygiene, as achieved by brushing the teeth
              with a cleansing dentifrice, reduces the above-mentioned conditions, it does
              not necessarily prevent or eliminate their occurrence. Microorganisms
              contribute to both the initiation and progression of these conditions. Thus,
              suppressing microorganisms is the key to good oral hygiene. In this Phase I
              project, optimization of the electrocatalyst (to improve current and energy
              efficiencies as well as long term stability) and biocidal properties of the
              dual disinfectants will be conducted. In the follow on Phase II project, the
              miniature device will be constructed. This miniature mouthwash generator,
              simultaneously producing two FDA approved antimicrobial agents, has a
              significant potential for commercialization. The device is expected to be
              robust and maintenance free, and will require only  the replacement of penlight
              batteries and inexpensive consumables.

The commercial application of this
              project is in the area of dental hygiene for general household use.
