Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
              the use of a highly sensitive technology to measure the amount of trace metal
              ions presented in water or other liquid samples and the eventual development of
              portable instrumentation.  This novel approach to detection is effective,
              sensitive, selective, inexpensive, hazard-free, and truly portable. The system
              uses an innovative high-resolution bi-cell surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
              detector combined with anodic stripping voltammetry to achieve detection of
              ultra-low concentrations of trace metal ions in water.  The device based on
              this technology can be used as a laboratory instrument as well as a portable
              device for field evaluation of water quality.  Further, it could be used as a
              clinical diagnostic tool for detection of toxic metal ions in blood or saliva
              samples.

This effort will provide an accurate determination of trace metal
              ions in water.  This technology could have a significant impact for protection
              of the environment.  The ability to determine what is hazardous in the
              environment is very important.
