This Small Business Innovative Research Project proposes
              to combine a novel low-frequency acoustic energy technology with an airlift
              bioreactor. This is expected to provide a dramatic increase in bioreactor
              productivity by greatly increasing mass transport.  The proposed technology
              will meet contemporary industry needs for a high productivity, low-shear
              bioreactor that can be used to economically produce a broad range of
              traditional and newly emerging biochemicals and bioproducts.

The commercial
              applications of this project include the culturing of pharmaceuticals and other
              biochemicals  from a broad range of organisms including plant cells, mammalian
              cells, fungi, bacteria and yeast.
