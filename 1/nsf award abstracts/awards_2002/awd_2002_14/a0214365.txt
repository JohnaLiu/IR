Abstract    :
              This is a pilot study to determine whether a reliable chronology can be
              developed via alkenone dating and magnetic paleointensity for sediment cores
              from the Peru margin.  If so, then follow on studies will investigate the
              denitrification zone of the Peru margin, its possible links with productivity
              and El Nino/ La Nina cycles, and the extent to which suboxic conditions in the
              water column, leadng to denitification, are correlated with rapid climate
              change events on decadal to orbital time scales for the last 60 k years.  The
              study will utilize scores drilled on ODP Leg 112, and eventually will be a
              multiproxy study of several cores in a variety of water depths.  Most of the
              cores contain only a small carbonate fraction and some of the cores are
              laminated.  For cores containing forms, high resolution chronologies will be
              established with foram 14 C and S 18 O and for those without forams a
              combination of geomagnetic paleointensity, alkenone 14C, and optical methods
              will be used.  In this pilot study, two cores, one with limited foram
              abundances and one with no forams,  will be studied to establish
              chronologies.
