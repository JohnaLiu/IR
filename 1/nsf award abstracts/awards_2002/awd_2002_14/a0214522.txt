Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
              develop a carbon isotope ratio analyzer based on Off-Axis Integrated Cavity
              Output Spectroscopy to measure the ratio of  C13 to  C12 in exhaled breath in
              real time. The analyzer will serve as a medical diagnostic instrument that will
              operate in a point-of-care setting and reference labs. The instrument will be
              inexpensive, portable, easy-to-use and report  C13/ C12 measurements with
              sufficient sensitivity and precision to replace mass spectrometry in 
              C13-labeled breath tests for diagnosis of a number of  conditions, including
              exposure to chemical and biological warfare agents, sepsis, assessment of liver
              and pancreatic function, delayed gastric emptying, bacterial overgrowth,
              irritable bowel syndrome and viral infection.  The Phase I Project will develop
              an instrument to determine infection due to Helicobacter pylori, a Class-1
              carcinogen, using the  C13-urea breath test. The follow on Phase II Project
              will develop a prototype commercial instrument for clinical trials.

The
              commercial application of this project is in the area of medical diagnostics.
