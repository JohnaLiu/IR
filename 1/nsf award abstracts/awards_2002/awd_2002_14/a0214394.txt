Abstract    :
              This award will provide partial support of an international conference at the
              International Pacific Research Center, Honolulu, Hawaii on November 11-14, 2002
              entitled "The Hadley Circulation: Past, Present, and Future." 

The intent of
              the conference is to bring together an international group of climatologists,
              modelers, and paleoclimatologists to share the latest ideas on Hadley
              Circulation, paleoclimatic records that describe past dynamics of the Hadley
              Circulation, and ideas as to potential future changes in Hadley Circulation as
              a result of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations.  The participants will
              include seasoned researchers, new investigators, and students.  A conference
              volume synthesizing and summarizing the conference proceedings and findings
              will be published.
