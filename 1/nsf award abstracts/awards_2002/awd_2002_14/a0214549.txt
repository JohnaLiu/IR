Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Daniel Schwartz will conduct three
              years of research.  The funded project will examine how people integrate action
              and thought, particularly around the use of complex tools.  The ability to use
              multipart tools and imagine their consequences is a uniquely human ability. 
              For example, suppose you close your eyes and pull a string from a spool that,
              you believe, turns a miniature merry-go-round resting on top.  As a
              consequence, you may also better imagine the movement of objects placed on the
              merry-go-round, like the benches or horses.  Action facilitates
              imagination.
The spool example suggests two central claims: (1) timing of
              bodily action facilitates spatial imagination about the consequences of tool
              use; and, (2) knowledge of a physical situation controls how timing influences
              a spatial inference.  In the research, participants must picture themselves in
              a different location to judge the position of two objects with respect to each
              other.  This judgment is facilitated by rotating a map by hand (with eyes
              closed).  The proposed studies include various devices for turning the map at
              different rates:  People may tap a lever that turns the map a few or many
              degrees at a time; they may turn a steering wheel clockwise, to make the map
              rotate counter-clockwise; or, they may turn an imaginary map in their hands, as
              though they were holding a map, although they know that they are not.  The
              studies will clarify the significance of timing in action and the knowledge and
              beliefs that couple action and inferences about changing spatial
              relations.
Most aspects of life include tool use.  To understand how tool use
              and imagination are intertwined is to understand a fundamental aspect of human
              ability.  Because it speaks directly to imagination, this work will supply a
              partial explanation of invention-how we may imagine the potential of novel
              tools.  It also speaks to the learning, use, and transfer of knowledge about
              complex physical tools.  Likewise the imaginative component speaks to
              development and application of virtual environments in which bodily motions are
              not actually physically connected to outcomes.  Another application of this
              work would be for training in the use of tools, as in medical practice, for
              example, where a tool is not directly in view, as in orthoscopic surgery.  But,
              perhaps, the most interesting implication of this work is how the use of
              hands-on materials may teach abstract ideas to children.
