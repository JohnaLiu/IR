This Small Business Innovation Research Project proposes
              to use silicon microfabrication techniques to produce new silicon spotting pins
              that will be used for the preparation of microarrays. Microarray technology has
              rapidly spread into many diverse areas of biological research. The preparation
              of a large portion of these arrays is accomplished by direct contact printing
              using high precision metal spotting pins, which are individually machined at
              costs up to $400 each. Using straightforward silicon microfabrication
              techniques,this company has prepared prototype silicon spotting pins, holders
              and transfer devices for the preparation of microarrays whose performance
              characteristics are expected to far exceed those of current state-of-the-art
              devices. Advantages of silicon spotting pins over machined metal components
              include 10-100 fold higher dimensional tolerances, less than 1% of the weight
              (lighter pressure gives more uniform spots), tip hardness, the ability to
              chemically modify the SiO2 surface of the pins to control wetting and liquid
              uptake/release, higher pin density in array (higher spot density in
              microarray), more precise volumetric uptake into pin, lower surface friction
              (ease of sliding movement in holder), resistance of tip to bending damage and
              the ability to fabricate complex features not obtainable by traditional machine
              shop fabrication. Since the parts will be mass produced, it is estimated that 
              a hundred  to a  thousand fold reduction in cost per pin would result.

The
              commercial applications of this project are in the area of DNA microarrays.
