Abstract    :
              This project investigates whether investor behavior in stock markets is
              influenced by social interaction. One channel through which social interaction
              might influence investors is that they spread information and ideas about
              stocks to one another directly, through word-of-mouth communication. However,
              in spite of their familiarity, such hypotheses about social interaction have
              received little direct support in stock-market data. In an effort to bring
              large-sample evidence to bear on these questions, this project conducts two
              studies of social interaction and investor behavior in stock markets. 

The
              first study investigates the idea that stock-market participation by households
              is influenced by social interaction.  A simple model is built in which any
              given "social" investor finds it more attractive to invest in the market when
              the participation rate among his peers is higher. The model predicts higher
              participation rates among social investors than among "non-socials". The theory
              is tested using data from the Health and Retirement Study.  Social households
              are defined as those who interact with their neighbors, or who attend church.  
              The investigators test whether the social investors are indeed substantially
              more likely to invest in the stock market than non-social households,
              controlling for other factors like wealth, race, education and risk tolerance.
              The investigators also test an auxiliary prediction of their model that the
              impact of sociability is stronger in states where stock-market participation
              rates are higher. 

A second study investigates word-of-mouth effects on the
              holdings and trades of money managers.   The idea is a very simple one,
              premised on the assumption that fund managers who work in the same city are
              more likely to come into direct contact with one another, and hence to exchange
              ideas by word-of-mouth. Consider for example a fund manager working for the
              Fidelity fund family, which is located in Boston, and her decision of whether
              or not to buy, say, shares of Intel in a given quarter. Our basic prediction is
              that this decision will be more heavily influenced by the decisions of fund
              managers working for the Putnam family, which is also located in Boston, than
              by the decisions of fund managers located in other cities.   Using a large
              database of mutual fund holdings, the investigators look to see whether a
              mutual-fund manager is more likely to hold (or buy, or sell) a particular stock
              in any quarter if other managers from different fund families located in the
              same city are holding (or buying, or selling) that same stock. In these
              regressions, we are able to control for the distance between the fund manager
              and the stock in question and for heterogeneity in investment styles.  
              Finally, in a model in which investors spread information and ideas about
              stocks directly to one another by word of mouth, it takes time for ideas about
              stocks to travel over large distances, much as with a contagious disease. The
              investigators can test for such trading dynamics by checking whether a given
              fund manager's trades responds to the trades of other fund managers with more
              of a lag when these other managers are located in more distant cities.
