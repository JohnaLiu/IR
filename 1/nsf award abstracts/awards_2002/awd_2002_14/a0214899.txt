Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop 
              temperature-sensitive nanoparticles to protect drugs from degradation in a
              targeted drug delivery system. Several important pharmaceutical compounds have
              low solubility and short half-life in the aqueous phase. As a result,
              significant portions of the therapeutic agents hydrolyze during formulation or
              in the blood before reaching the required site. Nanotechnology and
              microemulsion technology provide a novel approach to overcome these
              limitations. In this project, a model therapeutic agent, an anticancer drug,
              has been chosen for the development of an effective formulation. Microemulsion
              will eliminate hydrolysis of the therapeutic agent and also provide
              thermodynamically stable nano-size encapsulates for further development of the
              temperature-sensitive release characteristics of the end product. These
              nanoencapsulates will circulate in the blood for the long time and therapeutic
              agent can be delivered at the site of interest (tumor cells) by increasing
              temperature of that site with the help of a laser.

The commercial
              applications of this project are in the area of pharmaceutical drug delivery.
