Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop
              enabling technology for construction of a small, low cost fiber optic switch.
              The switch will be based upon vertical cavity surface emitting laser arrays and
              PIN photodiode arrays, both coupled directly to a silicon switching/interfacing
              integrated circuit. The switch design and fabrication processes will be enabled
              by new interconnect technologies using direct-write of both organic materials
              and liquid metals using ink jet printing technology.   Collimating or focusing
              polymer microlenses will be printed directly onto the vertical cavity surface
              emitting laser arrays with photolithographic accuracy, coupling the output of
              the vertical cavity surface emitting lasers directly into arrays of multimode
              optical fibers.  The same will be true for coupling into detector arrays. 
              Solder-Jet technology will be used to electrically interconnect the active
              optical elements to the silicon integrated circuit with practically zero
              interconnect distance, drastically decreasing parasitic effects
     The
              optical and electrical interconnect methods developed in this project will have
              commercial applications far broader than the fiber optic switch.  Some of the
              other applications include: fiber optic transceivers, imaging sensors,
              read/write heads, laser sources for printers, optical sensors for medical
              diagnostics, micro-assembly, micro-electromechanical machines packaging and
              3D-packaging.
