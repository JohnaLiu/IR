Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I Project will
              develop a methodology for improved diagnosis and treatment of cancer by
              combining therapy and imaging in the same drug. Specifically, this study
              proposes to bind polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated magnetic nanopheres to a
              cancer targeting therapeutic agent (doxorubicin encapsulated temperature
              sensitive liposomes and hydrogels) and chelated to Tc-99m for imaging. After
              administration, the drug will be concentrated at the site of action by external
              magnetic guidance, verified by gamma camera imaging and released to the tumor
              using herperthermia treatment. A tumor specific marker bound to the complex
              will improve drug transport into the tumor. Once inside the tumor, therapeutic
              agents will be released to kill the cancer cells. Specific Goals of this Phase
              I Project are: (1) to develop the necessary chemistry and conjugation, (2) to
              examine the magnetic susceptibility of the complex using an in vitro flow
              model, and (3) to conduct tests in an in vitro cell culture model.

The
              commercial applications of this project are in the treatment of cancer. The
              proposed method will enhance the efficacy of cancer treatment by ensuring that
              the drug reaches the target tissue while minimizing non-target tissue uptake.
