Abstract    :
              The award supports the acquisition of high-resolution, absolute-dated speleothem
              records of the Asian Monsoon.  Such records will lead to an understanding of
              the mechanisms that control the Asian Monsoon during all portions of
              glacial-interglacial cycles over the last 200,000 years.  They will also
              constrain the relative timing of change in the Monsoon and the climate in other
              regions.

This important new research effort builds upon previous work by the
              investigators that demonstrates a link between North Atlantic climate and the
              East Asian Monsoon, which originates from the warmest portion of the tropical
              oceans (the West Pacific Warm Pool).  This research explores the links between
              tropical and high northern latitude climate and abrupt climatic shifts.  For
              example, the end of the Younger Dryas is marked by a large and rapid change in
              East Asian Monsoon intensity.  The change occurred in less than 10 years and is
              synchronous, within an error of approximately 100 years, with a similarly rapid
              rise in Greenland temperature.

The assembled research team represents a
              strong international collaboration among American and Chinese researchers and
              institutions.  Both the United States and China are partners in the research as
              both supply research funds and expertise to help the research succeed.
