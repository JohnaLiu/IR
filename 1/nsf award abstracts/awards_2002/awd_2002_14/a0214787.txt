Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
              develop a fast density functional (DFT) program for accurate electronic
              structure calculations on medium-sized molecules (30-200+ atoms). The proposed
              method will have the same accuracy as traditional integral-based DFT codes, but
              will be an order of magnitude  faster, with the speed-up increasing with system
              size. The increased efficiency is particularly important for molecular dynamics
              applications. In the Phase I project, the accuracy and speed of the method for
              single-point DFT energies will be demonstrated. In a follow on Phase II
              project, a fully functioning program will be developed, including gradients
              (for geometry optimization and dynamics), second derivatives (for vibrational
              frequencies), NMR chemical shifts and other important molecular properties. The
              code will be parallelized, integrated into our PQS program and supplied with
              our QuantumStation, a combined hardware-software package for running parallel
              implementations of the most important methods of quantum chemistry. 

The
              commercial application of this project is in the area of software development
              for academic and business community involved in biological and biomedical
              research.
