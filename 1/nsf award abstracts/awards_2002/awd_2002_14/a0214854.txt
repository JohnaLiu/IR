Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to apply
              Multi Photon Detection technique (MPD) to quantify proteins bound to a
              microarray of antibodies. The first arrays will target cytokines, the important
              secreted proteins that regulate the immune system. The goals of this project
              are to create an immunoassay based protein-chip for the concurrent measurment
              of all the cytokines down to the level of a few zeptomole/ sample,  to
              implement improved P-chip designs using peptide nucleic acid linkers,  and to
              study the levels of cytokines in cell cultures and human samples. By analyzing
              patterns of protein expression and their post-translational modifications,
              correlations of functions and/or of disease states with specific protein
              expression patterns are expected to be established.

The commercial
              applications of this project are in the area of medical diagnostics.
