Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an
              entire new class of LC materials consisting of  unique mixtures of polar and
              nonpolar nematic LCs that form an induced smectic-A phase with bilayer or
              multilayer microstructures. The proposed Induced Smetic-A LCs (ISALCs) are
              intrinsically low in viscosity, and therefore their optical properties can be
              electrically switched at low voltages without power pulse heating. ISALC
              materials will significantly improve the performance of flat panel displays,
              electro-optic devices, and storage media with infinitely long-term intrinsic
              memory. In contrast, current monolayer smectic-A LCs are highly viscous, and
              thus require either very high voltage for electrical driving or complicated
              thermal addressing. Other LC materials such as ferroelectric smectic-C and
              cholesteric require careful treatment of substrate surfaces and precise
              thickness of LC layers, which has limited their widespread commercial use.
              

The commercial applications of these materials include scientific and
              industrial instrumentation ranging from microelectronics manufacturing,
              telecommunications, computers, and training and simulation systems, and
              extending to security control systems.
