Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will prove
              that laser annealing can crystallize thin films of SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) to a device
              ready quality, while keeping the substrate temperature at a level compatible
              with CMOS components. SBT films are strong candidates for use in non-volatile
              ferroelectric memory applications (FeRAM), due to their "fatigue-free"
              read/write performance and low voltage operation. However, SBT films typically
              require a post deposition-annealing step (> 700 C in oxygen) to crystallize the
              films and achieve optimum performance. This high temperature-annealing step is
              incompatible with current IC fabrication schemes, particularly designs that use
              tungsten for the first level contacts. This laser-annealing tool will prevent
              thermal damage to the underlying CMOS structures, and enable SBT film
              acceptance in FeRAM device applications.  The project will show proof of
              concept by annealing films and demonstrating device performance.
    
              Ferroelectrics are poised to rapidly expand into the several billion-dollar
              non-volatile memory markets. This tool will accelerate this market penetration
              and thereby become a key component of a multiple hundreds of million dollars
              per year tool market.
