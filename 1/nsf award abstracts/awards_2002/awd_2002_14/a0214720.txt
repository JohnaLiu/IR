This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project
              proposesto develop  a new approach to protein x-ray crystallography using
              convergent beams. This new technology is based on the development of convergent
              beam x-ray optics and of protein diffraction theory with 2-dimensional
              convergent x-ray beams. Compared with conventional collimating optics,
              convergent beam optics can provide x-ray beams with orders of magnitude higher
              flux density, which is crucial for structure measurements with small protein
              crystals (less than 100 um) using low-power laboratory-based x-ray sources. In
              this Phase I project, simulation diffraction patterns for different protein
              crystals will be generated by a new software package CBMPRO to theoretically
              evaluate the feasibility for determination of protein crystal quality, unit
              cell, space group, and structure.

The commercial application of this project
              is in the area of proteomics.
