Abstract    :
              This award uses funds to develop a multiproxy record of the paleohydrology and
              paleolimnology of Flathead Lake, Montana utilizing the discharge record into
              the lake from winter snowpack.  This record will be used to determine the
              natural variability of extreme hydrologic events in the region and correlated
              to the position of the Alleutian Low, jet stream, and several climatic
              indices.

Field work will be undertaken to obtain long cores from the lake
              and proxy indicators of discharge (grain size) and hydroclimate (diatoms and
              ostracodes) will be developed in the laboratory.  Proxy indicators will be
              calibrated using existing short cores covering historic intervals before being
              applied to the longer down-core sequences.  

The broader impacts of this
              proposed research center on providing important information on the nature of
              abrupt climate change as well as the frequency, duration and magnitude of major
              hydrologic events in the region.  These in turn are directly applicable to
              management of water resources and prediction of how anthropogenic changes will
              effect hydrology of the region.
