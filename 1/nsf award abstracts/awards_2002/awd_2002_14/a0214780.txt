Abstract    :
              This project will install a nitrate sensor and a set of optical sensors on two
              moorings that will be deployed along the Chukchi shelf during the Shelf-Basins
              Interactions (SBI) field program in 2002. The currently funded SBI mooring
              program does not include any biochemical or optical sensors in its
              instrumentation array and the SBI Scientific Steering Committee has strongly
              recommended that such types of sensors be added to provide a better
              understanding of the variability of physical and biological processes that
              influence the exchange of energy and material between the shelf and the deep
              basin. The SBI mooring PI's have agreed to accommodate these instruments on
              their array. This project will attempt to increase the operational time and
              capability of these instruments and will provide a record of a primary nutrient
              and the optical properties of the upper water column during the first year of
              the SBI field program.
