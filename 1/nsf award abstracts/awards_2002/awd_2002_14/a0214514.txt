Abstract    :
              The Doctoral Dissertation student produces a computerized database of all
              roll-call votes cast in the California Assembly since 1849.  Using a
              Poole-Rosenthal method of analyzing the ideological composition of the US has
              greatly increased the understanding of the Congress.  By employing roll data
              from every Congressional session and assuming that each member's ideological
              position is relatively fixed from one session to the next, Poole and Rosenthal
              are able to locate all members of Congress throughout its history in a common
              ideological space.  Given this cross-temporally comparable space, they are able
              to address questions of how, for example, partisan divergence, regional
              alignment, and the dimensionality of political conflict have changed over time.
               While the leverage of this approach clearly extends beyond the US Congress,
              there are few such applications in the literature.  In this grant, the student
              brings the power of Poole and Rosenthal's method to the study of party and
              ideology within California's state legislature.  The dissertation will unravel
              the dynamics of partisanship in the California legislature and, in particular,
              how these dynamics are affected by electoral institutions, such as rules
              governing primary elections, which have varied considerably across California's
              history.  In this case, the data generated are used to measure the degree of
              partisan alignment and polarization through California's history.  Application
              of these data to other central questions of legislative scholarship such as the
              effects of term limits, legislative professionalization, or the presence of the
              ballot initiative come quickly to mind.  The researcher has already completed
              collection of these data for 1957-1958, 1967-1968, 1977-1978, 1987-1988, and
              1993-2001 sessions.

This is a dataset that will be used by other scholars
              interested in these questions.
