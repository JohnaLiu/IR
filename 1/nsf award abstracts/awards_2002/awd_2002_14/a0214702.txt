Abstract    :
              In transitional and developing economies, examples abound of ways in which
              existing institutions and norms either hinder or promote the widening of
              markets. By reforming institutions that distort individual and firm decisions,
              informed policymakers usually hope to increase responsiveness to market
              signals, facilitate more efficient allocation of resources, and promote
              long-term growth. At the same time, important reforms can be politically
              difficult to implement if the institutions involved provide security to
              individuals who are not able to benefit from opportunities provided by greater
              access to markets. This research examines the trade-off between responsiveness 
              and security from the perspective of villages in rural China. Since the
              beginning of China's reform period over twenty years ago, local village leader
              control over decisions about land allocation has helped to insure that all
              rural residents have access to farm income. Insecurity of land tenure, however,
              distorts incentives of farmers and may limit household response to
              opportunities provided by access to off-farm markets.
