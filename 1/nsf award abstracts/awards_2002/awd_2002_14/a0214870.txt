This is a 36-month AWARE project submitted by Dr.
              Jeffery Brantingham, Santa Fe Institute with Professor MA Haizhou, Qinghai
              Institute of Salt Lakes, Xinning, China, to study the Pleistocene
              hunter-gatherers of the Tibetan Plateau, and to provide an REU training
              opportunity for six "exceptional" U.S. undergraduate students.   This is an
              excellent proposal to understand late Pleistocene human colonization and
              adaptation to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region.  This study nicely integrates
              archeological, paleo-environmental, and geochronological research strategies to
              answer questions of broad importance in the study of evolution of behaviorally
              modern humans.   This project provides excellent opportunities for U.S.
              undergraduate students to be trained in archeology and to learn to carry out
              field research in the western part of China.  It also develops paleoclimatic
              proxy records that can be integrated into regional and global models of climate
              variability and change.  The NSF and the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly
              support this project.
