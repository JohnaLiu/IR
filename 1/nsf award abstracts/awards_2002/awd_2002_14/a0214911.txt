This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project
              proposes to develop an enhanced spectral interferometry method for biological
              and biomedical applications. This method will provide rapid, high resolution
              optical imaging and can be easily coupled with fiber optics for in-vivo
              applications using endoscopes, catheters and similar devices. The Phase I
              Project will demontrate the utility of enhance spectral interferometry for
              cross-sectional imaging in biological tissues. In the follow on Phase II
              Project,  a fiber
optic imaging spectral interferometer capable of high speed
              will be developed.

The commercial applications of this project are in the
              area of biomedical devices and instrumentation. This technology will be applied
               to a variety of biomedical research and clinical needs including monitoring of
              tissue response to drugs or radiation exposure, detection of cancerous and
              pre-cancerous tissues, and the imaging of venous and arterial structures and
              ocular pathologies.
