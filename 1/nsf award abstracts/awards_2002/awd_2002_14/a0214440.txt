Abstract    :
              Northwestern University supports a Research Experiences for Science Teachers
              activity that hosts 15 teachers for each summer in 2002-2005.  The goals of the
              activity are to facilitate meaningful interactions between college professors
              and pre-college teachers, to translate those interactions into practical
              classroom tools, and to develop a resource network for disseminating the
              insight and tools that teachers acquire. The RET activity, which continues
              throughout the school year and involves pre-college teachers as well as
              community college faculty, includes development by the teachers of "toolkits"
              or teaching tools that draw from the teachers' research experience and that
              relate to classroom curricula. The "toolkits" are made available online.
