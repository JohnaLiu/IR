This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project
              proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of developing a label-free biochip for
              applications in genomics, proteomics, life sciences, and pharmaceutical
              research. Biochips are intended to enable rapid, massively parallel analyses
              for such applications. However, the typical biochip relies on the use of labels
              to detect the binding event. Labels are expensive, especially
              for
high-throughput screening (HTS), and can change the chemistry of the
              ligand. The binding of a low-molecular weight ligand is particularly difficult
              to detect by any current (or emerging) biochip technology. During the Phase I
              project, experiments are planned to show(1)  that the proposed
technology can
              be used to  detect hormones, drugs, metabolites, carbohydrates, and signal
              transduction molecules in the 100-500 Da size range binding to enzymes,
              lectins, and DNA; (2) that this technology  can differentiate among
              cross-reactive ligands that bind to a given biomolecule; (3) that the signal is
              specific to ligand binding and is not affected by artifacts that affect other
              biochips; (4) that protein denaturation caused by carrier solvents can be
              detected, and (5) that chip read-out will be exceptionally sensitive and rapid.
              

The commercial applications of this project are likely to be in a number of
              different  areas. They include the markets for medical diagnostics,
              environmental monitoring,  food and beverage safety, proteomics, drug discovery
              and development, biomolecule development, and ultra high-throughput
              screening.
