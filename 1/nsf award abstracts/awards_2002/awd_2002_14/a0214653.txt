Abstract    :
              The Department of Statistics at the University of Connecticut 
will purchase a
              Compaq Professional XP1000 EV6 667MHz UNIX
systems, ten DELL 1.70GHz dual
              processors power workstations,
and an HP Color LaserJet printer, which will be
              dedicated to
the support of research in mathematical statistics,
              statistical
methodology, statistical computing, complex statistical
              modeling,
and statistical software development.  The equipment will be
used
              for several research projects, including, Bayesian analysis
of multivariate
              categorical data and missing covariate data,
methodology for analyzing spatial
              data, statistical inferences
for contingency tables, cDNA microarrays, the
              American travel
survey, statistical analyses for infinite variance
              stable
processes, multivariate survival data and highway accidents
data, and
              wavelet modeling of high-frequency data.

Additionally, the machines will
              greatly enhance departmental
research and education infrastructure at all
              levels. They will
be made available  to all departmental faculty, graduate
              students
