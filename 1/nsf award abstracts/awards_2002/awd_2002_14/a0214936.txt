Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will investigate
              the feasibility of employing novel conducting polymers (e.g. poly
              3,4-diphenylpyrrole) to prepare solid state gas sensors. The proposed sensor
              will be low cost and selective to a specific class of chemical compounds,
              namely chlorinated hydrocarbons. The proposed sensor will also be capable of
              operating at room temperature, thus eliminating the need for significant power
              consumption and making the development of small, selective, low-cost, and
              portable detectors feasible. This project will demonstrate the feasibility of
              preparing solid-state gas sensors based upon this material. Variations in
              materials chemistry, including monomer composition and dopant ion, will be used
              to develop sensors that are highly stable, sensitive, and selective to
              chlorinated hydrocarbons.

This sensor technology will complement
              Nanomaterials Research's existing product line by continuing the development of
              low cost sensor technologies that provide unique commercial advantages. The
              proposed sensor will be marketed to companies who manufacture instrumentation
              for health and safety, environmental monitoring and process control
              applications.
