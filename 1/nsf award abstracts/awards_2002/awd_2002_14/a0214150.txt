Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will describe a new way
              to use specially designed low loss dielectric ribbons (with attenuation as much
              as 100 times less than that of a conventional circular polymer rod at Ka band),
              made with either alumina, silicon, InP or
GaAs as fundamental building blocks
              for electronic integrated circuits or interconnects. The absence of metallic
              structures in the ribbon approach provides the possibility of high power
              carrying capability. 

 This technology offers the possibility of directly
              incorporating active devices with a low-loss transmission medium, provides the
              foundation for ultra-high-speed integrated circuits. Major commercial markets
              include the automobile, semiconductor, computer, and satellite industries.
