Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
              develop  a new type of
nanoengineered surface to epitaxially nucleate protein
              crystals. These surfaces should greatly accelerate most high throughput
              Structural Genomics efforts. The basic concept for the epitaxial surfaces is to
              prepare a surface that possesses chemical modulations commensurate in size and
              periodicity to protein unit cells. It is speculated that exposure of the
              protein growth solution to certain compositional periodicities (5-100 nm) on
              the surface of the heterogeneous nucleants induces an ordered layer of sorbed
              protein molecules which form the incipient nucleus of the protein crystal.
              Since for a given unknown protein the unit cell is not known in advance, the
              heterogeneous nucleants are prepared as a combinatorial library in a chip based
              format, with a wide variety of modulations per unit chip area. In this Phase I
              proposal, methods and techniques will be developed  to allow a more efficient
              survey of surfaces and proteins with the goal of better defining the role of
              the surfaces in inducing nucleation.

The commercial applications of this
              project are in the area of biological research and in drug discovery and
              development.
