     The investigator derives and studies mathematical models
              for
several different processes involved with cell division, focusing
on E.
              coli cells because of the wealth of data available.  A
mature cell replicates
              its DNA.  The daughter DNA strands must
move into the halves of the mature
              cell, and finally, the cell
divides.  The relative timing of these events is
              crucial for the
division into viable daughter cells, and placement of the
              septum
must divide the cell and its DNA into relatively equal halves.
Once
              replication begins,the cell then must become unable to start
replication again
              until the cell is sufficiently mature.
Sequestration is responsible for this
              eclipse period, where the
new DNA strand binds to sites in the membrane,
              thereby blocking
the oriC site and dnaA transcription regulation site, keeping
              the
replication initiation from occurring too soon.  This process
              of
sequestration and de-sequestration is therefore (at least
partially)
              responsible for the timing of cell division events.
The mathematical model
              predicts the probability of each of the
sequestration sites being sequestered,
              as a function of time.  The
replicated DNA strands are moved apart in the
              longitudinal
direction (towards the cell poles) in order to assure exactly
              one
set of chromosomes in each daughter cell.  The process by which
this
              occurs is unknown, but the timing of this event is crucial
to viability.  The
              project studies viable models for this
seqregation.  The site for septation is
              marked by formation of a
Z-ring at the center of the rod-shaped cell, halfway
              between the
poles.  This Z-ring is involved in causing the cell to form
              a
septum between the daughter halves.  Placement of the Z-ring at
the center
              is a result of the cooperative actions of three
proteins from the min locus of
              the DNA.  Three proteins behave in
an oscillatory manner, with MinD
              alternately forming a layer on
the cell membrane near one pole, then
              disassembling and
re-forming at the other pole.  The investigator studies a
              model
for the dynamics of the Min system.
     The investigaor develops
              mathematical models to improve the
understanding of the biology of cell
              division in E. coli.  The
basic philosophy is to determine mechanisms that can
              describe
observed events, and to evaluate whether these mechanisms
              can
operate for reasonable parameter values, that is, whether the
kinetic
              rates, diffusivities, and concentrations are within
reasonable ranges of
              observed values.  Location and timing of
cellular events is an important
              aspect of molecular biology.
Moreover, mathematical models that incorporate
              intracellular
transport and reactions, including reactions with
              organelles,
should prove to be of general applicability to cellular
              biology.
Such models can focus biological research on aspects of
              molecular
dynamics that otherwise seem unconnected.
