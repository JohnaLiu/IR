This award provides three years of Phase I research laboratory
              technician support in the Department of Geology and Planetary Science
              Geochemistry Facility at the University of Pittsburgh.  The University is
              providing 50% of the salary and fringe benefits for this position. The
              facilities comprise sample preparation, clean chemistry, and instrumentation
              laboratories. Major instruments include an inductively coupled plasma-atomic
              emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) and an NSF-funded multicollector thermal
              ionization mass spectrometer (TIMS). The research technician is responsible for
              day-to-day operation of the labs, maintenance of equipment, training of
              collaborators and students, and assistance with method development.  In
              addition to facilitating hands-on class and outreach activities, this position
              will provide vital support for research projects focused on Quaternary soil
              development and paleoclimatology, modeling of weathering in watersheds,
              development of acid mine drainage, Precambrian paleoenvironments, and igneous
              geochemistry.
