This grant provides support to University of Wyoming
              seismologists to reformat, place on modern media and make accessible via the
              internet, common depth point (CDP) and vertical seismic profiles (VSP)
              collected within the Kola borehole drilled in Russia (the deepest borehole in
              the world).  All of this data will be made freely available to the broader
              scientific community through the IRIS Data Management System (DMS).
