The project will create
              nationally representative datasets for the study of slavery and slaveholding in
              the mid-nineteenth century United States.  New samples will be added to the
              Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), a census database spanning the
              period from 1850 through 2000.  Using the 1850 Census of Slave Inhabitants, the
              project will construct (1) a random sample of the slave population with all
              available slave and holding characteristics, (2) a smaller sample of the slave
              population obtained by linking slaveholders in the existing 1850 free sample to
              the slaves they held in the Census of Slave Inhabitants, and (3) a new version
              of the IPUMS 1850 freed population sample that identifies slaveholders in the
              existing dataset and includes a representative sample of slaves.  These samples
              will complement similar samples of the 1860 slave population currently being
              created by the PIs.

Large-scale nationally representative samples of the
              population censuses have transformed our understanding of American social,
              economic, and demographic history.  The samples of the 1850 slave population
              will provide the earliest representative body of individual-level data on U.S.
              slaves and slaveholders.  When used in conjunction with samples from the 1860
              slave schedules this project will allow the analysis of change over time in the
              critical decade preceding the Civil War.  Since 1850 and 1850 slave schedules
              were the only national individual-level censuses of the slave population, a
              sample of the 1850 slave census will provide a baseline for the study of the
              African-American population.
