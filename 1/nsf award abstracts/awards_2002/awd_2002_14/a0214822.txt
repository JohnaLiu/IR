Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
              develop  a software platform, GeneRx for depression. This platform will
              incorporate pharmacogenetics and nonlinear adaptive algorithms toward
              optimizing anti-depressant treatment on a patient-specific basis. In this Phase
              I project, a predictive algorithm will be developed using genetic and medical
              chart information from patients diagnosed with major depressive disorders who
              have taken the anti-depressant citalopram.  Genetic data will be acquired by
              genotyping DNA from blood samples for selected single nucleotide polymorphisms
              (SNPs) in genes that have been directly affected by citalopram. Prediction of
              response to citalopram is important in order to avoid  delays in receiving 
              adequate treatment and to avoid  exposure to unnecessary side effects.

The
              commercial applications of this project are in the area of healthcare
              management and delivery.
