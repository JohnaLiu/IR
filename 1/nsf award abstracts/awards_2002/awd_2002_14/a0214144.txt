Abstract    :
              Science Summary:  This study will obtain and analyze sediment cores recovered in
              the subtropical western North Atlantic off Cape Hatteras.   Multiproxy study of
              the cores will be done to determine gradients in sea surface temperature and
              depth gradients in temperature and nutrient content.  Surface water proxies
              will include oxygen isotope and Mg/Ca measurements of planktic foraminifers. 
              Bottom water proxies will include oxygen and carbon isotope,  Mg/Ca, Cd/Ca, 
              and Ba/Ca of benthic foraminifers.  Sample resolution of selected time-series
              studies for the entire Holocene will resolve millennial scale variability. 
              More detailed sampling of the last 3,000 years will be done in several cores to
              study century scale variability of the late Holocene.  Age models  will be
              based on AMS 14C dates space at about 500 yr intervals.
