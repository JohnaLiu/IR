Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
              the feasibility of a miniaturized fast-response oxygen sensor.  Fuel efficiency
              of automotive engines and power generating systems improve when operated under
              lean-burn conditions. Oxygen monitoring in industrial processes promise higher
              productivity while effective fire fighting requires information regarding local
              combustion conditions. These applications all require in-situ oxygen sensors
              that combine rapid response, sensitivity, selectivity, resistance to fouling,
              and thermal and chemical robustness. The firm proposes to develop an Oxygen
              Sensor by combining key innovations including (1) unique thin-film
              semiconducting metal-oxides (SMO) sensitive to oxygen concentration in the
              0.001-21 percent range, with rapid (10-100 ms) response time, and temperature
              insensitivity in the 700-1000....C range, and (2) refractory SiC microhotplate
              gas sensor platform capable of operating to 1000....C, with only 20 mW power
              consumption. 

Commercial application of the proposed oxygen sensors includes
              automotive and aeronautic propulsion systems, power generation, incineration,
              food packaging technology, and fire fighting.
