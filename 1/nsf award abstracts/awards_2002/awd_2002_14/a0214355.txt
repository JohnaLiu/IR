This grant supports a major upgrade to the NSF research
              community's Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver pool, critical for
              high-precision GPS campaign measurements to support Earth sciences related
              research. Thirty new generation GPS receivers will be purchased over three
              years, maintaining a state-of-the-art receiver pool that ensures the UNAVCO
              Facility's continued leadership in geodetic GPS technology for campaign
              applications. The new GPS receivers will benefit the research community with
              improved features including better data quality, reduced power consumption,
              smaller size, and increased memory. The main use of the UNAVCO equipment pool
              continues to be traditional millimeter-level precision crustal deformation GPS
              campaigns involving data collection for several days per survey point, and 24
              new receivers are dedicated to such support. An additional six receivers with
              added capability will also support kinematic, rapid static, and real-time
              kinematic applications that require centimeter-level precision. As new
              equipment becomes available for pool use, the current pool receivers will be
              phased out of the pool and into NSF funded research projects for use in
              permanent GPS installations.
