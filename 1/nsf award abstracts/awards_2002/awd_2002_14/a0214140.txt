Abstract    :
              This project investigates the sources of the different experiences with regard
              to unemployment rates of the various countries of Western Europe over the past
              three decades.  Its goal is to extend previous work in three directions:  The
              first is to extend previous reduced form estimation of the relation between
              unemployment shocks, and institutions, across European countries by looking
              separately at the effects on flows and on duration and unemployment and on
              vacancies. The second is to look at the role of collective bargaining and union
              attitudes in explaining both the general rise and later decline in unemployment
              as well as differences across European countries. The third is to explore
              further the role of labor market institutions by looking at the links between
              institutions, average unemployment duration and the dynamic effects of shocks
              on unemployment and to characterize the optimal set of labor market
              institutions in the presence of incomplete insurance and ex-post wage
              bargaining.
