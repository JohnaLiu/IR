Abstract    :
              Many studies of individual decision-making have shown that people rely on
              heuristics that lead to systematic biases.  Many economists belief that market
              forces decrease the prevalence of such biases. This research consists of a
              series of experiments that add an insurance market to tests of decision-making
              under uncertainty.  We address the question of whether insurance markets create
              a byproduct - information - that helps people to better understand risk and
              therefore make better decisions.  For example, if a smoker finds out that the
              price for purchasing life insurance is higher than for a non-smoker, this might
              convey more easily understood information about the increased risk of smoking
              than would statistical tables.  Our hope is that this research will help
              increase the understanding of how individuals process and use information from
              insurance markets, and therefore how information about risks might be presented
              in a more easily understood manner.
