Abstract    :
              
This application seeks support for a basic research symposium designed to
              stimulate a thorough discussion of areas of controversy in the field of
              vestibular physiology and related movement control.  Over the course of 2 and
              1/2 days, there will be six workshops concerning active research areas.  We
              will bring together scientists interested in psychophysics, systems level
              neuroscience, and cellular and molecular mechanisms to facilitate discussions
              that incorporate a broad perspective.  This format will provide basic
              information to the field at large, help resolve issues by direct confrontation
              of scientists with disparate views and inform younger investigators about the
              important issues in the field that they are entering.  Indeed, the principal
              objective of this grant is to generate funds so that junior investigators and
              women and minority participants who are making exciting contributions to the
              field but who have limited travel funds may attend the meeting. An airing of
              the issues raised in this symposium will ultimately guide the clinical
              application of our knowledge in persons with balance and orientation problems,
              as well as a variety of motion-induced visual disorders.
