Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 Project is  to investigate
              the technical feasibility for harvesting natural carotenoids from the marine
              algae, "Dunaliella salina". Due to the high capital and operating costs
              associated with existing technologies, the current price of natural
              beta-carotene is about twice that of the synthetic variety. By enabling the
              commercial production of natural beta-carotene at a cost
closer to that of the
              synthetic product, this research is expected to lead to a significant growth of
              the "natural beta-carotene" market. The specific objective of the Phase I
              research is to determine the feasibility of a low-cost method to harvest the
              above mentioned marine algae from the growth medium and to extract the
              beta-carotene from this algae. The technology to be developed in this project
              could also be used to harvest and to purify other carotenoids from the algae.

                  The commercial application of this project will be in the beta-carotene
              market. Beta-carotene is currently used for a wide range of applications : as a
              nutritional supplement, as an agent for food fortification, as an animal feed,
              and as a food colorant.
