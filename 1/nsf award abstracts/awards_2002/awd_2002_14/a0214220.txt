Abstract    :
              This study will help us understand the exchange of carbon dioxide and water
              vapor between the biosphere and the atmosphere.   We will explore factors
              affecting the rates of gas exchange (photosynthesis and respiration) for
              representative ecosystems in the southwestern US.  We will determine if remote
              sensing (optical and thermal measurement from a distance) can detect subtle
              alterations in the rates of photosynthesis and respiration.  This "breathing of
              the planet" helps regulate our atmosphere and influences our climate, and is
              further being affected by human impacts on the atmosphere and climate in ways
              that are not yet fully understood.  In addition to the science goals of
              understanding terrestrial gas exchange, we will provide training opportunities
              for undergraduate and master's students.  Findings from the project will be
              made available to the larger community using the internet, and can be used to
              help validate data products emerging from new aircraft and satellite sensors.
