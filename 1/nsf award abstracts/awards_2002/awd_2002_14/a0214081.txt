Abstract    :
              
When estimating or testing economic relationships, economists often discover
              that the data they plan to use is not drawn randomly from the target population
              for which they wish to draw an inference. Instead, the observations are found
              to be sampled from a related but different distribution. If this feature is not
              taken into account when doing statistical analysis,  subsequent inference can
              be seriously off the mark. This phenomenon is commonly called selection bias.
              An important class of models in microeconometrics is characterized in terms of
              conditional moment restrictions. Thhis develops a new efficient semiparametric
              approach for conducting inference in models with conditional moment
              restrictions when the target population is stratified.
