Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on
              providing ambient power for wireless smart sensor units used for
              condition-based monitoring. Specifically, this project is to develop a
              Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS)-based power-scavenging module.  Current
              research in the area of ambient power has established a strong foundation from
              which future solutions in the area of condition-based maintenance will take
              shape.  Research will also be performed on rare earth magnets to custom design
              thin permanent magnets that will produce a high-flux density in the compactly
              designed system.  The proposed component will provide power through the
              conversion of ambient machine vibration using electromagnetic induction. 
              Design objectives include the optimization of energy-scavenging efficiency in
              varying environmental conditions, operating conditions, and system types.  The
              proposed system uses MEMS technology to realize small dimensions (one-inch
              square and less than 0.5 cm. thick) and energy storage
              capabilities.

Commercial applications include industrial machinery,
              vehicles, air conditioners, and refrigerators. Additional options are large
              markets such as building controls and manufacturing.
