This collaborative
              research by an anthropologist at Texas A& M University, a chemist at Claremont
              McKenna College, and a physician at the East-Kazakhstan Oblast State Agency for
              Health Care will examine perceived risk from radiation exposure at a former
              Soviet nuclear test site near Semipalatinsk, Kazakhstan. Some persons engage in
              high-risk activities such as mining copper at the former test site, and some
              individuals continue to live near it. The project will study how three social
              groups, Kazakh villagers, local research scientists, and local health care
              workers, perceive the risk from radiation exposure. Using participant
              observation, a survey of 30 research scientists, 100 health care workers and
              400 villagers in two villages (a test village close to, and a control village
              distant from the site), the project will assess the perceived risk in the past,
              the perceived risk at present, and the understanding of health risks due to
              radiation exposure. The study will contribute to the understanding of cultural
              differences in how people react to perceived risk in a situation where the
              radiation exposure is actual, not hypothetical, where mistrust of the
              government is pervasive, and where informants use traditional as well as modern
              ways of dealing with their situation. The study will advance our understanding
              of how local culture affects risk perception and political activity relevant to
              the understanding of risk.
