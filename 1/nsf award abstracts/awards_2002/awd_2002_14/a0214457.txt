Abstract    :
              The Center for Engineering Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) is a new
              multi-university, multi-disciplinary Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center (I/UCRC).  The vision for the center is to provide integrated solutions
              to logistics problems, through modeling, analysis and intelligent-systems
              technologies.

The four universities involved in this proposal, the
              University of Arkansas, serving as the lead institution, the University of
              Oklahoma, the University of Louisville, and Oklahoma State University are
              assuming a leadership role in engineering logistics research and
              education.

The scope of CELDi will address (1) value-adding processes that
              create time and place utility (transportation, material handling, and
              distribution), (2) value-sustaining processes that prolong useful life
              (maintenance, repair, and rework), and (3) value-recovering processes that
              conserve scarce resources and enhance societal goodwill (returns,
              refurbishment, and recycling).
