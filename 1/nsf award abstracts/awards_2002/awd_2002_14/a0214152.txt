Abstract    :
                 The Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology (SBN) is fairly young (founded
              1995), 
and expects attendance of around 300 at this sixth Annual Meeting. 
              The SBN, in its 
meetings and its journal (Hormones & Behavior) uniquely
              emphasizes multidisciplinary 
integration of cellular and molecular concepts
              into a functional framework involving the 
brain, behavior, development,
              evolution and the ecology of social behavior.  This 
concentration linking
              hormones to many areas of behavior, including both field and 
laboratory
              approaches, makes this focal meeting different from other meetings in the
              
field.  The conference organizers are highly regarded and experienced, the
              topics are 
timely, and in addition to scientific talks there are particular
              sessions planned for 
students and trainees on 'survival skills',
              'meet-the-professor' lunches, 'alternative 
careers' and poster sessions with
              awards expanded to include undergraduate work.   
Dissemination of the
              conference findings will be through a special supplemental issue of 
Hormones
              & Behavior.  The SBN meetings strongly emphasize bringing in students
              
(graduate and undergraduate, representing 1/3 of the total membership) and
              postdocs 
for interdisciplinary interactions with established investigators.

                The potential impact of this conference is high in the fields of
              neuroendocrinology and 
behavioral neuroscience, because of the focused
              discussions shaping future work, the 
potential to develop new
              cross-disciplinary collaborations, and the likely interactions and
              
introductions essential to career development of young investigators. Funding
              from NSF 
is important to help students, postdocs, and young researchers
              attend, and for some 
career development workshop speakers who are not
              currently society members.
