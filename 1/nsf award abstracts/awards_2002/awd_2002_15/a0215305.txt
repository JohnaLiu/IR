Abstract    :
              This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is directed to
              the development of a novel planar excimer lamp. This lamp design offers
              numerous potential advantages over conventional cylindrical coaxial lamps which
              includes high irradiance (>100 mW/cm2), uniform area illumination, compact
              size, improves cooling, longer life, and lower cost. This lamp will be designed
              to be easily integrated able in tools used in the manufacture of electronic
              devices. Excimer lamp applications include in-situ reticule cleaning, in-situ
              pre-deposition cleaning, photochemical vapor deposition, and UV curing.
              Conventional UV lamps are inadequate for these tasks.  Excimer lasers, which
              can easily illuminate a large field size, are often inadequate at integrating
              into a production tool, and have a very high cost of ownership. Three  goals 
              has been established to guide this work in: 1) design and fabricate a planar
              excimer lamp with novel electrode structure and lamp cell design, 2) evaluate
              the area uniformity of the narrow band excimer emission, and 3) measure the UV
              spectra, radiant power output, and efficiency of the lamp filled with KrCl*
              (222 nm) or XeCl*(308 nm).

The technology, once successfully developed, will
              be used the semiconductor manufacturing industry.
