This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              proposes to improve delivery of clinically used drugs through formulation of a
              non-toxic, tissue-specific drug delivery vehicle. A number of drugs and drug
              delivery vehicles cause toxic side effects,thereby limiting the drug dose that
              can be administered. This Phase I Project proposes to solve these problems by
              using a proprietary mixture of non-phospholipid lipids for drug delivery.
              Suspensions of lipid-coated microbubbles (LCM), made with this lipid mixture,
              have been found to be highly tumor selective. Paclitaxel, delivered in LCM, has
              been shown to reduce tumors in rats more effectively when compared to
              paclitaxel delivered in the traditional vehicle, and produced less systemic
              toxicity. However, there are no methods currently available to generate LCM on
              a commercial scale. In the course of this Phase I Project,  lipid nanoparticles
              from the proprietary lipid mixture will be developed using a high pressure
              homogenizer. This will be followed by the formulation of a number of clinically
              used drugs in lipid and trsting of these formulations in cultured tumor
              cells.

The commercial application of this project will be in the area of
              pharmaceutical drug delivery.
