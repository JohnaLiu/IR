ABSTRACT

The Department of Mathematics at the Pennsylvania
              State
University will purchase a 64-node parallel PC cluster
to be dedicated
              to the support of research and teaching
in the mathematical sciences. In
              particular, the PC
cluster will be used to support the research projects
of
              faculty members in the areas of the numerical
solution of partial differential
              equations in fluid
dynamics and material sciences, and computational
finance
              and in the studies of general numerical
techniques such as parallel multigrid
              algorithms and
quasi-Monte Carlo methods.  In particular, the
              projects
include studies of important issues concerning modeling
and
              simulations of non-Newtonian flows, liquid crystals,
quantized vortices, water
              waves and fuel cells. Much of
the research efforts rely critically on
              the
establishment of the proposed PC cluster.

The proposal involves an
              integrated collaboration
between the numerical work to be performed in the
              PC
cluster and the experimental work to be performed in
the W. G. Pritchard
              Laboratories of the Department of
Mathematics. The new equipment will make it
              possible to
numerically simulate the various complex physical
phenomena
              observed in the fluid lab and will greatly
enhance collaborations among
              researchers in computational
and applied mathematics at Penn State. The PC
              cluster
will also be the basis for the creation of a new
computational
              laboratory, which together with the
Pritchard fluid lab, will provide a unique
              environment
for multidisciplinary research as well as for (both
undergraduate
              and graduate) student training.
