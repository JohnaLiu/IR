Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is directed
              toward the development of highly sensitive, solid-state, solar-blind
              photodiodes based on the group III-nitride material system, aluminum gallium
              nitride. Ultraviolet detectors are used in water treatment plants, automated
              arc-welding systems, and the monitoring of atmospheric ozone depletion. The
              objective of the proposed project is to develop tunable, high efficiency,
              Gallium Arsenide Nitride/ aluminum gallium nitride multiple quantum well UV
              photodiodes utilizing sequential resonant tunneling to enhance carrier
              collection efficiency and detector response time.

The multiple quantum well
              detectors will improve the characteristics of nitride detectors specifically in
              the solar blind wavelength region.   Significant commercial interest has been
              expressed in this wavelength region for flame detection, ultraviolet
              photolithography, space and military applications include missile detection.
