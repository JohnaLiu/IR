Abstract    :
              	This dissertation investigates how immigrants learn ideologies about the U. S.
              racial social structure.  Focus groups and in-depth interviews will explore how
              new immigrants perceive the racial hierarchy and how these perceptions compare
              with racial categories in their countries of origin.  Questions will focus
              especially on personal experiences and media exposure that have conveyed
              knowledge of the racial hierarchy.  A second set of issues will investigate how
              contact with this racial ideology has affected the immigrants' own racial
              identity, for instance, whether they have maintained specific national
              affiliations or developed more pan-ethnic identities.  These processes of
              acquiring racial knowledge and adopting new racial identities are bound up with
              immigrants' acceptance or rejection of racial ideology and the ideologies'
              characterizations of their own position in that hierarchy.  A variety of
              immigrant groups will be interviewed to investigate how past experiences and
              their position in the racial hierarchy influence acquisition and acceptance of
              racial ideologies.
