Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to
              design and construct a novel cell-based microfluidic platform for the discovery
              and development of therapeutic drugs. Utilizing state-of-the-art
              microfabrication techniques, micro-sensor and controller design, fluid handling
              and cell culturing techniques, the project seeks to address the shortcomings
              and bottlenecks of current biopharmaceutical drug discovery and development
              processes. The specific project objectives include the design and fabrication
              of micro-scale bioreactors for microbial and mammalian systems as well as the
              design and construction of a microfluidic cell culture media and gas handling
              system. These components will be integrated into a highly parallel and
              completely automated platform of cell culturing devices. These devices have the
              potential to introduce a new paradigm that would streamline the development of
              new cellular products for therapeutic applications.

The commercial
              applications of this project will be in the area of drug discovery and
              development. Automation and parallelization of the drug discovery process will
              allow for increased efficiency in drug time to market as well as offer the
              opportunity to extend research efforts to areas that had previously been
              limited by manpower constraints.
