Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to
              develop and validate augmentation strategies for micrometer scale laboratory
              tasks by using a prototype Augmented Micro-manipulation System (AMS) based on a
              cooperative robot. The AMS is applicable to a vast range of micrometer scale
              laboratory tasks including biomedical research ranging from tissue
              manipulation, to cell injection and other engineering laboratory tasks such as
              MEMS assembly. The AMS uses the cooperative paradigm (where the robot shares
              the control of the tool with the user) to allow easy integration of human
              intelligence, superior analytical abilities of a computer, and the precision of
              the robot to achieve better accuracy, and success in performing the selected
              task. The AMS complements the basic compliant motion of the robot with
              appropriate sensor-based augmentation strategies for efficiently performing
              different portions of the selected task. The AMS is a compact, flexible, and
              cost-effective system for performing common micrometer scale laboratory tasks.
              

The commercial application of this project is in the area of laboratory
              instrumentation linked to biomedical research.
