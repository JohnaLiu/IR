Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is to study the
              feasibility of a phytoremediation process to remove lead, a model metal,  from
              the soil. The approach is to increase the efficiency of chelate-assisted
              phytoremediation of environmental contaminants by using transgenic technology
              to provide plants with the ability to exude significant amounts of a specific
              chelating agent from their roots. Isolated from the DNA of the organism
              pseudomonas stutzeri, this chelating agent, pyridine-2,6-bis (thiocarboxylic
              acid) (ptdc), has the ability to degrade carbon tetrachloride and to attain
              high stability constants for most heavy metals, thereby assisting preferential
              plant uptake of these metals into harvestable leaves and stems. In this Phase I
              project, the pdtc transgene will be placed under the control of plant promoters
              to overexpress the gene in roots. ptdc excretion will  be explored in two model
              plants, tobacco and canola.

The commercial application of this project is in
              the area of environmental phytoremediation.
