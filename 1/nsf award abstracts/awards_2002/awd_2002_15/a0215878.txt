Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Prof. Peter
              C. Chen of Spelman College will develop a high resolution universal resonance
              Raman probe for studies in chemistry and materials science.  The probe, which
              would use nonlinear resonance Raman spectroscopy for the selective
              identification and studies of species, would be able to provide resonance Raman
              spectra over an exceptionally broad range of input wavelengths (220-1800 nm). 
              Furthermore, this instrument will be able to provide this information with very
              high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution.    

The universal resonance
              Raman probe will be useful for non-intrusive probing of challenging but
              important samples such as high temperature, highly reactive gas phase samples
              that may contain complex mixtures and interfering species.  Such challenging
              conditions are found in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and related processes
              for creating new high-tech materials.  Undergraduate students from groups that
              are underrepresented in the sciences (Spelman College is an historically black
              women's college) will help design, construct and test this new instrument on a
              CVD system.  These CVD experiments will be carried out in collaboration with
              scientists at Microcoating Technologies, a private company that specializes in
              combustion CVD.
