Abstract    :
              In the past few decades, R&D efforts have resulted in production of high
              performance materials, which are stronger and more durable than before. We have
              also learned that many deterioration processes in our structures involve
              deleterious chemical reactions, rate-controlled by ionic transport, which lead
              to degradation of the physical properties of the material. Developments in
              sensing technology in the past decade have enabled us to measure the physical
              damage caused by these chemical reactions. However, with a few exceptions,
              tools for real-time monitoring and evaluation of the chemical environment of
              the system from within are not available. Availability of this information will
              help optimize repair and replacement strategies, and it will lead to
              significant reductions in rehabilitation costs. 
Development of a family of
              fiber optic chemical sensors for real-time distributed monitoring of civil and
              mechanical systems is proposed. The proposed chemical sensor comprises an
              optical fiber with a sensitive fluorescent polymer cladding/coating, whose
              absorption and emission properties are altered by interaction with its
              environment. This interaction that leads to emission of specific wavelength by
              the target-specific fluorophore, provides a highly selective and sensitive
              process for distributed chemical sensing of chlorides, calcium, oxygen, pH and
              more.
