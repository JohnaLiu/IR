MRI/RUI:  Acquisition of Range-Scanning Equipment and of Data
              Servers for the Reconstruction of Large-Scale Scenes from 3D Range and 2D Color
              Data

This proposal, addressing the problem of 3D-photorealistic
              reconstruction of large-scale scenes in a tightly integrated system that
              features novel registration, segmentation, modeling, and visualization
              algorithms, tackles the following issues:

1) Nonplanar segmentation, 
2)
              Automatic registration between 3D and 2D data sets,
3) Integration of the data
              sets, and 
4) Simplification of the complex geometry.

The project requests
              the acquisition of a highly accurate range-scanner that can provide dense 3D
              data of outdoor scenes. Proposed is a system that operates on an input sequence
              of calibrated and uncalibrated 3D range and 2D image data. The system will
              segment the range and color images, extract their features, establish
              topological relationships between features, and derive global topological
              relationships between features in the final 3D geometric model. The whole
              process will be fully automated except for the range-to-image registration
              process that requires minimal user interaction. The expected output consists of
              a complete photorealistic model of the scene. The resulting 3D models will be
              utilized in geospatial; the acquired data will also be used for teaching
              purposes in CS and Geography departments. Aided by the Center of the Analysis
              and Research of Spatial Information (CARSI), urban areas of downtown New York
              and the interior of Grand Central Station in Manhattan are being used as
              testbeds.
