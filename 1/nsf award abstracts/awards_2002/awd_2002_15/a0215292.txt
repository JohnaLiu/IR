Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will provide an
              inexpensive, highly-scaleable process technology to create high-brightness,
              short wavelength, silicon-based LEDs (light emitting diodes) and laser diodes. 
              We will utilize a biological template technology, developed at the University
              of Colorado, combined with proprietary Astralux expertise to prepare an array
              of silicon nanoparticles (quantum dots) that will emit visible light.  In Phase
              I, we will demonstrate the feasibility of creating the device structure . This
              device will have the advantage of being compatible with on-chip silicon
              processing.  

These devices can be used in optical storage (such as
              read/write compact disks), printing applications (laser printers), full-color
              displays (laptop computer screens) and indicators (traffic lights), medical
              applications, and white light emitting diodes for replacing incandescent light
              bulbs.
