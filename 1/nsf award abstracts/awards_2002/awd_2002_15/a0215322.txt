Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at
              developing a micro optical switch array that implements the principle of
              electro-wetting-on-dielectric, a liquid micro-actuation mechanism based on the
              electrical control of surface tension on dielectric surfaces, for use in
              optical telecommunications and optical computing. While MOEMS devices move
              solid micro-mirrors, liquid actuation is attractive because of the compactness
              of the device and absence of the stiction problem inherent in solid-solid
              surface contact. Currently, a couple of companies use liquids for their optical
              devices. Compared with their liquid-based optical MEMS under development, which
              use thermal energy to move liquid, electrical control of surface tension (i.e.,
              electro-wetting) is especially promising because of its unprecedented energy
              efficiency (estimated ~10 W during switching with < 30 V) and reliability.
              Unlike other electro-wetting principles the proposed
              electro-wetting-on-dielectric driving promises high speed and long-term
              reliability, which are critical for commercial success. 

The
              electro-wetting-on-dielectric micro optical switch arrays will find use within
              any system requiring optical signal routing such as optical computers, optical
              instrumentation, distributed sensors, and medical monitoring.
