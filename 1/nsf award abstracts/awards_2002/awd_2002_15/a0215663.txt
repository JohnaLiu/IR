Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Saint John's University will acquire a liquid
              chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection, including atmospheric pressure
              chemical ionization and electrospray probes. This equipment will enhance
              research in a number of areas including a) isolation of bioactive natural
              products; b) quantification of pesticides and pesticide residues in the Sauk
              River watershed; c) analysis of biological mechanisms for drug resistance; d)
              modeling a trinuclear site in multicopper oxidases; e) oxidized LDL studies; f)
              DNA repair in Saccharomyces cerevisiae; g) identification of endothelial
              proteins involved in tight junction formation; and h) vitamin K status in
              female athletes.  

Liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection
              (LC-MS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the separation and analysis
              of complex mixtures.  It has become almost indispensable in industry;
              therefore, it will be crucial in the preparation of students for careers in
              industry or graduate school.  This instrument will also be used by students at
              the College of Saint Benedict (an all women's college) and students at Saint
              Cloud State University.
