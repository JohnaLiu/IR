Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the
University of Maryland,
              Baltimore County (UMBC) will
purchase a distributed memory parallel computer
              which
will be dedicated to the support of departmental
research in the
              mathematical sciences. The principal
investigators intend to purchase a
              64-processor Linux
cluster consisting of 32 dual-processor
              computational
nodes connected with a high-speed Myrinet network and
equipped
              with a significant amount of fast central disk
storage using a RAID
              controller. All researchers plan
to use the Message Passing Interface (MPI) to
              provide
reliable portability.

The equipment will be used for multiple
              research projects,
including, in particular, the areas of applications
              in
semiconductor manufacturing, quantum chemistry,
bioinformatics,
              computational neurobiology, and
constrained mechanical systems. The research
              projects are
unified by the need to use efficient parallel computing
to
              enable the solution of practically relevant problems.
The research areas
              addressed are of current national
interest and involve solution methodologies
              that cut
across these disciplines and will lead to more efficient
simulation
              techniques in other areas. The computer will
also play a role in the
              department's education mission,
the university's MARC U*STAR (Minority Access
              to Research
Careers) program, and in the principal investigators'
Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates activities, by
involving students at various
              levels in contemporary
methods in scientific computing.
