This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project
              proposes to test a method for conducting
high-throughput, automated analysis
              of the protein content of cell lines using a novel mass analyzed 2D
              liquid-phase separation technique. The conventional method of 2D PAGE
              (Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) has several limitations. It is labor
              intensive, time consuming, difficult to automate and often not readily
              reproducible. In addition, quantitation, especially in differential expression
              experiments, is often difficult and limited in dynamic range. The proposed
              technology provides automated, faster, and more accurate 2D protein maps, and
              can be used to purify specific proteins and enact protein/peptide digest and
              sequencing information. These capabilities will prove valuable for studying
              drug-protein interactions for detecting early signs of cancer. Studies of
              cancer cell lines can reveal signatures of cancerous cells that can serve as
              markers for actual diagnosis. The proposed system is based on 2D liquid-phase
              protein separation using chromatofocusing (CF) in one dimension and non-porous
              silica, reverse-phase, high-performance liquid chromatography (NPS-RP HPLC) in
              the second dimension. The HPLC eluent is monitored in real-time by on-line
              electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) to provide molecular
              weight and intensity information. 

The commercial application of this
              project is in the area of proteomics. This market  is forecasted to grow from
              $0.7 billion to $5.8 billion over the next 5 years. There is a tremendous need
              to develop automated methods of protein analysis of cell lines to better
              understand whole system biological function for improved drug therapy and early
              detection of disease, such as cancer.
