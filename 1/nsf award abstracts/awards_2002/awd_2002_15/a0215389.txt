Abstract    :
              The Center for Subsurface Modeling (CSM), part of the Texas
Institute for
              Computational and Applied Mathematics at The
University of Texas at Austin,
              will purchase 64 PCs, a
control workstation, as well as a storage device, in
              order
to constuct a parallel computing platform capable of
100 Gflops.  The
              network for the cluster (high speed Myrinet
network (1Gbit) and a 100Mb
              ethernet network) is already in
place.  This platform will be dedicated to
              research in the
mathematical sciences being led by CSM.  Projects that
              will
use this platform include large-scale multiphysics modeling
of
              subsurface processes, multiscale modeling of flow in
extremely heterogeneous
              rocks, finite element coastal and
ocean modeling, parallel terascale iterative
              solvers, and
Discontinuous Galerkin discretization methods. A
              substantial
component of each of these projects is the development of
new
              scalable parallel algorithms as well as implementation
and testing of both
              proof-of-concept as well as of
production-quality codes for simulation of
              cases driven by
energy and environment applications.  A
              dedicated
limited-access resource greatly expedites such development.

The
              Center for Subsurface Modeling, part of the Texas
Institute for Computational
              and Applied Mathematics at The
University of Texas at Austin, will purchase
              equipment needed
to construct a medium size parallel computer capable of
100
              billion arithmetic operations per second.  This computer
will be dedicated to
              research in the mathematical and
computational sciences being led by CSM. 
              Researchers
involved in the project have decades of experience in
development
              of robust, accurate and fast computational
techniques. The new cluster will
              allow for large-scale
computational modeling and testing of such techniques
              which
promise to improve ability to understand, predict, monitor,
and control
              natural and engineered processes occuring in
surface and subsurface.
              Significant examples include
optimization of oil and gas recovery, analysis
              of
contamination and remediation scenarios in subsurface and
surface waters
              like aquifer and coastal environments. The
access to a dedicated computing
              resource will
greatly expedite such development.
