Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
              accurate measurement of the composition and microphysics of atmospheric
              aerosols that have significant implications for global and regulatory
              environmental issues. This project would replace the quadrupole
              mass-spectrometer (QMS) with a compact time-of-flight mass spectrometer
              (TOFMS). This would enable the measurement of complete chemical composition on
              a particle by particle basis. Key to this is the electronic and data
              acquisition system, which will make semi-continuous TOFMS practical
              computationally. The Phase I project will lead to the construction of a
              prototype instrument that will have unique capabilities for real time
              monitoring of ambient aerosol chemistry and microphysics. Moreover, the
              coupling of high efficiency EI to the compact TOFMS will have many other
              potential mass spectrometric applications.
The commercial market for the
              existing aerosol mass spectrometer includes government and educational research
              labs, and may expand to include regulatory monitoring efforts and process
              industrial laboratories.
