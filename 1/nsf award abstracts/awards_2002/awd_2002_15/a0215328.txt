Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
              define methodology to facilitate the growth of engineered cartilage tissue.
              Recent studies have demonstrated that the alginate recovered chondrocyte (ARC)
              method can be used to stimulate isolated adult articular chondrocytes in vitro
              to form viable cartilaginous tissue with good physicochemical properties. The
              innovation of this work is that it describes for the first time a method in
              which the cells from articular cartilage from skeletally mature animals can be
              used to form engineered tissues in vitro. The overall hypothesis of the
              proposed project is that tissue, engineered using the ARC method, can be used
              for long-term repair of full thickness cartilage defects. Initial experiments
              have shown promise in producing ARC tissue as both an allograft (from a donor)
              and an autograft (from self). The purpose of this proposal is to advance
              current ARC technology for use as an autograft procedure to repair full
              thickness cartilage defects in swine. At various times before and after
              transplantation, the biochemical composition, histological appearance and
              functional properties will be assessed and related to one another. The data
              will help determine the feasibility of using the ARC method for the repair of
              injured or diseased cartilage tissue.

The commercial application of this
              project is in the area of articular cartilage repair The incidence of articular
              cartilage injury is estimated to be approximately 27,200 cases per year. The
              proposed research will lead to a commercial method for production of tissue for
              surgical implantation to repair articular cartilage defects.
