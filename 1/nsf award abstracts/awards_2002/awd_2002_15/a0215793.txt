This project will produce a new coronagraph
              system to extend the well-understood and tested techniques of the classical
              coronagraph at the 3.67 meter Advanced Electro-Optical System (AEOS) telescope
              of the United States Air Force observatory at Haleakela, Maui, Hawaii. AEOS is
              equipped with a very high order (960 elements) adaptive optics unit to correct
              for atmospheric turbulence.  The AEOS adaptive optics unit dramatically
              surpreses the seeing halo between radii of 0.2 and 1.5 arcseconds at a
              wavelength of 1.6 micrometers.  It is within this region of the spatial
              information domain that enables compelling scientific analysis for the nearby
              vicinities of brown dwarfs, super-Jupiter planets, extra-solar system zodiacal
              dust disks.  This instrumentation development establishes a new instrumentation
              program to provide graduate students in New York City to peruse
              instrumentation-based research programs.  Undergraduates from an all-women
              college in New York will participate.
