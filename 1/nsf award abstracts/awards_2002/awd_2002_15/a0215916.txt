Recently, two ground-breaking sets of observations
              -discoveries of continuum radiation from protogalaxies in the millimeter and
              submillimeter wavelength range, and the development of the largest catalog to
              date of galaxy clusters exhibiting the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect -have set the
              stage for advanced studies of galaxy and cluster evolution by a suite of
              continuum cameras on the US/Mexico Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT), currently
              under construction.   To ensure immediate scientific payoff from the LMT, this
              award will contribute to funding the construction of a copy of BOLOCAM -an
              existing, wide format (144 pixel) bolometer camera developed for the Caltech
              Submillimeter Observatory.  This camera, called BOLOCAM II, will be the
              flagship continuum array receiver in the early years of the LMT, and will be
              essential for telescope commissioning as well as early science results.
