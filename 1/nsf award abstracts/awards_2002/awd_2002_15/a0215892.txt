Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Kennesaw State University  will
              acquire a UV-VIS scanning spectrometer.  Research will focus on the following
              studies: a) synthesis and characterization of novel monodisperse
              oligo(p-phenylene vinylene)s as models for poly(p-phenylene vinylene)s; and b)
              quantification of polymeric aluminum in water treatment coagulants. 
              

Scanning UV-VIS spectroscopy is a workhouse in a modern chemical
              laboratory.  It is critical for the study of chemical reactions, as it enables
              the detection of ultraviolet or visible light-absorbing molecules.  These
              studies will have an impact in a variety of areas, especially environmental
              sciences and materials chemistry.
