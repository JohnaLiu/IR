Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will test the
              feasibility of new drug delivery applications arising from Advanced
              Encapsulation's patented method of lipid membrane encapsulation. This passive
              method has demonstrated the ability to encapsulate nearly any object of
              colloidal dimensions at relatively high yield under gentle conditions.
              Specifically, no other technique has been reported which encapsulates interior
              vesicles intact and having a composition distinct from the outer membrane.
              Cationic vesicles and iron oxide nanoparticles are all known to have poor
              compatibility with blood environments resulting in rapid aggregation and/or
              clearance. However, these materials have shown great promise in vitro for
              various biomedical applications including medical imaging, controlled release,
              and localized delivery via magnetic fields. This project will test the
              encapsulation and separation efficiency as well as the stability of these
              materials in bovine serum and/or plasma. Based on the successes of liposomes in
              intravenous drug delivery, and on the physics of macromolecular interactions,
              liposomal encapsulation should engender biocompatibility to both classes of
              materials in question.

The commercial applications of this project are in
              the area of pharmaceutical drug delivery.
