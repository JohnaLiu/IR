Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Tulane
              University will acquire a growth/preparation apparatus for nanoscale and
              materials science.  The new setup will combine a plasma source for non-invasive
              surface cleaning with thin film deposition equipment (physical vapor
              deposition, plasma-assisted vapor deposition, pulsed laser deposition) and
              basic in-situ characterization facilities (RHEED and XPS).  The primary users
              will be researchers from Tulane University and Xavier University of Louisiana. 
              

This apparatus will be used for the synthesis of a wide variety of magnetic
              catalytic, biocompatible, nanoscopic and structural materials, and will play a
              key role in integrating Tulane's and Xavier's materials synthesis and advanced
              surface characterization programs.  It will also enhance instruction through
              research training of undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate students;
              through implementation in several courses; and as a hands-on component in
              outreach programs.
