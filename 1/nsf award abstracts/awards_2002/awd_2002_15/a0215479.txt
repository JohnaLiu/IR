Abstract    :
              The detection of gravitational waves will require detectors with great
              sensitivity that can be maintained over many years of observation.  Long
              observing times will be needed to catch those few rare and ephemeral bursts of
              gravitational waves expected from a gravitational collapse.

The ALLEGRO
              detector at Louisiana State University has the best record in the world for
              long time operation at its best sensitivity; it has been in continuous
              operation for 4 of the past 5 years, as the only U.S. member of the
              International Gravitational Event Collaboration (IGEC).

The sensitivity of
              ALLEGRO will be upgraded, to roughly match the improvements underway elsewhere
              in the IGEC.  ALLEGRO will run for extended periods of time over the next three
              years, until the cryogenic bar technology is fully eclipsed by full time
              operation of the new interferometric detectors of the LIGO project.

Two
              unique experiments in collaboration with LIGO, enabled by the close physical
              proximity of the two detectors, will be performed.  One is a search for burst
              events which uses the negligible wave travel time to good advantage, and the
              other is a search for a random omnipresent gravitational wave background left
              over from big bang.
