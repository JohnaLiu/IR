Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at McMurry University  will upgrade their CW proton NMR
              Spectrometer to proton/C-13 Fourier Transform NMR.  This equipment will
              facilitate enzyme binding site activation studies and natural products
              chemistry research.   This upgrade will also enable much faster scan times, and
              therefore allow classroom use.  

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. 
              Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas, especially biochemistry.
