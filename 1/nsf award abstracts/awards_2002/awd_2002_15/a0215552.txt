Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims to develop a
              step-out technology for paraffin alkylation to produce high-octane clean
              gasoline. Conventional alkylation processes require large volumes of corrosive
              liquid acids, which can inflict serious injury via skin contact or inhalation.
              The new alkylation process will be fundamentally safer and cleaner, reducing
              the use and generation of toxic chemicals. It uses a first-of-a-kind engineered
              zeolite catalyst that is environmentally benign and eliminates the risks
              associated with liquid acids while producing alkylate of comparable quality.
              The new catalyst promises significantly improved yields and selectivities,
              minimizing waste by-products and disposal problems associated with liquid
              acids. 

The engineered zeolite catalysts can be used most effectively for
              liquid phase alkylations of paraffins and aromatics, such as the production of
              high-octane alkylate, and industrially important petrochemicals such as cumene
              and ethylbenzene.
