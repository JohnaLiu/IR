Abstract    :
              For this interdisciplinary grant in the mathematical sciences, Grant will spend
              August 2003-July 2004 visiting the Department of Electrical and Computer
              Engineering at the University of Colorado at
Boulder to collaborate with their
              research group in digital communications.

The primary goal is to design
              modulation techniques for systems with multiple transmit antennas. This
              modulation is also referred to as space-time coding, and requires the
              production of sets of complex matrices
which achieve maximal spatial diversity
              (that is, the difference of any of these matrices has maximal rank). The
              entries of these matrices are constrained to be so-called constellation points
              for the modulation scheme.

Grant hopes to build upon recent work of those
              who have used algebraic number theory to build sets of matrices with maximal
              spatial diversity whose entries are in constellations for BPSK, QPSK, and
              rectangular QAM modulation schemes, and to apply algebraic number theory to the
              design of
space-time codes for other constellations.

This IGMS project is
              jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and
              the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
