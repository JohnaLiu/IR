Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will explore high
              efficient, long lifetime and inexpensive light emitting diodes (LEDs) based on
              semiconductor nanocrystals. The fabrication technology of the semiconductor
              nanocrystal LEDs is very much similar to the one used for the fabrication of
              polymer LEDs for commercial purposes. As a result, the commercial potential of
              the nanocrystal LEDs relays mainly on the optical quality of the nanocrystals.
              This project design adopts two recent technologies, which yields semiconductor
              nanocrystals with extremely high emission efficiency and exceptional chemical
              and thermal stability. The dendron ligand technology provides nanocrystals with
              exceptional stability against the chemical processing and the thermal effect in
              the operation of the devices. The nanocrystals synthesized using the bright
              point concept produces unprecedented optical quality, about 80 percent
              photoluminescence quantum yield, 23-27 nm emission full peak width at half
              maximum, and tunable emission window from 450-700 nm. With those high optical
              quality and highly processable semiconductor nanocrystals, it is possible that
              a new generation of semiconductor nanocrystal LEDs, which have at least
              compatible performance to the polymer LEDs, but with low cost and continuous
              tunable and narrow emission profile.

The commercial potential of the polymer
              LEDs and nanocrystal LEDs will highly depend on the lifetime and the cost of
              the devices. Nanocrystal LEDs possess nearly all of the advantages of polymer
              LEDs, but with significantly more tunable and narrow emission profile. At this
              stage, the commercial standard for the lifetime of the polymer LEDs is around
              several thousand hours. The commercial goal this project is to boost the
              performance of the nanocrystal LEDs to at least the level of that of polymer
              LEDs. The usage of those devices is on portable electronic devices, such as
              portable computer and cellular telephone.
