Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Yale University will acquire an Electron
              Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectrometer.  The new instrument will support the
              research of major users in the Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, and Molecular
              Biophysics and Biochemistry Departments.  Some of the studies that will exploit
              this instrument include a) EPR studies of photosystem II and Mn model
              complexes; b) site directed spin labeling studies of protein secondary
              structure; c) de novo design of metal ion binding sites in proteins; d)
              bioinorganic studies of actIV cyclase and transition metal uptake; e)
              characterization of metal oxide catalysts; and f) EPR studies of RNase P. 
              

An electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer is an instrument used
              to obtain information about the molecular and electronic structure of
              molecules. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of
              free radicals which are often essential for the initiation of tumor growth
              and/or a variety of chemical reactions.  These studies will have an impact in a
              number of areas, in particular biological chemistry.
