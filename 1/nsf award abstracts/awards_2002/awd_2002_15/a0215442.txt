ABSTRACT

Computational Equipment for Approximation Theory,
              Control
Theory, and Graph Theory

The Department of Mathematics at
              Vanderbilt University will
purchase computer equipment dedicated to supporting
              research
in the mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for
several
              research projects, as follows.  Professor Ellingham
will investigate
              conjectures in graph theory involving
surface embeddings, traversability, and
              independent sets.
Professor Hardin will construct and develop applications
of
              local orthogonal bases. Professor Horn will investigate
the controllability of
              linked elastic structurres using
numerical methods. Professors Hardin and Saff
              will
investigate discrete minimum energy problems on the sphere.
Professors
              Saff and Schumaker will research the theory and
applications of splines,
              especially on the sphere.

Professor Ellingham's research involves graphs,
              which are
mathematical models of networks. Communication,
transportation and
              other networks are often modeled using
techniques from graph theory. 
              Professor Hardin's research
involves wavelets, which are an important tool
              for
compressing images, sounds, and other real-world information.
They may be
              applied to problems in fitting equations to data
points in any area of
              science, or processing images, for
example from medical scanning equipment.
              Professor Horn's
research involves control theory, which allows
              computation
of how forces should be applied to a complicated system
              to
achieve a desired outcome.  There are applications to many
real-world
              structures such as trusses, robot arms, solar
panels, and suspension bridges.
              The work by Professors
Hardin and Saff involves the best way to place points
              on
a sphere so that the sphere is covered as uniformly as
possible. This
              problem has applications in many fields,
including the structure of viruses,
              crystallography,
structure of molecules, and electrostatics.  The research
by
              Professors Saff and Schumaker involves trying to provide
accurate but easily
              computable representations of quantities
on the surface of a sphere. For
              example, these technique may
be used to construct an accurate model of the
              Earth's
gravitational field.
