Abstract    :
              DNA segregation is a fundamental process that is poorly understood in bacteria. 
              Recent work shows that E. coli plasmids are targeted to specific regions within
              the cell, rather than being randomly distributed in the cytoplasm as long
              thought.  Multicopy plasmids form clusters that are targeted to the cell
              midpoint where they are duplicated.  Following duplication, plasmids migrate
              with rapid kinetics from midcell to the future midpoints of the nascent
              daughter cells.  Little is known about the mechanisms underlying plasmid
              localization or movement in bacteria.  While a set of par genes important for
              DNA partitioning have been identified, how they contribute to plasmid
              localization is not understood.  The goal of this study is to identify genes
              encoded by plasmids and their hosts that are directly responsible for mediating
              plasmid targeting, clustering and movement.  Since bacterial DNA segregation is
              a fundamental process about which so little is currently known, the impact of
              this study will be extraordinarily broad, potentially affecting any area of
              research where bacteria are involved.   

Some areas that will be impacted
              include microbial ecology and evolution, pathogenesis, genetics, genomics, and
              bioremediation.  For example, understanding the details of DNA segregation
              could contribute directly to the development of new antibiotics designed to
              inhibit the process.  Since one of the plasmids used here is a broad host range
              antibiotic resistance determinant, these studies will also impact our
              understanding on the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance.  This work
              will also have a significant impact on undergraduate education by contributing
              to the training of students in the biological sciences.
