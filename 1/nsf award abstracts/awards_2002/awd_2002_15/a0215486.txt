Abstract    :
              This project will provide computing support for
research on computationally
              intensive applied
statistical methods: wavelet methods for finding
filiments
              in two and three dimensional data,
microarray data analysis of gene expression
              data,
Monte Carlo method of finding interpretable
approximations to black box
              functions,
spatial smoothing of functional MRI images,
and automatic
              clustering of flow cytometry data.

The research frontiers of statistics are
              now a
far cry from the t-tests and chi-squared tests of
introductory courses.
               Modern scientific equipment
gathers millions of data measurements in
              complex
settings.  For example, biologists measure the
expression levels of
              thousands of genes on a single
chip, and brain scientists watch maps of
              brain
activity as a subject performs a task.  Handling
data from these and
              related problems requires new
statistical methods to sort out patterns
              from
randomness.  These methods in turn require
substantial computating
              power, in both speed and
memory. This project will pay for
              computating
resources to support five such research areas.
