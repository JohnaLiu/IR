Abstract    :
              This award supports a research consortium (workshop) of promising doctoral
              students and distinguished research faculty in the field of human-computer
              interaction. The consortium will be held in conjunction with the ACM 2002
              Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2002) in Minneapolis,
              Minnesota, sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special
              Interest Group on Human Computer Interaction (SIGCHI). The goals of the
              workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have
              a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new
              researchers by having experts in the research field give them advice, and
              making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their
              research conference. Student participants will make formal presentations of
              their work during the workshop, and will receive feedback from the faculty
              panel. The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how
              their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research,
              whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects,
              whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their
              results are appropriately analyzed and presented. Student participants will
              also present their work during the technical program of the CHI 2002
              conference. Extended abstracts of the students' work will be disseminated via
              publication in the CHI 2002 Extended Abstracts, which has wide print and
              electronic distribution. Evaluation of the consortium will be conducted by ACM
              SIGCHI's conference management committee, and results of the evaluation will be
              available to the organizers of future consortia.

Human-Computer Interaction
              is a multidisciplinary field of increasing importance to science, commerce, and
              society.  This workshop contributes to the professional development of young
              scientists, whose professional careers will be devoted to understanding how
              computer systems and software can be designed to serve the needs of users.
