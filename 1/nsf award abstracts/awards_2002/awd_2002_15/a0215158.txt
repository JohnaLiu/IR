Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop
              remote radio frequency (RF) measurements for critical monitoring of fuel
              pipelines for failures.  This novel application of RF measurements uses the
              pipe as a RF transmission line, and antennas launch radar pulses that travel
              inside the pipe, without disturbing the transported fluid.  Pulses reflect-off
              obstructions/breaches in the pipe and are measured by distributed low-cost GPS
              receivers to locate the fault.

The outcome of this research will lead to a
              marketable product, which when implemented by pipeline corporations, can save
              millions of dollars annually in pipeline spills and advert potential loss of
              life and property.  Further, the development of this technology supports the
              current US homeland security initiative to protect valuable assets against
              overt acts of vandalism and/or terrorism.
