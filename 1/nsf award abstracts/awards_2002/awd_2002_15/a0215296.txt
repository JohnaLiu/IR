Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will investigate
              self-imaging in fiber structures, and determine feasibility of developing two
              classes of novel device: highly efficient, near diffraction-limited rare earth
              ion-doped glass lasers and amplifiers, and high power/energy fibers for 
              transport, routing and coupling of diffraction-limited beams. Conventional
              single mode fiber lasers can deliver similar performance at low power/ energy,
              but higher power systems require larger fiber apertures, leading to multi
              spatial mode propagation.  Self-imaging accesses a new operating regime for
              guided wave devices, enabling diffraction-limited power scaling of lasers and
              beam-transport fibers. In comparison, bulk lasers are less efficient, and more
              susceptible to thermo-optic distortions. The self-imaging proof-of-concept has
              been demonstrated in a 16W planar waveguide laser fabricated from
              diffusion-bonded crystals. However, that approach is not well suited to
              fabricating 2-dimensional waveguides where 4 separate polishing/bonding steps
              are needed. 

Application of this work would be the design and development of
              optimized waveguides for the telecommunications industry.  The end product
              would be an integrated product with improved optical characteristics.
