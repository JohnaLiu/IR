MRI/RUI Acquisition of
              Computing and Peripheral Hardware to Support Collaborative Research and
              Research Education in Imaging and Information Visualization

This proposal
              from a RUI institution, developing an Ethernet-Based imaging and visualization
              infrastructure, supports interdisciplinary research projects that span a
              variety of application areas such as Information Visualization, Imaging
              Science, Color Analysis, Time-Varying Images, and Real-Time Image Processing.
              The laboratory, consisting of one server, multiple workstations, associated
              cameras, frame grabbers, output devices, and selected network and image
              processing software, will be bridged to existing departmental, college, and
              campus networks, and will be used to accomplish the following goals:
   Expand
              research investigations advancing image processing and information
              visualization,
   Encourage interdisciplinary research, research training, and
              educational activities,
   Increase industrial collaboration adding a real
              world problem environment,
   Support graduate and undergraduate instruction
              in related courses such as Pattern Recognition, Computer     Graphics, and
              Digital Imaging, and
   Attract women and minority groups at both graduate and
              undergraduate levels to pursue research projects.
The infrastructure will
              service the following projects within three research groups:
1.   Information
              Visualization and Data Mining Group
A. Visual Exploration and Mining of Large
              Relational Datasets
B. Algorithm Visualization
C. Interactive Document
              Management
D. Visualization of Association Rules
2.    Image Visualization,
              Color Measurement, and Color Analysis Group
A. Color Reproduction in Digital
              Imaging
B.  Fundamental Analysis of CCD Imaging Systems Using Fourier
              Theory
3.    Real-Time Image Processing and Pattern Recognition Group
A.
              Utilizing Wavelets for Target Tracking
B. An Integrated Image Analysis
              Algorithm from Dynamic Scenes
C. Confocal Microscopy and Image Analysis in
              Gamma-Ray Astronomy
D. Wireless Vision for Intelligent Transportation
              System
E. Pavement Surface Image Analysis System
