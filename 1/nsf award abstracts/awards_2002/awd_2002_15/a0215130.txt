Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
              establish the feasibility of engineering broad-spectrum disease resistance in
              crops. Pathogens cause enormous world-wide annual losses in crop yield. Prior
              research has shown that constitutive activation of the transcription factor
              AtERF1 confers resistance to several fungal pathogens in the model plant
              Arabidopsis thaliana. This Phase I project has three major goals : (1) To test
              additional Arabidopsis lines constitutively expressing AtERF1 and correlate
              AtERF1 expression levels with resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens ;
              (2) To determine if constitutive expression of AtERF1 is detrimental to
              Arabidopsis plants, and (3) to identify  transcription factors that are
              functionally analogous to AtERF1 in a number of crop species, including canola,
              tomato, rice and maize. The results of Phase I research are expected to
              indicate the technical feasibility of using AtERF1 to engineer enhanced
              pathogen resistance without adversely affecting other important agronomic
              properties of plants. 

The commercial application of this project is in the
              field of agriculture.
