Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Connecticut College will acquire a powder X-ray
              diffractometer for undergraduate research and research training. This equipment
              will enhance research studies involving the chemistry of microporous manganese
              oxides with layered and tunneled structures.  These manganese oxide projects
              include a) nonaqueous sol-gel syntheses of layered and tunneled materials; b)
              sol-gel preparation of thin films; c) sol-gel preparation of aerogels; d) room
              temperature synthesis of manganese oxide colloids as precursors to layered
              materials with a wide variety of interlayer cations; e) solventothermal
              reactions of colloidal materials; f) electrochemical studies of colloidal
              films; and g) control of Mn valency in colloids.  Faculty will also implement
              X-ray diffraction experiments in upper level laboratory courses.  

The X-ray
              diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three
              dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and
              it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule
              relative to the neighboring molecules.  These studies will have a strong impact
              in materials chemistry.
