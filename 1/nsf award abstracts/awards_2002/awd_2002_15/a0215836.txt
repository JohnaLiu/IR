MRI/RUI:  Acquisition of Wireless, Beowulf, and
              Distributed Computing Clusters

This proposal from an REU institution,
              establishing a parallel and distributed computing research laboratory for CS
              faculty and students, includes 
  An ad hoc mobile network cluster (handheld
              PDA and labtops connecting without a server),
  A Beowulf cluster ( a parallel
              computing cluster composed of off-the-shelf PCs with fast network connections
              between them), and
  Workstations connected in typical network style.
With
              specific research activities that follow, the clusters will support the
              following areas:
A.  Parallel and Distributed Computation on Ad Hoc
              Networks
1.  Development of a serverless location protocol
2.  Development of
              parallel applications for ad hoc networks on top of serverless SLP, and
3. 
              Utilizing idle cycles of wireless devices
B.  Parallel Algorithms for Graphs
              Coloring and Applications
1.  Graph coloring heuristics
2.  Historical study
              of the four-color theorem
C.  Parallel Genetic Algorithms (an optimization
              techniques based on the idea of "survival of the fittest")
D.  Language
              Support for Distributed Computing over Heterogeneous Networks 
(support for
              distributed data structures in High Performance C++)
E.  Distributed Database
              Systems
F.  Distributed Virtual Shared Memory Architectures
G.  High-Energy
              Astrophysics
H.  Dynamics of complex systems
Depending on the configuration
              needed for a particular application, the three clusters will be combined into
              one heterogeneous distributed network or used as stand-alone
              parallel/distributed networks.
