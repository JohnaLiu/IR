Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is structured
              around the design,
synthesis of new organic electroluminescent (OEL)
              materials, and their innovative
applications in fabricating frozen-junction
              polymer light-emitting electrochemical cells
(LECs) - an alternative to
              organic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) displays. Reveo has
identified the OEL
              display as the most promising display technology of the future and
              the
solution that best meets the new demands for bright, portable displays.
              These bright,
thin displays will eventually replace expensive flat panel
              liquid crystal displays (LCDs),
but they have not yet seen huge commercial
              success because of the poor OEL materials and
non-optimized device fabrication
              techniques. The mission of this program is therefore to
develop, optimize, and
              commercialize new OEL materials and devices that will make OEL
displays the
              new market standard in the multi-billion dollar display market. 
     LECs
              fabricated with these new materials are predicted to have high
              luminescence
efficiency, high brightness, and longer lifetime compared with
              current OEL displays. The
new materials thus have excellent commercial
              potential as the enabling technology behind
the next generation of full-color,
              low-cost, flat panel OEL displays.
