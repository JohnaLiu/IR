Abstract    :
              


This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to
              develop grafted tomato transplants for greenhouse and field applications in the
              USA. Genetic-based sources of resistance to soil-borne pathogens and pests are
              currently being used as the rootstocks for grafted tomatoes in Southern Europe,
              Asia and Australia. In these countries, vegetable production is being impacted
              by the elimination of methyl bromide. Biological control strategies, such as
              grafting, will have increasing value in the USA as disease profiles and
              chemical pesticide regulations change. This research will  demonstrate the
              production of high quality greenhouse bench grafts using rootstocks with
              disease resistance. 

The commercial applications of this project are in the
              field of agriculture.
