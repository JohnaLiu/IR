Abstract    :
              This award provides support to establish a COSEE West in the greater Los Angeles
              area with a diverse mix of activities aimed at 1) enhancing regional awareness
              of ocean sciences, 2) using ocean science as a vehicle to increase general
              science literacy and 3) increasing the number of students who choose science
              and ocean science careers.    These goals will be addressed by through
              catalytic, multi-faceted collaboration between the University of Southern
              California and the University of California at Los Angeles with additional
              links to the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History and the greater Los
              Angeles school districts.    A distance learning partnership will be
              established with the College of Exploration in Virginia.   Activities will
              include an extensive professional development and leadership program for
              science teachers, a community lecture series, an ocean science web site,  a
              college mentorship program and curriculum development activities.  

COSEE
              West has the potential to enhance science education in a densely populated and
              diverse major urban area.   The program conveys a focused vision and a set of
              interesting plans for incorporating ocean scientists and their research results
              into classrooms, informal education activities and public outreach.    Because
              of its focus on the LA basin, this COSEE Center has the potential to have a
              major impact on science education in school districts within the greater Los
              Angeles area.
