Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Denison University  will acquire a 400 MHz Fourier
              Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) Spectrometer. This equipment will
              enable researchers to carry out studies on a) probing dynamics in
              macromolecules using coupled spin relaxation; b) synthesis and characterization
              of methylene bridge substituted calix[4]arenes; c) studies of the reactivity
              and stereochemistry of protonated cyclopropanes in terpenoid rearrangements;
              and d) NMR studies of nearest neighbor effects on chemical shifts in peptides
              and studies of chemically modified proteins.   

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. 
              Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier research.  In addition to research involving
              undergraduate students, this instrument will be used in a number of advanced
              undergraduate laboratory courses at Denison University.
