Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project involves the
              development of photoluminescent phosphors and coating materials for ultraviolet
              light emitting diodes that will make possible a white light emitting diode
              having high color purity, efficiency and lifetime far exceeding those of
              current state of the art. The white light emitting diode light will be produced
              by down-converting the ultraviolet amplitude emission from light emitting
              diodes using an efficient mixture of several photo-luminescent phosphors. The
              materials will be optically coupled to light emitting diode dies using a newly
              developed selective deposition process (electrophoretic) that is currently
              being patented jointly by PhosphorTech and Agilent Technologies.  Improved
              solid state & phosphor material technologies are expected to result in dramatic
              changes in the lighting industry over the next several years. 
     This new
              white light source would change the way we live, and the way we consume energy.
               The worldwide amount of electricity consumed by lighting would decrease by
              more than 50%, and total worldwide consumption of electricity would decrease by
              more than 10%. The global savings would be more than 1,000TWh/yr of electricity
              at a value of about US$100B/year, along with the approximately 200 million tons
              of carbon emissions created during the generation of that electricity.
              Moreover, more than 125GW of electrical generating capacity would be freed for
              other uses or would not need to be created, a savings of over US$50B of
              construction cost. Finally, the impact on the environment will be dramatic,
              resulting in the elimination of one of the main sources of mercury pollution
