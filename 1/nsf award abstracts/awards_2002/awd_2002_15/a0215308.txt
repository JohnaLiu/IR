Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop  a
              novel membrane protein expression system using hyperthermophilic bacteria that
              are capable of synthesizing a vast amount of membrane proteins and supporting
              extensive internal membrane structures. Membrane proteins are of significant
              medicinal value. However, efforts to study membrane proteins are often hampered
              by their low level of biosynthesis. An efficient membrane protein
              overexpression system will facilitate the biochemical and biophysical
              characterization of such proteins. In this project,  self-replicating
              expression vectors, genome integrative vectors and mini-viral genome vectors
              will be constructed and explored for the expression of hyperthermophilic
              membrane proteins. To establish the general applicability of the system, the
              expression of various membrane proteins of different size, structure, and
              function will be examined. The system, once properly developed, will allow the
              economical mass production of hyperthermophilic membrane proteins essential for
              large-scale structural genomics effort as well as for specific industrial
              applications.

The commercial applications of this project are in the area of
              Structural Genomics Research.
