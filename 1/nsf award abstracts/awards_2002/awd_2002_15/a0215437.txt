The Consortium for Oceanographic
              Research and Education (CORE) will provide coordination, communication,
              evaluation and strategic planning services to the Centers for Ocean Science
              Education Excellence network.    Central Coordinating Office activities
              supported by this award will include a series of network PI and outreach
              meetings to build community consensus and enhance communications between
              Centers.     The COSEE CCO will also conduct an annual 'value-added'  workshop
              on a topic of concern to the network.   Topics will include program and network
              evaluation and assessment as well as the development of an overall strategic
              plan for COSEE.   In addition, the CCO will handle the recruitment and
              organization of an appropriate national advisory group for the network. The
              office's functions will also encompass outreach to non-COSEE educators and
              scientists as well as agencies and institutions with an interest in ocean
              science education. A COSEE network website will be established in conjunction
              with the Bridge website.   Subcontractors include the Office of Program
              Evaluation at the University of South Carolina (evaluation) and the Virginia
              Institute of Marine Science (website development).
