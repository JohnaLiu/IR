This award supports a collaborative research project between
              Professor Ellen Wohl of Colorado State University and Professor Timothy Davies
              of Lincoln University in Canterbury, New Zealand.  While mountainous regions
              provide the major water source for many regions and produce a
              disproportionately large amount of the global sediment budget, we know
              relatively little about the basic processes operating along mountain river
              channels.  This project will investigate mountain rivers to understand
              relationships between potential control variables (valley gradient, discharge,
              bedrock substrate resistance, and local sediment supply) and response variables
              (channel geometry and flow hydraulics).  The study will be conducted on the
              northwest side of the South Island of New Zealand where mountainous catchments
              remain largely unimpacted by human activities.  Knowledge gained should help in
              developing effective management schemes for mountain drainage basins.  This
              project will benefit from the expertise and facilities of both the U.S. and
              Australian institutions, and will include the active participation of American
              students in the international collaboration.
