This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project
              proposes to develop alternative biofilm control products for preventing biofilm
              accumulation on  a wide range of household, industrial, and medically relevant
              surfaces. Biofilm formation in industrial water systems leads to poor system
              performance, to accelerated biocorrosion, and to increased maintenance expense.
              Microbial colonization of food processing equipment and medical devices poses a
              serious health threat when biofilms harbor pathogenic organisms. Toxic
              biocides, even at high concentrations, often fail to control problematic
              biofilms. The efficacy of traditional antimicrobial agents would be greatly
              improved if used in conjunction with biofilm degrading enzymes. This Phase I
              project  will identify promising biofilm matrix- hydrolyzing enzyme candidates.
              The follow on Phase II project will develop enzyme products that are stable in
              the presence of chemical biocides and a variety of  adverse reaction
              conditions. These enzyme formulations will eventually be tested against
              mixed-species biofilms.

The commercial applications of this project are in a
              number of  areas, including  water distribution systems, food processing
              equipment, industrial machinery and medical devices.
