Abstract    :
              This Major Research Instrumentation award to Woods Hole Oceanographic
              Institution in Massachusetts provides funds for acquisition of a fast-scan,
              high resolution, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer with laser
              ablation capability.  The instrument will be operated as part of a new Marine
              Research Facility, which will emphasize fisheries, climate and oceanographic
              research using trace element and isotopic analysis of calcified structures,
              such as fish otoliths, mollusc shells, foraminiferal tests, and sponge and
              coral skeletons.  The project is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at
              NSF. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will provide cost-share support from
              non-federal funds for 30% of total project costs.
