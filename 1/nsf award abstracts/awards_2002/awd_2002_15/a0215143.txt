Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is focused on the
              development of highly stable and sensitive metal oxide semiconductor sensors
              for high-temperature applications. Currently available semiconductor sensors
              are typically restricted to the 200 C to 500 C range in order to have adequate
              response times and the necessary selectivity. In order to operate in the 600 C
              to 900 C range, stability of the porous sensing materials has to be enhanced in
              order to have a fast responding, sensitive sensor. In the project, the unique
              nanocomposite sensor materials will be developed first, followed by preparation
              of the substrate with high temperature electrodes, on to which the sensor film
              is deposited and then evaluated for sensitivity, response time and stability.
              
    The sensors to be developed will be applicable to high temperature engine
              control and monitoring, combustion system control for fossil-fueled power
              plants and incinerators, and monitoring of product gases from chemical process
              reactors.
