MRI/RUI:
              Acquisition of Touch Sensitive Plasma Displays and Supporting Equipment for
              Research and Research Training in Multiple Machine Interfaces

This proposal,
              studying multi-device classroom technology, centers on the design,
              implementation, and evaluation of pen-based computing groupware. The work,
              using touch sensitive plasma displays in research and research training in
              multiple machine interfaces, emphasizes the applications of such groupware to
              educational technology allowing for more display area in the classroom as well
              as the use of hand-held calculating devices. Along with the challenges
              associated with the multiple-machine interfaces that we deal with in everyday
              life, areas of particular interest to the investigators, such as performance
              modeling, data structures for storing information, databases,
              intercommunication of different computing devices, and educational technology
              are specifically addressed. The interfaces run simultaneously on co-located
              interconnected machines with varying sizes of screens. The research enhances
              and continues previous successful work of the principal investigators (PIs) in
              a primarily undergraduate university.
