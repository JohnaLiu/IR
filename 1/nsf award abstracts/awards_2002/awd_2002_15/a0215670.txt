This Major Research Instrumentation award to Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts provides funds to develop and test a
              prototype deep-water, acoustically-linked, moored-buoy seafloor observatory. 
              The system will consist of a discus buoy on a single-point, deep-water mooring,
              equipped with a satellite link for 2-way communication to shore and a
              high-speed acoustic modem for 2-way communication with sensors on the seafloor
              and on the mooring itself.  The suite of sensors, at two seafloor nodes, will
              include an ocean bottom seismograph (OBS), an acoustic current profiler (ADCP),
              hydrothermal flow meters with associated temperature, chemical and pressure
              sensors and a conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) instrument.  All will be
              interfaced to two acoustic modems, and they will transmit data to the surface
              buoy of the mooring, from which they will be transmitted daily to shore
              together with meteorological data from sensors on the surface buoy and current
              meter data from instruments installed on the mooring.  The mooring will be
              deployed for a 15-month demonstration project in the vicinity of the Nootka
              Fault, where complementary observatory experiments will be carried out under
              separate support from the Keck Foundation.   The project is supported by the
              Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF.  Cost-share support from non-federal funds
              will be provided for approximately 30% of total project costs.
