The acquisition of a new isotope-ratio-monitoring, gas
              chromatograph inlet mass spectrometer (IRMS-GC MS) equipped with four
              collectors and four channel output for simultaneous analysis of the ion beams
              of SF6 will make it possible to develop a new ultraviolet (UV) laser
              fluorination microprobe for the analysis of  32S, 33S, 34S, and 36S in sulfide
              minerals. Based on previous experience with the successful in situ
              microanalysis of oxygen isotopes in silicate minerals, it should be possible to
              measure 50-micrometer diameter spots on sulfide minerals with a precision of
              0.1 to 0.2 per mil in d33S and d34S and 0.05 per mil in ?33S.  Analysis for
              d36S will be at a lower level of precision owing to the rarity of the isotope
              36S. A new UV laser macroprobe and GC purification system has already been
              built and validated for 400 micrometer diameter spot measurements of sulfur
              isotopes using an existing mass spectrometer that is incapable of GC-continuous
              flow operation. The new IRMS-GC MS requested from NSF-MRI is needed to improve
              analytical spatial resolution from 400 to 50 micrometers. The new sulfur
              isotope microprobe will be used to test the validity of the discovery of
              mass-independent sulfur isotope anomalies in Archean rocks by direct
              fluorination of sulfide minerals. The proposed relationship between the
              anomalies and the oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere will be tested by detailed
              measurements of drill cores spanning the Archean-Proterozoic transition.  The
              mechanisms responsible for fixing mass-independent signatures in rocks will be
              investigated through spatially resolved analyses of inter-mineral
              fractionations and intra-mineral isotopic heterogeneity. The new microprobe's
              capacity to analyze microgram samples will be put to use in a laboratory study
              of the fractionation of sulfur isotopes by microbes.  Use of the new sulfur
              isotope microprobe will be open to qualified users from throughout the research
              community.
