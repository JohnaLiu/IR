Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will utilize an
              innovative high output ultraviolet (UV) lithography 0.25 mm T-gate fabrication
              process to develop high yield and high throughput manufacturing of
              millimeter-wave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC) transceivers on 6"
              substrates.   This effort will focus on  (1) developing high quality 6"
              metamorphic wafers for high circuit yield;  (2) demonstrate a metamorphic
              field-effect transistor (FET) using a 0.25 mm T-gate (non-E beam) process, (3)
              select the key MMIC to combine for high performance transceiver functionality. 
              Successful completing of these objectives will serve as the basis for combining
              proven MMICs for the design and fabrication of Ka-band and E-Band transceivers.
               

The MMIC technology market has shown great potential for applications in
              telecommunications (including radar-based systems).   Single function MMIC
              designs require expensive machining and packaging.  This effort should to a
              lower-cost transceiver for the $10 billion MMIC market.
