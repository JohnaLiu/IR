Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed at the
              continued development of novel microscale combustors/evaporators, which are
              intended for evaporation of fuel and water in fuel reformers as well as for
              personal portable heating and cooling systems. The general objective of the
              Phase II program is to optimize and scale up a technology for microchannel
              combustor/evaporators demonstrated in the Phase I and to develop a compact
              device, which could generate at least 25- 30 watts of thermal energy per square
              centimeter of heat transfer area and transfer that energy to fluid with
              efficiency greater than 85 percent. Innovative fabrication technology and a new
              microreactor concept were combined to create a highly efficient device, which
              uses hydrogen or hydrocarbon fuel combustion for heating and/or boiling working
              fluids. Conditions of heat transfer and combustion of hydrogen and methane in
              microchannel combustor/evaporators will be determined and optimal design of the
              microscale device will be established. 

Potential commercial applications
              include lightweight, safe and high performance microcombustors for
              microturbines, man-portable microheaters for cold climates, man portable
              cooling microsystems for hot climates, on-board fuel processors for hydrogen
              generation, distributed space conditioning of buildings, etc. Utilization of
              microchannel combustor/evaporators for these applications will result in
              increase of energy efficiency, reduction of air pollution and enhancement of
              life quality.
