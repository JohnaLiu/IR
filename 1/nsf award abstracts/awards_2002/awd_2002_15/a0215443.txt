ABSTRACT

The Department of Mathematics at the University of
              North
Carolina at Charlotte  will purchase computer equipment
which will be
              dedicated to the support of research in the
mathematical sciences. The
              equipment will be used for several 
research projects, including in
              particular: a) fast
algorithms for wave scattering in layered media
              for
electronic packaging and geophysical exploration, b) a PDE 
based
              nonlinear least squares approach to imaging in
diffusion tomography, c) tests
              for comparing mark-speciffic
hazards, d) pricing lookback-Asian options. The
              newly
established Ph.D. program in Applied Mathematics is
developing very
              rapidly and so are the demands for the
computing power coming from the body of
              graduate students
and researchers.

The Mathematics Department has played a
              prominent role in
the University's recent change in status to a doctoral
              status
by the state and continues to do so as the University
aggressively
              pushes its next goal of becoming designated
as Research Extensive. The
              availability of a high performance
computing server will be an integral part
              of the Mathematics
Department's continuing push to be at the forefront of
              the
University's research enterprise.
