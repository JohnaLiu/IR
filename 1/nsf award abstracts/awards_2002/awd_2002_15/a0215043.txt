The
              IEEE 2002 Workshop on Signal Processing Systems (SIPS02) will be held at the
              Catamaran Resort Hotel from October 16-18, 2002. SIPS02 focuses on topics at
              the convergence of signal processing theory, VLSI architectures, and integrated
              circuit implementation of multimedia communications. The conference theme this
              year reflects the critical role played by signal processing microsystems in the
              deployment of next
generation communications infrastructure including
              wireless, optical and wireline systems.  SIPS02 is requesting the National
              Science Foundation to provide a travel grant to provide travel funds to U.S.
              students who would otherwise not be able to attend this workshop.
