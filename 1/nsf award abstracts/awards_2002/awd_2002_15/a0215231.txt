Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop
              commercial uses for conjugates capable of exploiting cloned gene expression in
              transformed plant cells to control their growth and physiology.  The specific
              goal of this project is to synthesize  a series of new beta-glucuronide
              conjugates of plant regulatory substances and to test these conjugates for
              their ability to modify the growth and protein expression of specific tissues
              and cells expressing the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) marker gene. Conjugates will
              be assayed in tissue culture and in whole plants for the ability to cause
              localized cell death in a promoter dependent manner. Such compounds will be of
              general use for plant research on the control of development and gene
              expression and have the potential to produce agriculturally important plant
              species in a reversible manner, through the use of selective application of
              substrate and choice of reporter gene and promoter elements.

The commercial
              application of this project is in the area of agricultural biotechnology.
