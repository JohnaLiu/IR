MRI:  Acquisition of Research Computational Equipment

This
              proposal from an EPCoR state, aiming at performing collaborative research on
              computational and visualization aspects of various application areas, targets
              interactive computational environments and intelligent systems; more
              specifically, parallel processing, scientific visualization, and intelligent
              systems. The work, requiring a high performance infrastructure, supports
              complex computing and the ability to visualize, store, and easily retrieve
              large data sets. The advancement of research techniques again requires
              significantly improved distributed computing and visualization capabilities.
              The computational steering tools require analysis involving consistency,
              latency, scalability, and perturbation costs. Research activities in an
              Interactive Computational Environment (ICE) involve:
     1.  Seamless
              Monitoring and Steering of High-Performance Distributed Computations,
     2. 
              Realistic Simulators, and
     3.  Computational models.
The intelligent
              systems component explores information systems (new techniques and applications
              for machine learning, e.g., user profiles), information relevance and
              retrieval, efficient methods for human-computer interaction, and multi-agent
              research.
