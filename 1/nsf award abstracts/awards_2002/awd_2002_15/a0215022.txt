Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will lead to the
              development of a new type of widely tunable external cavity diode laser for use
              in next generation optical networks. These networks, parts of which are being
              deployed now, will rely on a high degree of network flexibility, especially on
              the ability to dynamically provision wavelengths throughout the communication
              grid upon demand. Key to deployment of such networks will be the availability
              of widely tunable source lasers at price points that are competitive with
              present fixed-wavelength telecommunications lasers. 

The result of this
              multiphase R&D effort will be production and marketing of a widely tunable
              transmitter module for long-haul telecommunications.
