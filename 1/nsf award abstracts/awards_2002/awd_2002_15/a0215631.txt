Abstract    :
              
Many theories of ethnic tensions are "backward looking" in the sense that they
              focus on how past experiences shape current attitudes.  They therefore depict
              ethnic relations as relatively static and unchanging. By contrast, repeated
              game models of interpersonal relations are forward looking.  In these models, a
              person's actions today are influenced by how she expects others will respond to
              those actions in the future. This project develops a theoretical model of
              racial or ethnic tensions in a forward-looking repeated game framework.  If a
              community is partially segregated, then relationships will be more frequently
              repeated within groups than across groups.  People may therefore cooperate more
              with members of their own group than with members of other groups.  That is,
              people may trust members of other groups less than members of their own group. 
              We interpret this as a form of ethnic tension.  In this context, this study
              shows that everyone may prefer integration to partial segregation, in spite of
              these ethnic tensions. This is because the benefits from increased cooperation
              across groups may outweigh the cost of shifting from cooperative own-group
              interactions to less cooperative cross-group interactions.  In addition, the
              study shows that minorities tend to suffer more from ethnic tensions than
              non-minorities.  On the other hand, the study shows that an individual may not
              be able to improve her cross-ethnic relationships unless she is able to commit
              herself to interact more frequently with members of other ethnic groups in the
              future.  It follows that individuals may need to use commitment mechanisms,
              such as residential proximity, a common employer, or marriage, to facilitate
              cooperation with members of other groups.

Forward looking models of ethnic
              tensions are important because they suggest that ethnic relations can be very
              responsive to changing conditions.  This can be a bad thing since, for example,
              ethnic demagogues  may be able to break down trust across ethnic lines.  Such a
              breakdown of trust can become self-fulfilling, as both sides become pessimistic
              about their future relationships, and so, treat each other worse today. On the
              other hand, the forward looking nature of ethnic relations can be a good thing
              since, for example, a community that was previously sharply divided along
              ethnic lines can quickly become less divided under favorable social and
              political conditions.  If these favorable conditions make people more
              optimistic about their future cross-ethnic relationships, then they will be
              more careful to cultivate those relationships today.  Models of ethnic tensions
              among forward-looking agents are therefore important because they highlight
              important risks and opportunities in improving ethnic relations.  These models
              may also
suggest new ways to help overcome these ethnic tensions.
