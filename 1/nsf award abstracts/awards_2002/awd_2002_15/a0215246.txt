Abstract    :
              The project aims to improve the capabilities of the Jicamarca incoherent scatter
              radar for equatorial F-region observations via the development of a new
              observing/signal-processing mode based on spectral fitting and magneto-ionic
              differential-phase measurements: With radar beams pointed perpendicular to B,
              self- and cross-spectra of O- and X-mode incoherent scatter returns collected
              with orthogonal dipole pairs and a pair of north-south displayed dipole arrays
              will be fitted to a forward theory model to infer F-region plasma drifts,
              densities, and electron and ion temperatures with 5 min and 15 km time and
              height resolutions. The inversion procedure will also make use of
              simultaneously collected ionosonde data and furthermore will be capable of
              F-region plasma density measurements during equatorial spread F conditions. The
              project will constitute an excellent training ground for graduate students on
              ionospheric propagation and incoherent scatter theories and will furthermore
              provide an opportunity for stringent tests of the F-region incoherent scatter
              theory in a relatively unexplored parameter regime (small aspect angles).
