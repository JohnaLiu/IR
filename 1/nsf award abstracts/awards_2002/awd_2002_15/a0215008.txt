Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
              establish the technical and economic feasibility of a novel photocatalytic
              technology to inactivate air-borne surrogate bacterial spores representative of
              Bacillus anthracis (anthrax bacteria). The technology is to be incorporated
              into circulating air ducts of buildings, providing protection against
              introduction of anthrax into central air systems by a terrorist act. The
              investigators have previously  developed a new class of photocatalysts that are
              orders of magnitude more active for organic compound oxidation than the
              traditional titania. This new class of photocatalysts will be adapted for use
              in anthrax spore destruction. The program will utilize photocatalyst
              composition studies to tailor a superior photocatalyst for this application, to
              be followed by reactor studies of the bactericidal efficacy of the new
              photocatalysts, and a competitive cost analysis of the technology relative to
              other alternatives for maintenance of indoor air quality. 

The immediate
              commercial application of this project is in the area of homeland security. 
              The proposed technology will protect against the threat of introduction of
              lethal anthrax spores into central air systems.
