Abstract    :
              The project will develop a climatology of reactive nitrogen compounds in the
              lower free troposphere at the Pico Observatory in the Azores.  The study is
              designed to address the need for measurement-based constraints on levels of
              nitrogen oxides in the remote free troposphere by providing approximately two
              years of nearly continuous measurements at 2200 m altitude over the North
              Atlantic Ocean.  The data will be used to improve understanding of reactive
              nitrogen chemistry over the ocean environment, for comparison with models, and
              to look at the transport of continental emissions over the Atlantic Ocean.
