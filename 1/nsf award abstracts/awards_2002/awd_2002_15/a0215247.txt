Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address the
              critical need for a commercial rheo-meter that can be used to measure all three
              shear flow properties of a molten thermoplastic. Currently available commercial
              rheo-meters can measure at best only two of the three independent shear flow
              properties, which are the viscosity, first normal stress difference (N1), and
              second normal stress difference (N2). The objective of the proposed project is
              to demonstrate proof-of-principle for a novel rheo-meter plate with
              monolithically integrated miniature pressure sensors fabricated using
              micro-electro-mechanical systems technology. It will be shown that this novel
              rheo-meter plate can be used to extend the capabilities of conventional
              rheo-meters, enabling measurement of all three shear flow properties with
              greater accuracy than previously possible.

The innovative rheo-meter plate
              will allow smaller sample sizes to be used, with greater control over sample
              thickness during testing and should lead to better design and control of
              manufacturing processes with polymeric materials and spectrometers.
