Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a Regional Center for Ocean Sciences Education
              Excellence with administrative offices located at the University of Southern
              Mississippi's Marine Education Center and Aquarium in Biloxi, Ms.   The
              proposal would establish satellite centers in Louisiana, and Alabama and expand
              existing USM teacher professional development efforts into these states.   This
              Center would make extensive use of the expertise of regional marine educators
              as interpreters of ocean and coastal marine science research in professional
              development institutes for formal and informal educators. This center will be
              one of seven regional centers that represent the initiation of the COSEE
              network. The initial set of centers covers most of the East Coast, Florida, the
              Gulf Coast, and California. A central coordinating office for the seven centers
              will also be funded.
