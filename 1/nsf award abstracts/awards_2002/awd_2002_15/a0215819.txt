Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project will develop a
              novel microchip chemical analyzer that incorporates a new nanomaterial that
              performs both separation and detection of small quantities of chemicals and
              biochemicals. Phase I demonstrated feasibility by incorporating a proprietary
              nanomaterial in 20- by 50-micron channels etched in a glass microchip and
              performing chemical separation and surface-enhanced Raman spectral analysis of
              several test chemicals. Phase II will complete development of the microchip
              chemical analyzer by designing reproducible plastic microchip cards that fit
              into an integrated micro-fluidics and Raman system. Development will include
              the following chemicals: p-aminobenzoic acid, phenyl acetylene, adenine,
              acetaminophen, secobarbitol, cocaine, and related metabolites.

The microchip
              analyzer will have broad commercial value to the agricultural, biotech,
              chemical agents, environmental, medical and pharmaceutical industries.
              Specifically, the microchip is being designed to measure drugs and metabolites
              in body fluids to aid clinical trials of new drugs, assist dosage control of
              chemotherapeutic drugs, and diagnose drug overdose.
