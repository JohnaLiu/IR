Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes the
              development of integrated optoelectronic circuits through a novel integration
              process. These devices will be hybrid electronic/optical elements embedded in
              an integrated platform comparable in size to existing electronic integrated
              circuits, and will permit the monolithic integration of microelectronic and
              photonic elements.  This project will fabricate a test 'chip' to demonstrate
              controllable phase modulation on the sub-micron scale while contemplating the
              integration of multiple devices onto a single platform to confirm dense
              integration densities. 

This approach to integrated optoelectronic circuits
              to act as an enabling technology for tomorrow's dense optical networks,
              significantly improve processing speed and computational precision for multiple
              applications including intra-computer and inter-computer communications, image
              processing, and increasingly more dense processing platforms. This potential
              suggests that integrated optoelectronic circuits will have applications in the
              telecomm industry, the medical imaging device market, and the computing
              equipment market including, but not limited to, Digital Signal Processors and
              CPUs for digital communications networks.
