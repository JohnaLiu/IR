Landry
This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of
              Hawaii at Manoa supports the acquisition of a high-performance, multi-laser
              sorting flow cytometer to continue an active program of plankton community
              research in open-ocean ecosystems, as well as providing a shared-use facility
              for other research in marine biology, microbial ecology, cell regulation and
              culture of aquatic organisms.  It will replace a heavily-used, but aging, flow
              cytometer that has been operated as a shared-use facility since 1991.  The new
              instrument will provide important new capabilities, and will be particularly
              well suited for study of extremely small "picoplankton" such as the
              photosynthetic bacterium Prochlorococcus, that are important marine primary
              producers, but are very difficult to study with other techniques.
