Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a Regional Center for Ocean Sciences Education
              Excellence with administrative offices located at the South Carolina Sea Grant
              Consortium Office in Charleston, SC. The center will focus on the North
              Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia region, and center personnel will work to
              forge stronger relationships between research organizations, researchers,
              schools and informal educational sites in the region. The Southeastern Center
              for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence (SECOSEE) will also reach out to
              underrepresented groups in the ocean sciences by creating programs based on the
              unique African American coastal heritage in the area. Activities include an
              inventory of existing ocean science materials and programs, awareness workshops
              for educators and researchers, collaborations between researchers and
              educators, enhanced professional development opportunities, supplemental school
              and summer science programs, website development, and evaluation. 

This
              center will be one of seven COSEE's that represent the initiation of the COSEE
              network. The initial set of centers covers most of the East Coast, Florida, the
              Gulf Coast, and California. A central coordinating office for the seven centers
              will also be funded. Substantial funding for the SECOSEE program will be
              provided by NOAA's Coastal Ocean Services and Office of Ocean Exploration.
