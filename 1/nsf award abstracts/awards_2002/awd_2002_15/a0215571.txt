Abstract    :
              A grant has been awarded to Dr. Bruce Kohorn at Bowdoin College in order
to
              purchase a confocal laser scanning microscope. The microscope will
provide the
              ability to obtain high resolution fluorescent images from both
live and fixed
              biological samples, and will become the only such instrument
in Maine at a
              liberal arts undergraduate college. The microscope will be
used to explore
              fundamental questions in neurobiology and behavior, plant
development, nuclear
              protein transport, evolutionary genetics, and
biomechanics. Seven faculty and
              their students from the Biology and
Psychology departments of Bowdoin 
              College, and two faculty from Bates and
Colby College will use the instrument
              to achieve high resolution images for
basic  biological research.

 The new
              instrument will be used by many faculty in their research on
topics that
              include the function of the nervous system, the organization of
cells, and the
              comparison of cellular structures so as to understand basic
processes of
              evolution.  The students in research labs will be exposed to
current and
              standard technologies that they too will need to use once in
more advanced
              degree programs. Students will be prepared for careers in
Biology and related
              fields by providing the technical and theoretical
background for one of the
              most common methods of imaging in cell and
molecular biology.
