This award to University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of
              Marine and Atmospheric Sciences provides instrumentation to improve the
              shared-use scientific instrumentation available to researchers using three
              research ships operated by University of Miami and the Harbor Branch
              Oceanographic Institution.  These three vessels, R/Vs Seward Johnson, Seward
              Johnson II, and Walton Smith, are all operated as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  The
              specific instrumentation supported by this award includes a phased array, 75
              kHz acoustic Doppler current meter for installation on R/V Seward Johnson II,
              and a multi-corer device for collecting undisturbed seafloor samples from any
              of the three ships.  These new capabilities will be of substantial advantage to
              marine scientists using the ships in their research during 2001 and future
              years.
