Abstract    :
              This Major Research Instrumentation RUI grant supports state-of-the-art
              nanoindentation equipment for Grinnell College to conduct research on the
              fundamental mechanisms of friction at the molecular level. The specific
              equipment, a Hysitron TriboScope nanoindenter, is a probe device that
              simultaneously measures normal and lateral forces, probe displacements, and
              contact area. It can be interfaced with the Digital Instruments control base
              already existing at Grinnell College. Student researchers will make use of the
              equipment. Grinnell College's Physics Department graduates 10 to 20 physics
              majors per year and has attained unique success in bringing women and minority
              students into physics. Half of Grinnell's physics graduates pursue graduate
              study in the sciences. The department views student-faculty research as an
              extremely valuable part of an undergraduate physics education, benefiting both
              students and faculty alike. 

The self-assembled monolayer systems to be
              studied using this nanoindenter show promise as lubricants for a new generation
              of microdynamic devices. They are also well-controlled experimental and
              theoretical model systems for investigating the energy dissipation mechanisms
              underlying friction.
