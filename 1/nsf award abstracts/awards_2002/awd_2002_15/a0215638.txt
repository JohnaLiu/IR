It is proposed to carry out experimental investigation of the dynamics
              of breaking waves.
Experiments will be carried out in wave channels at Scripps
              Institution of Oceanography to achieve the following objectives.  (1)
              Evaluation of the turbulent kinetic energy  (TKE) budget under breaking waves. 
              (2) Examination of the scaling of the total dissipation due to breaking as a
              function of Reynolds and Bond numbers. And (3) study of the initial stages of
              breaking and impact using high-speed video technique.  The broader impacts of
              the proposed research include applications of the results to the practice of
              coastal and ocean engineering, naval architecture, and air-sea interactions,
              and training of Ph.D. student.  The PI will continue to support K-12 education
              by hosting class visits to Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
