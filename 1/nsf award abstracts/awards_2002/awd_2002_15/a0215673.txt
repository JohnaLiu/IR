The Digital
              Human: Towards Unified Ontology for Biomedical Modeling and Simulation

This
              workshop is bringing together researchers from a variety of disciplines to
              develop a unified ontology for biomedical modeling and simulation.  The goal is
              to develop an ontology that can specify both lower-level cellular models and
              higher-level tissue, organ and systems models in a manner that is most useful
              for modeling and simulation. The workshop is organized to specify requirements
              for the ontology, based on existing models such as the Digital Anatomist
              Foundation Model of Rosse et al and the emerging BioSPICE ontology.  An initial
              draft of a unified ontology that extends from gross anatomy to cellular
              components and a detailed plan for converting this draft into a system that can
              be widely accepted by the research community and can serve as the basis for
              developing interoperable simulations and other representations of these systems
              is in preparation.  The draft is being prepared by the principle investigators
              supported by graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, prior to the workshop
              that will provide an in-depth peer review of the proposed ontology and the plan
              for next steps

A final document being generated by the participants will be
              a concrete action plan for establishing a framework though which existing
              ontologies may be unified, expanded and enhanced.  As a result, unification of
              cell-organ ontologies is enhancing the ability of researchers and developers to
              prepare interoperable simulation models in biomedicine, leading to advancement
              of our understanding of multiple levels of biological structure and
              function.
