The PI's request funds to help support
              travel costs of conference participants to the 8th symposium of Study of the
              Earth's Deep Interior, to be held in July, 2002 in Lake Tahoe, California.  The
              program this year will focus on the geophysical and geochemical evolution of
              the Earth's deep interior and is focused mainly on the Earth's core. This
              meeting will be an important venue for a diverse group of researchers to
              integrate their ideas and develop a consistent picture on questions such as the
              age of the inner core, the driving forces for the geodynamo, the structure of
              the inner core, and the behavior of the paleomagnetic fielding the distant
              past.  The meeting format is well designed and should stimulate discussion
              among conference attendees.
