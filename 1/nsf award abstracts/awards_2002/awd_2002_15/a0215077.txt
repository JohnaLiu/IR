Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at
              developing a novel low-cost method for the preparation of Multi-Walled Carbon
              Nanotubes (MWCNT) for Field Emission Displays (FED) applications. Carbon
              nanotubes (CNTs) are characterized by high aspect ratio and small radius of
              curvature at their tips. This structural property, together with high
              electrical conduction, chemical inertness and mechanical strength makes them
              promising emitters for field emission flat panel displays. CNTs have been
              conventionally prepared by high-pressure, chemical-vapor-deposition processes,
              but these approaches have serious limitations owing to high cost of production.
              Recently suggested alternative methods of CNT preparation include plasma
              activation and catalytic growth, but they are limited by low yields or metal
              contaminations. In this Phase I effort, Materials Modification, Inc. proposes
              to synthesize carbon nanotubes from readily available raw materials by
              combining a pyrolysis and chemical process. The CNT thus produced will be
              chemically pure since no metal catalyst is used in the process and any
              side-products formed are in vapor state and will not contaminate
              it.

Potential commercial applications include display aided flat bedded
              control panels, all types of touch screen facilities, flat panel monitors for
              both professional and entertainment displays, and naval and air surveillance
              systems.
