Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will synthesize
              semiconductor interconnects by using a novel chemical vapor deposition
              technique for deposition of silver and copper films on high aspect ratio
              patterned substrates for sub 100 nm CMOS devices. This technique called hybrid
              chemical vapor deposition combines the advantages of conventional Chemical
              Vapor Deposition to achieve integrated circuit super filling, of trenches and
              vias under low temperature processing conditions. This technique utilizes
              precursors made with metallic nanoparticles (size of metallic particles: 35 nm)
              that can be uniformly dispersed inorganic solutions using appropriate
              surfactants. The liquid precursor can be transported to the patterned wafer
              surface in the form of mist and under appropriate low temperature thermal
              conditions can form a conformal film of metal on the surface, which further
              aggregates inside the pores to achieve super filling. Initial work conducted on
              copper films has shown very promising results. 

Application of the research
              is expected in microelectronics industry.  The important are of reliable
              interconnects will help signal integrity.  The successful development of hybrid
              chemical vapor deposition process has not yet been reported in the literature
              and would represent an important advancement in metal thin film deposition
              process.
