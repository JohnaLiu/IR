Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to
              investigate the application of an automatic inference engine called "Discovery
              Machine" to the domain of gene mapping.  Discovery Machine is a set of
              knowledge acquisition tools that aid experts in solving problems over large
              amounts data.  The proposed enhancements to the Discovery Machine will allow
              genetics experts to model their own strategies for interpreting the information
              needed to map genes.  The development of bioinformatics tools is aimed at
              researchers who wish to better leverage computing power to solve problems
              across large sets of data but cannot easily write software to enable their
              efforts.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of
              bioinformatics.
