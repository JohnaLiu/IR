Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will evaluate a
              technology capable of meeting the demands of future mobile wireless information
              systems. The fundamental challenge facing designers of the physical layer of
              mobile networking solutions is to improve speed, precision, and power
              efficiency. Athena's proprietary arithmetic technology, which enables engineers
              to rapidly develop high performance semiconductors, can provide up to 10 times
              higher performance or up to 10 times less power compared to existing
              technologies. The Phase I study will evaluate opportunities to apply this
              arithmetic technology to mobile wireless systems by developing an
              infrastructure technology targeted for placement between the antenna and the
              back-end digital processor. The goal of the project is to demonstrate that this
              infrastructure technology can meet or exceed the industry performance standards
              in a 250mW, low-power package. 
     The company will be able to rapidly
              develop high performance, high accuracy, low power solutions for the wireless
              communications market. Specific applications include use in automobiles where
              information, audio, navigation, and other services will be linked.
