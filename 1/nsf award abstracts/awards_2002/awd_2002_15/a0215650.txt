Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for a topical conference entitled
              "Opportunities in Biology for Physicists", to be held in Boston on September
              27-29, 2002. The conference will be aimed predominantly at graduate students
              and postdocs in physics who are considering applying the methods of physics to
              biological topics. Physicists and biologists who are leaders in their fields
              will be asked to give broad overviews of selected areas at the interface
              between physics and biology. In addition, there will be talks on the "how to"
              of moving into the interface between the disciplines.  Support is provided
              jointly by the Physics Division and by the Office of Multidisciplinary
              Activities in the MPS Directorate.
