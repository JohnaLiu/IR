This Major Research Instrumentation grant provides funds to
              Oberlin College to purchase equipment that will enable the PIs to map, analyze,
              and visualize in three dimensions both mesoscopic geological structures and
              archeological sites as well as the geographic/geologic environment in which
              they occur. The equipment will include: (1) a Trimble 3600 total station, a
              Trimble GPS total station, two Trimble ProXRS backpack-style GPS receivers, and
              four Trimble Explorer hand-held GPS units.  The PIs will use this equipment to
              map with high precision the surface topography of geological and archeological
              research sites and to locate data stations, geologic samples, and archeological
              artifacts.  The PIs are faculty from three departments at Oberlin College, a
              private, four-year undergraduate liberal arts college. They will use the
              requested equipment to enhance their existing individual research projects in
              geology and archeology, to undertake new collaborative research at an
              archeological site in Italy, and to train research students in modern
              techniques for surveying, three-dimensional visualization, and
              three-dimensional analysis. The equipment will be stored in the Department of
              Geology, and PI Wojtal will assume primary responsibility for training,
              equipment maintenance, and the scheduling of equipment use.
