Abstract    :
              This Major Research Instrumentation RUI grant supports acquisition of a
              Mossbauer spectroscopy system that will be used to further understanding of the
              structures and interactions that take place between tin-iron probe molecules
              and different liquid crystal polymer systems. Mossbauer spectroscopy will be
              applied to investigate the chemistry and structure of heterobimetallic
              polynuclear compounds containing iron and tin. These iron-tin compounds will be
              used as probe molecules to study the glassy phase of several liquid crystalline
              polymeric materials. This investigation will be carried out by undergraduate
              students involved in research projects directed by the chemistry and physics
              faculty at Bloomsburg University and Fayette campus of the Pennsylvania State
              University respectively. 

The equipment provides the capability to
              systematically investigate liquid crystal polymer systems by introducing both
              orientational and translational order by using the heterobimetallic and
              heterotrimetallic compounds. The equipment enhances the undergraduate research
              programs at two institutions by giving the students the ability to have
              hands-on experience with updated equipment. It will also be used as part of an
              undergraduate instrumentation course giving students the opportunity to learn
              the techniques of spectroscopy.
