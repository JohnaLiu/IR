TITLE: Workshop
              Proposal: Genomic Signal Processing and Statistics

This grant provides
              partial support for a Workshop on Genomic Signal Processing ands Statistics
              (GENSIPS).  The workshop is being held October 12 and 13, 2002, near the North
              Carolina State University campus.  The goals of the workshop are 1) to identify
              potential areas of research collaboration between the biological, statistical
              and signal processing communities and 2) to explore potential new avenues of
              research in genetics by exploiting synergies in research between signal
              processing, statistics, and genonomics.  The workshop brings together a diverse
              set of outstanding researchers from each of these areas to address the
              challenges of the multidisciplinary area of genomics.  Twelve internationally
              known researchers are presenting plenary and invited talks and the workshop
              also features poster sessions and round-table discussions of the key topics.
