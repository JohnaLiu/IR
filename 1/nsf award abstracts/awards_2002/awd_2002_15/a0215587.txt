Abstract    :
              The investigators seek to advance the creation of a Cooperative Institute for
              Deep Earth Research (CIDER). This award will provide funds to hold a series of
              2 workshops over a period of one to two years whose goal will be to define the
              scope and activities of a possible future CIDER.  The workshops will be
              interdisciplinary in nature and will address the question of global Earth
              structure, evolution, and dynamics.  Participation will be open to the
              community.  The direct product of each workshop will be a report listing the
              key questions identified during the workshop, whose resolution requires an
              interdisciplinary approach, as well as recommendations for the activities and
              structure of the future CIDER.  These documents will then be used as a basis
              for the preparation of a detailed proposal for the establishment of CIDER.
