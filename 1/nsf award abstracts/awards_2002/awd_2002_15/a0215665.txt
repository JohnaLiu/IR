Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for international travel by eight American scientists
              and engineers, and four students to Cheju Island, Korea to participate in an
              international workshop on Advanced Applications for Carbon Materials.  The
              workshop will be co-organized by the Engineering Research Center (ERC) for
              Advanced Engineering Fibers and Films at Clemson University and Chungnam
              University, Korea.  The expenses of  Korean participation and costs for local
              arrangements will be borne by the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation
              (KOSEF).  The conference program will include sessions on novel applications
              and processing techniques, carbon materials for environmental applications,
              carbon nanomaterials, carbon materials for storage applications, and
              carbon/carbon materials.
