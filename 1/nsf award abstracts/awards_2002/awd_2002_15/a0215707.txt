Abstract    :
              This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of Washington supports
              the development of a fiber optic back scatter instrument, FOBS-2, which will be
              used for research in near-bottom sediment transport.  The instrument will
              provide closely spaced, accurate measurements of suspended sediment
              concentration near the bottom in high energy, near-shore environments,
              providing a significant improvement over existing capabilities.  The present
              award will support system design, fabrication of two instruments, and testing
              in both laboratory and field settings.  The instrument design will be made
              available to other researchers, and University of Washington will also build
              instruments for other research groups.
