This Major Research Instrumentation award to New York
              University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences provides funds for
              acquisition of instrumentation for experimental research in geophysical fluid
              dynamics, especially focusing on quantitative aspects of atmosphere and ocean
              processes.  Specific instruments to be acquired include a particle image
              velocimeter (PIV) and a planar laser induced fluorescence tool (PLIF) plus
              associated tanks, filters and plumbing fixtures, allowing accurate evaluation
              and measurement of 3-dimensional flow properties under controlled conditions. 
              The instrumentation will be mounted for use on an existing geophysical fluid
              rotating table.  The new instrumentation will provide an important experimental
              capability for testing and validating model and theory, as well as an important
              set of tools for laboratory studies by students in the Center for
              Atmosphere-Ocean Science.  The project is supported by the Division of Ocean
              Sciences at NSF. New York University will provide cost-share support from
              non-federal funds for 30% of total project costs.
