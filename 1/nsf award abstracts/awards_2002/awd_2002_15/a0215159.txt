Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will demonstrate
              the feasibility of producing flexible displays that can be used to make radio
              frequency identification (RFID) electronic labels. These labels will be
              electronic analogs of paper labels. The innovation will be to combine known
              flexible RFID circuitry with flexible displays to create an electronic
              paper-like label that can be wirelessly updated. . The Phase I activities will
              involve active matrix backplane fabrication on polyimide substrates followed by
              display construction using a polymerized liquid crystal mixture. 

The
              commercial applications include retail electronic shelf labels, airline
              security luggage identification, and employee identification tags. The use of
              these tags for airline security luggage tags and employee identification
              represent applications that address issues in homeland security.
