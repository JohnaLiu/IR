Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              cost-effective, fast-acting sensor for detecting the presence of nitroaromatic
              explosives. It involves a unique chemical detection technology in which
              colorimetric changes in an array of dyes constitute a signal much like that
              generated by the mammalian olfaction system; each dye is a cross-responsive
              sensor. This technology has been dubbed "Smell-Seeing". The program is designed
              to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility of the electronic
              nose when used to detect nitroaromatic explosives and to integrate the
              smell-seeing technology into an inexpensive, portable monitor for real-time
              detection of explosive substances.

This work will result in a hand-held,
              battery-powered device for preventative surveillance and early detection of
              these compounds, thereby reducing risk to the general public, public servants
              and military personnel here and around the world.
