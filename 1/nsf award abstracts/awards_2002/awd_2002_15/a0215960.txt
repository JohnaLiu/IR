Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will
              produce an emission-free control valve to address an industry need for
              environmentally safe valves.  The axially rotated Venturi Off-Set Technology
              valve will be equipped with a conical seat for internal sealing and a magnetic
              coupling for leak-proof actuation.  
     The commercial potential of this
              project will provide the Petroleum industry with valves that are emission-free
              which will result in a cleaner environment.
