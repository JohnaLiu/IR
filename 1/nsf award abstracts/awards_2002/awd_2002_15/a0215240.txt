Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Projectproposes to
              develop methods for producing fullerene radioisotope carriers using the nuclear
              recoil implantation method. A persistent problem in the safe delivery of
              radioisotopes to cancer tissue is the premature leakage of the radioisotope and
              the damage it causes to healthy tissues such as bone marrow. Currently, when
              radioactive metals are used in the body for diagnostic or therapeutic
              applications, organic chelates must be employed as carriers for the metal atom.
              However, current chelates do not bind with 100% efficiency, and potentially
              toxic radioactive metal atoms can be lost in vivo. Because of their unique cage
              structure, fullerenes do not suffer this deficiency and offer a novel
              alternative method for entrapping radioisotopes and producing labeled compounds
              useful for medical imaging and therapy.

The commercial applications of this
              project are in the area of cancer radioimmunotherapy. Given the recent advances
              in the design of monoclonal antibodies for targeting cancer and in the 
              clinical successes of several new radioimmunotherapy treatments, the field of
              radioimmunotherapy is currently poised for rapid growth and commercialization.
              A superior radioisotope carrier would be a welcome addition to the current
              arsenal of radiopharmaceuticals.
