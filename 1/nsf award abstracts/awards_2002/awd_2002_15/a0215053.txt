Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop the
              technology necessary to produce low-power, low-noise VLSI amplifiers for
              large-scale neural recording applications. Although there are many emerging
              multi-electrode arrays for neuroscience and neuroprosthetic recording
              applications, these arrays are practically limited by wiring densities and
              percutaneous connections. In order for chonic neural recording applications to
              achieve electrode densities in the 100 to 1000 electrode range, implantable
              amplifier, signal processing, and multiplexing circuitry will be required. The
              existing VLSI technology available for microelectrode recording is inadequate
              to create implantable amplifier systems with this number of channels. These
              types of implantable amplifier systems will also be necessary for emerging
              clinical neuroprosthetic applications that will require chronic recording from
              large numbers of neurons in the brain. In this Phase I project, novel CMOS
              techniques will be developed for producing the necessary high-density,
              low-power amplifier elements. In the follow on Phase II project, these
              techniques will be integrated and fully developed into implantable amplifier
              systems for neuroscience and neuroprosthetic research. 

The commercial
              application of this project is in the area of biomedical device and
              instrumentation.  The implantable biopotential amplifier systems produced in
              this project will be directly marketed to neuroscience researchers for use with
              high-density microelectrode arrays. The technology will also be used in the
              development of clinical neuroprosthetic applications.
