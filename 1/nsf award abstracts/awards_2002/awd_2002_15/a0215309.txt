Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project seeks to develop
              and commercialize novel types of 3D microphotonic materials and devices for the
              visible spectrum. Despite the significant amount of research performed on
              photonic bandgap materials in the past decade, an approach to create full 3D
              photonic crystals in the visible region that could combine high performance
              with low cost manufacturability has remained a largely unobtainable goal. This
              breakthrough approach is enabled by an unique ability to precisely modulate the
              vertical pore structure in highly ordered nanoporous alumina, which can allow
              the confinement of light not just in-plane, but in 3 dimensions. The process
              will allow tuning of the photonic characteristics of the material, in
              particular the bandgap, to the desired levels. Several innovative techniques to
              deposit materials inside the nanoporous lattice will afford both lateral and
              vertical modification of the refractive index of the structure. This, combined
              with the ability to micromachine the resulting structures, will enable the
              creation of advanced microphotonic and optoelectronic devices and components
              for optical communications and computing.

The techniques proposed could lead
              to the creation of dense monolithic photonic and optoelectronic components and
              circuits for very high speed optical computing and communication.
