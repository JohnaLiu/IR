Abstract    :
              The funds requested in this proposal are to help support the CAARI 2002:
17th
              International Conference on the Application of Accelerators in Research and
              Industry.  The conference is jointly sponsored by The Division of Nuclear
              Physics NSF, The Department of Energy (Nuclear Physics), The American Physical
              Society, and the University of North Texas.  Approximately 1000 participants
              will attend the conference from 50 countries.  The funds requested will be used
              specifically to help fund the participation of 15 young scientists, who will be
              invited speakers at the meeting.  The conference is composed of 500
              presentations on the use of particle accelerators in applied and pure science. 
              The applied science includes topics such as; ion beam analysis of materials,
              synchrotron experiments, neutron and charged particle activation analysis, ion
              implantation, and medical radioisotope production and use.  The research topics
              covered include mostly atomic and nuclear physics experiments below an incident
              beam energy of 25
MeV.  Other details of the meeting can be found on our
              website: http://orgs.unt.edu/CAARI
