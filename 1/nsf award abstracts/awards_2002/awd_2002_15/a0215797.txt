Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is designed to
              develop a nonintrusive diode laser sensor for detecting oxygen in the headspace
              of pharmaceutical vials. Many drugs are oxygen sensitive and must be bottled in
              an oxygen free environment. There are no nonintrusive
methods available to
              measure residual oxygen levels in sealed product vials. A nonintrusive sensor
              would generate large cost savings for pharmaceutical manufacturers. During the
              Phase II project, a prototype off-line instrument will be constructed. This
              instrument will be tested at pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. In
              addition if time permits, on-line experimental measurements will be
              performed.

In addition to being useful for the pharmaceutical industry, this
              technology will be extendable to a variety of packaged products in other
              industries. These industries include the food, alcoholic beverage, and medical
              instrument markets. This technology can also be used to detect
other species
              in packaged products such as water vapor or carbon dioxide.
