Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I  project proposes to
              develop a new biopolymer for primary metal removal and a poly-g-glutamic acid
              (g-PGA)diafiltration system for recovery of metals from dilute solutions.
              Preliminary results obtained to date indicate that this process holds
              considerable promise in effectively removing metals from dilute aqueous streams
              to within EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) acceptable limits. The research
              planned in Phase I is expected to  demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
              g-PGA-PEDF(polymer enhanced diafiltration) system. It is also expected to show
              that g-PGA will achieve satisfactory metal uptake, that it will reduce
              representative metal concentrations to EPA mandated levels, and that it is 
              amenable to suitable regeneration cycles. Finally, it is expected that the
              proposed process will satisfactorily treat the representative industrial
              wastewaters. These results will set the stage for the development efforts in
              Phase II that will further consolidate the efficacy of the process, and address
              scale-up and commercialization issues.

The commercial applications of this
              project are in the processing of industrial wastewaters within established EPA
              guidelines.
