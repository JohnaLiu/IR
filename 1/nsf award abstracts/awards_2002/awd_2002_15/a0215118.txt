Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project concerns the
              development of a multi-channel fluorescence lifetime measuring instrument using
              a novel low-cost digitizer. The key to bringing the well-known utility of
              fluorescence lifetime measurements "to the masses" is to have a low-cost
              instrument with excellent speed and accuracy. This work will pioneer a
              measuring technique that, by taking advantage of recent developments in lasers,
              goes a long way toward meeting the needs of such an instrument. However, there
              is one vital component, the digitizer that presently accounts for more than
              half of the cost.
Commercially available digitizers do not match the needs of
              the application and are therefore too expensive or lack essential capabilities.
              However, This work has found a unique custom ASIC that appears to be a good
              match. This ASIC is a waveform digitizer developed at Berkeley National
              Laboratory for the AMANDA neutrino telescope.
     This work will prototype
              and characterizes a multi-channel fluorescence lifetime measuring instrument
              that uses this ASIC as the digitizer. If the phase I objectives are achieved,
              this work will be able to build exceptionally affordable instruments that can
              enable and greatly expand the use of fluorescence lifetime measurements in a
              vast range of applications.
