Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project was motivated by
              the need for rapid in-line inspection of quality of nanometer-scale devices in
              a production environment. An efficient diagnostics instrument, like the
              proposed product, is a rudimentary requirement for improved business operation
              in related industries minimizing possibilities for loss of revenue. The
              proposed innovative approach aims at developing an integrated technology using
              both electron and ion beams. Unique to this work is the idea of incorporating
              very special merits of high-brightness negative ion beams in a critical
              technology for device inspection. A novel system will be built to (i) deliver
              high yield in device inspection, (ii) achieve nm-level resolution and (iii)
              insure device integrity. This research will identify the characteristics of
              appropriate ion species from proof-of-principles experiments. 

Application
              of this work would be the design and development of an optimized ion beam
              column for the microelectronics industry.  The end product would be an
              integrated product with improved optical characteristics.
