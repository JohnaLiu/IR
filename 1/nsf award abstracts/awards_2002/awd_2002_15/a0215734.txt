With this award from the MRI program, the State
              University of New York College at Oneonta (SUNY Oneonta) will acquire an
              inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) and microwave
              digestion system (MDS). The research carried out with these instruments, both
              at SUNY Oneonta and with colleagues at nearby Hartwick College, involves a wide
              array of geological, environmental and chemical studies. These include studies
              of the elemental composition of metamorphic rock formations in New York and
              Montana, studies on the cycling of trace elements in environmental systems and
              specific studies of the accumulation and cycling of mercury in the Adirondack
              Region (New York). A major component of this project is the involvement of
              undergraduate students in laboratory-based research linked with field-work and
              the analysis of geological features in the field. The acquisition of this
              instrumentation will greatly enhance our suite of shared analytical
              instrumentation at SUNY Oneonta, benefiting the research of a number of faculty
              members and improving undergraduate education.
