Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              surface coating technology that will be used to create improved materials for
              regulating cell behavior for research, tissue engineering and cell therapy
              applications. For these applications, advanced materials are needed that
              display multiple types of active proteins, while preventing nonspecific protein
              adsorption. Current methods of protein immobilization do not meet these
              requirements. This project will use a previously developed technology, based on
              an end group activated Pluronic (EGAP), that tethers proteins to materials
              while preserving protein activity. In the proposed Phase I research, this
              technology will be further developed to facilitate  coimmobilization of
              multiple proteins in predetermined proportions. The specific objectives of this
              project are (1) to develop a new form of EGAP that contains a versatile protein
              binding tag, (2) to evaluate the feasibility of using this new coating to
              coimmobilize multiple biomolecules on a substrate, in controlled ratios, and
              (3)to  create materials that display two important regulators of cell growth
              and differentiation, namely fibronectin and epidermal growth factor.

The
              commercial applications of this project are in a number of areas, including
              proteomics, drug development, toxicology, environmental testing, tissue
              engineered devices and medical implants.
