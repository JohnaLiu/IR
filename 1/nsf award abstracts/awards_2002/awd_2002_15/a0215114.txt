Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project will investigate a
              biotechnological approach to rapidly detect two notorious toxin-producing
              fungi. Indoor fungal growth related to water leaks and floods can induce a
              variety of disease symptoms. The presence of some fungi, like Stachybotrys
              chartarum , can cause severe morbidity.  Unfortunately, the detection of
              harmful fungi, like Stachybotrys, has been hampered by inadequate methods. The
              proposed research will determine the feasibility of developing a rapid
              detection method for toxigenic fungi that could be used at any test site. The
              primary objective of this research is to isolate a diffusible spore molecule
              from S. chartarum spores and one from A. fumigatus spores for the development
              of an antibody-based detection kit. The molecules will be extracted in saline
              solution to mimic diffusion into lung linings and used for polyclonal antibody
              development. If successful, the
antigens will be used for monoclonal antibody
              development in a Phase II project. This will allow for the development of a
              rapid, on-site testing kit to detect potentially dangerous fungal organisms
              quickly and inexpensively.

The commercial application of this project will
              be in the area of diagnostics linked to human health and animal health.
