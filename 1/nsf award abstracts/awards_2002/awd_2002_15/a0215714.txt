In the wake of the September 11, 2001,
              terrorist attacks on 
the United States, the U.S. mathematical sciences
              community 
has become increasingly interested in contributing to
homeland
              security. Many areas of defense and intelligence 
rely naturally on advances
              in the mathematical sciences, 
and a large number of talented mathematical
              scientists have
contributed to those areas over the past 60 years and more.
              
The current climate provides an opportunity for expanding 
that pool of
              mathematical scientists who are actively involved 
in such research.  This
              award will partial support The National Research Council's Board on
              Mathematical Sciences and their Applications, in conjunction with its Committee
              on Applied 
and Theoretical Statistics, in holding a workshop, preparing 
a
              report, and posting an on-line video on "The Role of 
Mathematical Scientists
              in Homeland Defense" in order to 
stimulate the involvement of more
              mathematical scientists 
in major areas of homeland defense.
