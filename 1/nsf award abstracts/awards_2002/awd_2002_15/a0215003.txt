Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to establish
              metabolic engineering approaches to increase the production of commercially
              relevant terpenoids in mint. This program will be directed toward high priority
              areas that will allow U.S. mint growers and processors to become more
              competitive in the production of existing products such as menthol, as well as
              the ability to produce novel high value compounds. The specific objectives
              include biochemical profiling of terpenoids in 150 different mint varieties,
              production of tissue-specific cDNA libraries and generation of 15,000 Expressed
              Sequence Tags (ESTs), development of a mint DNA microarray and the use of this
              array to investigate gene expression patterns during trichome development,
              determination of protein function for one putative terpenoid biosynthetic
              enzyme, and improvement of mint transformation efficiency to the range of 
              50-100 percent. Completion of these objectives will provide a basis for the
              development of a robust system for metabolic engineering in mint that will
              allow the creation of improved lines that have enhanced production of
              commercially relevant terpenoids. This endeavor will create new products for
              U.S. mint producers and enhance their competitiveness in the world
              market.

The commercial application of this project is in the area of high
              value, plant derived compounds.
