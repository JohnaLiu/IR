Abstract    :
              This project will operate the Shelf-Basins Interactions (SBI) Project office at
              the University of Tennessee at Knoxville for a five-year period beginning in
              2002. The SBI Phase II project begins its field season in 2002 and the project
              office will be responsible for communication and coordination between the PI's
              and other national and international researchers. In addition, the project
              office will support the activities of the SBI Science Steering Committee;
              conduct outreach and public relation activities such as the maintenance of its
              web site; and coordinate meetings and workshops including two international
              workshops. The project office will also facilitate the transfer of data sets to
              the various data centers. Aside from project office activities, a logistics
              manager will conduct field support activities for the research cruises and ice
              camps. This will involve operations at Nome, Dutch Harbor, Barrow and Prudhoe
              as well as planning activities in Seattle, where the USCGC Healy is home
              ported.
