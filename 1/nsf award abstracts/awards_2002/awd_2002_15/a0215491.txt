ABSTRACT


The new research computing facility in the Department
              of
Mathematical and Computer Sciences (MCS) at the Colorado
School of Mines
              will enhance its research computing
infrastructure by providing faculty and
              graduate students
with a state-of-the-art high performance computing
              environment.
It will comprise 14 dual processor workstations, each with
1 GB
              memory and 40 GB hard drive, and a dual processor server
with 2GB memory and
              108GB hard drive. The machines will be
configured with the latest version of
              RedHat Linux. These
machines will be linked with some currently
              existing
machines at MCS to extend the local distributed network for
high
              performance computing purposes. Code development will
be completed in the
              Linux/Unix environment with programming
primarily in C/C++, FORTRAN90/95, and
              Java. In addition, MCS
has site licenses for Mathematica, Maple, Splus, and
              Matlab
to provide a full suite of symbolic computing capabilities.

The new
              research computing environment is required to solve
the complex problems being
              considered by researchers in MCS,
specifically in the areas of matrix
              decomposition algorithms,
nodal collocation for partial differential
              equations,
development of symbolic software for nonlinear
              partial
differential equations and lattices, data interpolation by
finite
              element methods, and generalized least squares
interpolation for modeling.
              Nine of the machines will form
the nucleus of a computer laboratory to be used
              by graduate
students assisting faculty members in their research. Under
the
              proposed system, the machines can be used for individual
computing by
              researchers, and also comprise a distributed
computing network. The purchase
              of dual processor computers
rather than single processor computers will double
              the number
of processors in the distributed computing network at a
              cost
increase of less than 20%. The distributed network will be
used for code
              development, compilation, debugging, and
production runs.
