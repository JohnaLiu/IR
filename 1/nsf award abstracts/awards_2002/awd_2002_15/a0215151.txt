This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project
              proposes to identify potential targets for the development of therapeutic
              agents to treat infections by parasitic nematodes. Nematode infections
              represent a serious heath concern for both humans and domesticated animals and,
              as such, represent a significant market for anthelmintic drugs. This project
              proposes to test a new approach to the discovery of anthelmintic agents.
              Divergence, LLC has identified a class of essential nematode-specific genes in
              Caenorhabditis elegans, representing a rich pool of potential targets for the
              control of human, animal and plant parsitic nematodes. Antibodies will be
              produced against a subset of proteins that are predicted to be gut-localized.
              The antibodies will be used to confirm localization of the protein and to
              challenge cultures of nematodes. Based on "hidden antigen" vaccine theory, it
              is anticipated that the antibodies against one or more of the gene-products
              proposed in this project may disrupt or impair the life cycle of the nematode.
              Completion of this Phase I project will allow a swift transition into the
              investigation of parasite genes. Expression of parasite genes introduced into
              C. elegans, which can be grown in large scale, will allow production of protein
              for the in vitro screening of peptide or small molecule libraries and for
              potential vaccine antigens.

The commercial application of this project is in
              the area of therapeutics aimed at both human and animal health.
