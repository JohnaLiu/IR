Abstract    :
              Beginning in the summer of 2003, four training institutes (2003-2006) on the
              campus of Washington University in St. Louis will be offered to bridge the
              divide between formal and empirical analysis.  The goal is to advance the study
              of methods and models and to expand the research community with cutting-edge
              expertise.  Each NSF EITM Summer Institutes is comprised of four one-week
              seminars --- a basic seminar and three advanced seminars. The instructors and
              the subjects addressed in the advanced seminars rotate over the four-year
              period of the program.  All seminars are held in the conference rooms of the
              Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy and the
              departments of political science and economics. 
Each advanced seminar
              concerns the relationship between formal models of politics and empirical
              research methods in a substantive field of political science or political
              economy. The formal models addressed span game theory, spatial theory, social
              and public choice theories, general equilibrium models, adaptive learning
              models, behavioral economic models, and hybrid approaches such as agent-based
              modeling.  Empirical methods include basic and advanced econometric techniques
              and spatial models. Students attending the NSF EITM Summer Institute also may
              attend seminars in the summer program of the Center for New Institutional
              Social Science that will have a complementary schedule. 
The faculty for the
              seminars is drawn from Washington University faculty and from faculty from
              several other universities. The Washington University faculty participating in
              the NSF EITM Summer Institute include Randall Calvert, John Carey, Lee Epstein,
              Andrew Martin, Gary Miller, Norman Schofield, Itai Sened, and Steven Smith. The
              non-Washington University faculty instructors include Charles Cameron, Keith
              Krehbiel, Kevin Quinn, Thomas Palfrey, and Rick Wilson. Seminar guests include
              Janet Box-Steffensmeier, Eric Brown, John Ferejohn, Simon Jackman, Rebecca
              Morton, Keith Poole, and Kenneth Shepsle.  25 student participants will be
              recruited on a competitive basis.  Students will be offered on-campus housing
              and will be provided travel and lodging subsidies.  An EITM committee comprised
              of Washington University faculty will administer the program.
