Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to
              develop an integrated software package for the design and optimization of novel
              Simulated Moving Bed processes for multi-component separation and purification.
              Innovative design methods, simulation software and equipment have been
              developed and tested at the laboratory-scale for a number of biological
              separations, including amino acids, sugars, a peptide drug, an antibiotic, an
              anticancer drug  and an antiviral drug. Laboratory data show that the new
              technology can produce high purity (>99%) chemicals at high yield (>99%). When
              compared to conventional batch chromatography, this technology can increase
              product yield by 5% to 15%, increase throughput per bed volume and reduce
              solvent consumption by an order of magnitude. During this Phase I Project, new
              tools for parameter estimation and cost optimization will be developed and
              integrated with  existing design and simulation tools. This will result in  a
              user-friendly interface  for the integrated package. 

The commercial
              applications of this project are in the area of recovery and purification of
              pharmaceuticals and other biochemicals. The proposed technology is expected to
              impact purification costs  in a major way, resulting in annual savings of
              several million dollars per product.
