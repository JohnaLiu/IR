Most of the world's earthquakes occur in
              subduction zones where oceanic lithosphere descends into the mantle. 
              Intermediate-depth earthquakes, which occur at 40-300 km depth, and the
              transport of water into the mantle are intimately linked to metamorphic
              reactions in the subducting lithosphere.  The researchers propose to better
              understand subduction-zone processes by integrating seismological observations
              with thermal and petrological models.  In order to test the
              dehydration-embrittlement hypothesis for intermediate-depth seismicity, the
              investigators will construct two-dimensional kinematic-dynamical thermal models
              for a set of subduction zones that span a range in subduction parameters and
              that include regions with significant along-strike variations in observed
              seismicity.  Events in global and regional seismicity data sets will be
              systematical evaluated and relocated in order to test the hypotheses that (a)
              upper seismic zones are confined to the subducting mafic crust, (b) lower
              seismic zones are related to dehydration reactions in the subducting mantle,
              and (c) the forearc mantle is aseismic.  Petrologic models of subducting
              lithosphere will be created using new phase diagrams and rock property data
              bases and the resulting layered seismic-velocity models will be tested against
              observed dispersion of seismic body waves.  The amount and distribution of
              forearc mantle hydration (serpentinization) will be quantified by integrating
              seismological observations with mineral physics calculations.
