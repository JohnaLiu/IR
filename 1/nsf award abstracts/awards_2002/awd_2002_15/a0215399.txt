This collaborative award establishes the Mid-Atlantic Center
              for Ocean Science Education Excellence to serve 4 states (Virginia, Maryland,
              New Jersey and New York).    Using a 'matrix model', the Center will scale-up
              successful individual programs at the partner institutions and establish strong
              linkages between partners.   A primary thematic focus is on the visualization
              and K-12 classroom use of data from ocean observatories and monitoring buoys
              (Rutgers, UMCES, VIMS).   Stephens Institute of Technology will contribute
              expertise in K-12 educational technology and delivery.    Hampton University
              will serve as a conduit to underrepresented minority groups and provide
              financial support for both undergraduates and graduate students.
