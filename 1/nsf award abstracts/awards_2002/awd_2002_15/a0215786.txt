Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to develop molecular dynamics simulations to
              study the interface and electrical double layer for model systems
              characteristic of copper electrodepostion baths containing additives.  The
              intent is to investigate the nature of the electrical double layer and the
              copper surface using molecular modeling under the hypothesis that this is the
              most important region for modeling electrodeposition.  The approach will employ
              recent computational advances and will explore novel methods in computational
              chemistry and molecular dynamics.  Molecular dynamics simulations will be used
              to study the interface and electrical double layer for model systems
              characteristic of copper electrodepostion baths containing additives. 
              Experimental measurements show important differences in double-layer
              capacitance, electrode polarization, and copper deposition with small changes
              in the molecular nature of the additives.  Molecular dynamics simulations may
              be applicable for directly relating observed behavior to molecular structure
              and intermolecular interactions.  The educational portion of the work will
              involve the mentoring and supervision of graduate students.  Electrodeposition
              is currently being used in the microprocessor industry for submicron
              interconnects, and this work may have an impact on these processes.
