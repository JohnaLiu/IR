Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is developing an
              advanced questions answering (QA) system with the use of innovative natural
              language processing (NLP).  The specific areas addressed by this project are:
              (1) a true open-domain, high precision QA system optimized for commercial
              deployment; (2) distributed processing that provides an unprecedented QU system
              response time; and (3) system management and reporting tools for real-time
              customer feedback.

The final product will provide accurate and short answers
              to questions asked in plain English.  The need for this capability is
              widespread in companies, government agencies, and among individuals.  The users
              may be casual questioners who ask simple factual questions, consumers who look
              for specific product features and prices, research analysis that collect
              market, finance, or business information, or professional information analysts
              such as law enforcement officials searching for very specific information
              requiring considerable expertise.
