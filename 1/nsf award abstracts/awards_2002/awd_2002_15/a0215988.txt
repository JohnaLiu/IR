Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop novel
              DNA polymerase reagents for use in current and developing DNA diagnostic
              procedures. The approach is to develop thermophilic phage DNA replicases in
              place of the currently used DNA repair enzymes. The feasibility of this
              approach was demonstrated during Phase I research. This follow on Phase II
              project will extend the methods used in Phase I to isolate additional
              activities, characterize them and develop them as reagents for various
              amplification platforms.
      The commercial applications of this project
              will be in a number of markets that use molecular analysis of DNA. They include
              the areas of biomedical research, medical testing, genetic identity testing,
              public health and agriculture.
