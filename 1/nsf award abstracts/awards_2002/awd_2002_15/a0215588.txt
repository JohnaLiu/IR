              Government:  Responding to the Unexpected

This workshop will explore the
              technical and social research issues associated with unexpected events.  These
              are occurerences, man-made or natural, for which prior planning has not been
              done, and formal response processes have not been agreed upon or established. 
              In such cases, virtual temporary organizations must be created quickly, to
              share and coordinate data, people, and resources.  Attendees will include
              engineers, emergenccy response experts, computer and information scientists,
              and social/organizational science researchers.
