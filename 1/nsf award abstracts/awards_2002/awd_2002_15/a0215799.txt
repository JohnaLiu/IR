TITLE: 
              Scholarship and Travel Grants for the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in
              Computing 2002

On October 9-12, 2002, the fourth Grace Hopper Celebration of
              Women in Computing (GHC) is being held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. 
              This international conference features talks by some of the most successful
              women in computing, technical presentations on topics of current interest, as
              well as panels, workshops, and technology innovation forums for an in-depth
              look at new issues in computing.  This grant provides travel and registration
              funding for approximately seventy-five people in computing and related fields
              who otherwise would not be able to attend.  The grants are awarded to advanced
              undergraduate and graduate students.

One of the goals of GHC is to encourage
              women to pursue and stay in the field of computer science by providing support
              for young women before they leave the pipeline.  By providing opportunities for
              them to attend GHC, they are exposed to women who are creating, improving, and
              studying advanced computer related technologies and sciences.  GHC is an
              unusual conference that focuses strongly on women in computing and is an
              excellent venue for worthwhile interactions to develop between those
              established in the field and others early in their careers.  This grant is
              expected to directly affect the careers of the attendees and to help to reverse
              the current trend showing declining numbers of women in computing.
