Abstract    :
              The Departments of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at
the University of
              Colorado will conduct research efforts
that will purchase two "compute
              engines", one for each of
two departments, that incorporate these advances.
              Among
advances in computing capacity two are crucial for the
problems of
              interest here: (i) increased size of memory now
allows for realistic
              computations of some physical phenomena
that evolve in time in three spatial
              dimensions; 
and (ii) increased computational precision makes feasible a
new
              class of fast algorithms that were infeasible otherwise.

1) A goal of one
              project is the development of fast and
accurate algorithms for solving
              practical problems in
dimensions three and higher. The two main tools in
              this
development are representations with a low separation rank
(a numerical
              version of separation of variables).

2) A goal of a second project is
              prototyping new algorithms
and developing new models for moderate to high
              Reynolds
number flows.

3) A third research project, on the behavior of a
              granular
medium in two and three dimensions, draws on the classical
kinetic
              theory, extending it to the case of inelastic
collisions, and gives explicit
              expression for macroscopic
quantities such as stress and granular
              energy.

Scientific problems of immediate interest include:
(a) geophysical
              and astrophysical fluid flows, driven by
the competing influences of planetary
              rotation, variable
gravity, and magnetic forces; (b) granular flows, such
              as
occur in avalanches or sand-piles or landslides; and (c)
electromagnetic
              wave propagation near irregularly shaped
bodies.  Aside from these immediate
              applications, a
longer-term goal is to train students to use these
              new
machines well. The University of Colorado recently
created two new
              graduate programs, designed to train
scientists and engineers in advanced
              computational methods.
These two machines will help to make these new
              programs
more effective.
