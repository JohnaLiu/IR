Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Mesa State College will acquire preparative scale
              supercritical fluid (SCF) extraction equipment, preparative scale centrifugal
              countercurrent chromatography (CCC) equipment with UV detector, and accessories
              . This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas:  a) plant
              secondary metabolites as mediators of trophic interactions in a tropical forest
              community; b) phytochemical investigation of cryptobiotic crusts and their
              alleged allelopathic interaction with non-native grasses; c) phytochemistry of
              neotropical piper species related to piper cenocladum and their role in defense
              against attine ant species; d) caterpillars of the Costa Rican rain forest; e)
              chemical mediation of trophic cascades in alfalfa and implications for
              biological control; and f) development of methodologies utilizing supercritical
              CO2 as a reaction solvent.  

The green approach to natural products
              isolation that will be developed with this equipment is timely and will benefit
              students in their future employment.  In addition, these techniques could be of
              great value to scientists in the developing nations of Latin America whose
              immense biodiversity represents a wealth of undiscovered natural products of
              enormous potential.    Therefore, scientists from Latin America who would
              otherwise not have access to SCF and CCC equipment will collaborate with the
              PI.
