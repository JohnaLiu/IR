Thompson, Ian B.

An infrared echelle spectrograph will be
              designed, fabricated, assembled and tested for use at the Magellan II telescope
              by researchers associated with the Magellan consortium. It will be capable of
              observing faint targets in the wavelength region in the UV (blueward of 3600
              Angstroms), while maintaining high resolution and full wavelength coverage of
              the visible spectrum. The design incorporates a medium order reflection
              diffraction grating in combination with a large fused-silica prism to provide
              cross dispersion. A Schmidt camera with 140-mm focal length will focus the 100
              mm collimated beam onto a low noise; back illuminated CCD optimized for UV
              coverage.
