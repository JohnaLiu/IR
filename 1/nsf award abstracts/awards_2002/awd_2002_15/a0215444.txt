Abstract    :
              Under the SCREMS program, the Department of Mathematics
at the College of
              William & Mary will purchase equipment
for the creation of a computing network
              dedicated to the
support of research in the mathematical sciences.  The
award
              will provide funds for high-bandwidth networking
equipment, high-performance
              computers for numerical
calculations, and a file server. This equipment,
              together
with desktop machines providing platforms for smaller
computations,
              will provide a numerical/file server cluster
for the faculty investigators and
              students working on a
number of research projects. This equipment will be
              used
for computationally intensive research projects spanning
a wide range of
              applied mathematics.  These include
numerical methods for engineering design,
              numerical
mathematics, computational biochemistry, and operations
research. 
              The projects specifically included in the grant
are: (1) Efficient approaches
              to the optimization of systems
governed by partial differential equations, (2)
              distance
parameterized methods for molecular conformation, (3) a
parallel
              Hessenberg QR eigenvalue algorithm, and (4) the
calculation of the exact
              distribution of the time to
traverse a stochastic activity network and the
              elimination
of resampling error in bootstrapping.   

PI Leemis and two
              former doctoral students have written
APPL (A Probability Programming
              Language). This Maple-based
language is used to compute probabilities and
              perform
operations on random variables. The size of many problems
that can be
              solved by APPL is limited by computing speed.
The speed offered by the
              hardware obtained as part of the
SCREMS grant is crucial to solving problems
              of the magnitude
encountered in practice.
