Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will investigate
              the feasibility
of incorporating diamond powder in epoxy molding compounds at
              high packing densities using optimized multi-modal distributions of diamond
              powder. The resulting thermalconductivities of these composite encapsulants are
              expected to be higher than 100 W/mK.  Selection of semiconductor molding
              compounds that exhibit high thermal conductivity are crucial in dissipating
              heat generated by high-power electronic components, particularly as feature
              sizes of future chips decrease in size. Most epoxy molding compounds used to
              encapsulate semiconductors contain fused silica (55-70% by volume) to maintain
              a
compatible thermal expansion coefficient and impart moisture resistance.
              However, the
resulting thermal conductivities of the composite compounds are
              very low (<3 W/mK). By
loading commercial molding epoxies with optimized
              diamond powder distributions, diamond volume fractions above 65% may be
              obtained in the epoxy molding liquid with a viscosity compatible with
              commercial molding processes. 

The diamond/epoxy molding compound will serve
              as a upper-limit benchmark material for thermal conductivity and will be used
              in high-performance microelectronic packaging applications where heat
              dissipation is critical.
