Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              novel method of
interrogating the structural condition and cure state of
              composite materials. It works by  propagating a sub-nanosecond voltage pulse
              along an intrinsic microwave transmission-line fabricated directly in the
              laminate. The transmission-line is formed using graphite-reinforcing fibers as
              the conducting path. Changes in pulse propagation are used to monitor changes
              in cure state, and detect various structural failures such as microcracking,
              delamination, disbonding, marcelling, and moisture absorption. The fibers are
              native to the material and constitute zero structural defect, and negligible
              cost. 

Applications include graphite composites, glass composites, composite
              joints, and
metal-adhesive joints.The commercial potential will be an
              inexpensive and spatially continuous structural-health and cure monitoring
              system with minimal invasiveness.
