Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is directed
              towards making devices that take advantage of ferroelectric's properties and
              overcome the current roadblocks in the way of commercializing ferroelectric
              devices. MicroCoating Technologies (MCT) proposes a novel concept that would
              enable ferroelectric based capacitors to be integrated with transistor
              technology. Ferroelectric devices have potential for applications such as
              tunable capacitors, phase shifters, and others. If MCT succeeds in its product
              plan, it would enable a smaller, low-noise, high transmission rate microwave
              devices and components and successfully commercialize ferroelectric
              devices.

The market for tunable microwave devices continues to grow as the
              world untethers itself from telephone lines, that is the increasing use of cell
              phones. An industry leader in wireless technology has expressed significant
              interest in ferroelectric materials, and has identified a number of areas in a
              cell phone that would benefit from variable capacitor, for example.
