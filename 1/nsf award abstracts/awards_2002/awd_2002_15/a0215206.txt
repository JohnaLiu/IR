Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I objective of this project
              is to develop an integrated wafer-scale, high-speed tunable filter technology
              for high-bit-rate fiber optic networks. Specifically, the feasibility of
              developing a wafer-scale array of innovative Fabry-Perot tunable filters for
              use in either the transmitter or the receiver of a communications system is
              explored. The operating voltage of the filters is designed to be in the range
              of 0 - 40 volts, the scanning times are less than 0.1 milliseconds and the
              filtering wavelength region between 2.5 and 5 m. In Phase I, the innovative
              tunable filter will first be prototyped in a small array (88 pixels), and in
              Phase II it will be scaled to a 3232 module that will be driven by an active
              matrix high voltage VLSI chip. In the Phase II work these filter arrays will be
              integrated directly onto the surface of VCSEL arrays and detector arrays (to be
              supplied by one of our corporate partners) to form a pre-aligned rugged and
              compact package. 
     This novel MEMS-based tunable filter array will find
              applications in fiber-optic telecommunication systems, and in low-cost,
              high-performance remote sensing instruments and spectrometers
