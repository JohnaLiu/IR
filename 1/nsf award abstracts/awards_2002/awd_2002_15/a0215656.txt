Abstract    :
              The Space Studies Board (SSB) of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences requests
              funding to be used for travel grants for young scientists from developing
              countries (India, China, South America and nations of the former Soviet Union)
              and from within the United States who are involved in solar-terrestrial
              research (e.g., aeronomy, the magnetosphere, the sun, the interplanetary
              medium, and the upper atmosphere) to attend the World Space Congress 2002.  The
              World Space Congress is a joint scientific/technical meeting of the Committee
              on Space Research (COSPAR) and the International Astronautical Federation
              (IAF).  The funding will be directed to the Committee on Space Research
              (COSPAR), which will administer the grants.
