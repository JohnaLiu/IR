This Small Business Innovation Research  project proposes  to
              develop novel fluidization systems that are needed for synthesis of
              nano-encapsulated insulin particles for pulmonary drug delivery applications.
              By coating the insulin particle with very thin (10-50 nm) layer of
              biodegradable polymers such as polylactic acid (PLA), the sustained release
              characteristics of insulin can be significantly altered. The unique method has
              several advantages over conventional methods including low polymer loading, and
              impurity-free processing. The nano-encapsulation method involves using laser
              ablation thin film deposition technique to coat drug particles which are
              fluidized in the gas phase. This Phase I project will develop batch scale
              fluidization systems which are capable of fluidizing up to 1 kg of particles at
              a time.

The commercial applications of this project are in the area of
              pharmaceutical drug delivery.
