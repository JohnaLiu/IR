Abstract    :
              The Colorado School of Mines will to establish an Environmental Scanning
              Electron Microscope (ESEM) laboratory to meet the growing research and
              education needs of the CSM campus. The proposed ESEM laboratory will be a
              shared-use facility, with extensive participation from the majority of
              departments across campus. The facility will augment the recently established
              electron microscopy center in the materials science department, providing a
              focal point to enrich undergraduate and graduate education. 

In addition, it
              will serve as a resource facility for local industry.  The proposed to acquire
              an ESEM equipped with temperature controlled sample stages  (both heated and
              cooled), as well as energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) for elemental mapping.
               This configuration was chosen as the optimum with respect to maximizing
              versatility at a reasonable cost.  An ESEM retains the performance advantages
              of a conventional SEM, but removes the high vacuum (<10-6 torr) constraints.
              The ESEM derives its name from its ability to manipulate the sample environment
              through a range of pressure (10-6. 20 torr), temperature (-20 -  1000 degrees
              C), and gas composition. The flexibility offered by this research will allow it
              to find widespread use on the CSM campus.
