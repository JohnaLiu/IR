Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Dorota
              Abramovitch and Thomas Kozel of Anderson College will acquire a gas
              chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection that will be used to support
              the integration of research and courses in environmental/analytical chemistry
              into the undergraduate curriculum.  Anderson College is an undergraduate
              institution.  The PIs will establish a research effort in analytical
              biochemistry that will involve undergraduates and emphasize environmental and
              green chemistry.  One project involves monitoring the chemistry, flora and
              fauna of a local creek acquatic ecosystem.  Eventually, they plan to carry out
              water, sludge and soil analyses for organic contaminants and heavy metals.  The
              instrument will also be used in a number of courses.
