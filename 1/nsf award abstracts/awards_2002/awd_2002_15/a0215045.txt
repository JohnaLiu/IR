Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              pulse measurement device intended to fully characterize optical pulses used in
              fiber optic telecommunication systems.  Next generation optical networks will
              use 40 Gbit/s rates requiring pulse widths of less than ~25 picoseconds.  At
              this pulse width, dispersion compensation is required to obtain transmission
              distances of greater than 25 km.  In addition, nonlinear optical effects will
              complicate system development by adding intensity-dependent dispersion. 
              Optical network designers are anticipating these problems by developing active
              dispersion compensation.  However, a requirement of active dispersion
              compensation is accurate measurements of pulse intensity and phase within an
              optical network.  Then, corrections to the dispersion compensation can be
              determined exactly.  A pulse characterization device is proposed that will be
              self-contained, have only one fiberized input, be rugged and easy to
              use.

This technology has commercial potential as a diagnostic for
              telecommunications research and as a diagnostic for optical network design.  As
              optical networks move beyond the OC-192 standard, active dispersion
              compensation will be required.  This technology can used in research
              applications and can be part of a feedback mechanism to actively control
              dispersion in functioning optical networks.
