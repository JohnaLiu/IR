Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to
              develop innovative visible blind UV detectors based on a novel metal-oxide
              system that is analogous to Gallium Aluminum Nitride (GaN). It is based on a
              wide band gap oxide system that is realized by alloying two primary oxide
              compounds, exhibiting a wider and tunable band gap, creating semiconductor
              materials which have energy gaps from 3.3 eV to 7.9 eV with high radiation
              hardness. The project investigator has already patented the concept of making
              and applying tailorable band gap oxide materials. The goal of this proposal is
              to study the feasibility of growing wide band gap metal-oxides and ultraviolet
              detectors on low cost substrates such as glass, polyimide, and silicon for
              commercialization of cost effective products. 

This technology can be
              extended to produce large format detector arrays and which can improve their
              reliability. Other areas where GaN detectors can be used are in
              telecommunications, chemical sensing, and homeland security.
