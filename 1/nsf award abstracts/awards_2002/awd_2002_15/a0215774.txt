Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah  will acquire a wide-bore 600
              MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out
              studies on a) measurements of chemical shift tensors in natural products, ionic
              compounds, aerosols and soots, b) quadrupolar interactions in shift tensors and
              couplings in biologically important molecules, and c) spin exchange in
              polarized noble gases.   

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is
              the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the
              structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
              characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
              dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to
              state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact
              in a number of areas including drug development and advanced materials.
