Abstract    :
              This funding will allow Florida International University (FIU) to contribute a
              key technology component to the 2002 AMPATH StarLight Rio Grid Workshop in
              Brazil.  FIU has lead the nation in establishing research networking
              connectivity to South Amercan through the AMPATH Project.  A corporate donation
              has been made to provide high-speed connectivity between StarLight in Chicago
              and AMPATH in Miami and thus from Miami and to Rio.  The proposal forms a
              partnership with three scientific applications.  This will bring an
              un-paralleled level of network services to them for an appropriate tuning
              period and then for the length of the conference.  The workshop has a high
              likelyhood of inciting subsequent non U.S. investment in networking
              infrastructure that would benefit currently challenged U.S. programs.
