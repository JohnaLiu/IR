Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to improve understanding of the heterogeneous
              chemical kinetics of atmospheric particles.  The P.I.s will study
              laboratory-generated atmospheric particles composed of cores of elemental
              carbon coated with organic layers and determine the chemical kinetics of
              reactions in the layers with ozone.  The specific goals of the research are:
              (1) to generate particles composed of cores of elemental carbon with organic,
              (2) to determine the chemical kinetics of reactions in the layers with ozone,
              as dependent on the qualitative layering characteristics, such as thickness and
              chemical type, (3) to quantify interactions of the layers and the ozone
              reaction kinetics with relative humidity, and (4) to investigate the response
              of the aerosol mass spectrometer as a qualitative and quantitative analytical
              instrument for these types of organic particles. 
	
The broader impacts of
              this work will be an improved understanding of heterogeneous processes in the
              atmosphere that are important for human health, climate change, and air
              quality.  This project will also foster international collaborations and
              provide opportunities for graduate training.
