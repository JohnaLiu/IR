Abstract    :
              The National Plant Genome Initiative was launched in FY1998 as a long-term
              project to explore the structure and function of plant genomes. Its goals are
              to ensure that useful properties of plants can be understood, improved, and
              ultimately harnessed to address national needs, including agriculture,
              nutrition, energy, environment, and health. A five-year plan was developed to
              guide the program during its inauguration.

The program has made significant
              progress to date, and the NPGI must begin to develop objectives for its next
              phase.  To provide input to this planning process, the National Research
              Council will form a study group consisting of experts in genomics, plant
              biology, informatics, and other relevant fields of science.  The study group
              will organize a 3 day workshop to: (1) identify key scientific questions that
              might be answered in the next five years; (2) consider the relative priorities
              of additional sequencing, functional genomics and proteomics within the
              initiative; (3) examine the potential to use bioinformatics and biological
              tools that are available or emerging, and; (4) describe the tools,
              infrastructure, and human resources that are needed to successfully address key
              scientific questions identified by the workshop participants.

Following the
              workshop, the study group will write a report summarizing its assessment of the
              key scientific directions and recommending priorities for the plant genome
              initiative for the next five years. The report will be published and made
              available on the web.  The report will be delivered by the end of August
              2002.
