Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Kent State University will  acquire an imaging
              Fourier transform infrared (FTIF) spectrometer.  This instrument will support
              research in a number of areas, including a) the development of IR imaging for
              monolayers at the air/water interface and the characterization of
              phosphoinositide/protein interactions; b) the investigation of liquid
              crystal/polymer interactions; c) the characterization of biofilm formation in
              the environment; and d) the development of new methods of multi-dimensional
              data analysis.  

The general effectiveness of Fourier transform
              spectroscopic techniques in academic and industrial research has been firmly
              established.  Many advanced spectroscopic courses now routinely include the
              teaching of FT spectroscopy. Imaging technology is extremely important for the
              characterization of advanced materials in industrial research, and focal plane
              array IR imaging is becoming increasingly popular in industrial analytical
              laboratories.
