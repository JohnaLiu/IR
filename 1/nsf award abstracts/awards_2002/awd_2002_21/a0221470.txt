This is a collaborative proposal between Principal
              Investigators at the University of California - San Diego and Washington State
              University.  They will develop a large-volume atmospheric archive at the margin
              of the Greenland ice sheet in order to test two competing hypotheses for the
              cause of the abrupt increases in atmospheric methane concentration that
              punctuated the last glacial period.  The main objective is to measure the
              carbon-14 (14C) content of atmospheric methane before and after these events.
              These events have been attributed to 1) destabilization of sedimentary methane
              hydrate (clathrate) or 2) increased methane production in terrestrial wetlands
              due to warmer and wetter climatic conditions. The carbon-14 content of
              atmospheric methane should distinguish between clathrate and wetland sources
              because clathrates are made from carbon-14-free sedimentary organic matter,
              whereas the carbon-14 content of wetland-derived methane is essentially the
              same as that of atmospheric carbon dioxide. This test is important because the
              wetland hypothesis has been used to infer large-scale tropical abrupt climate
              change, with broad implications for our understanding of the potential for
              rapid change in both past and future climates. The main obstacle to this
              measurement is that it requires ~200 liters of air, much more than is available
              from ice core samples. This work will use ice that outcrops due to ablation and
              ice flow at the margin of the Greenland ice sheet at a location called
              Pakitsoq, enabling virtually unlimited sample size. Preliminary fieldwork has
              demonstrated that ice of the appropriate age (11,000-15,000 years ago) can be
              found, and that it is not contaminated with respect to methane or gas isotopes,
              by comparison with the known atmospheric record from the Greenland Ice Sheet
              Project 2 (GISP2) ice core. Ice of Eemian (last Interglacial) age also appears
              to be present at this site, and this work will use gas measurements to
              establish the chronology of the entire margin ice section including a thick
              Holocene section.
