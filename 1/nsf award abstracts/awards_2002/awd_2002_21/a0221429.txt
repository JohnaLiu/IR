Abstract    :
              	This dissertation investigates how blind and partially sighted peoples'
              inability to respond to visible, non-vocal gestures leads to disruptions in
              interactional encounters.  A consistent set of problems occur during everyday
              social interaction between sighted and visually impaired/blind people. 
              Conversational analysis will explore how interactional repairs (e.g., recycled
              turns) maintain the achievement of meaning in spite of these problems.  The
              research will not only analyze how these particular interactions are
              negotiated, but will demonstrate the role of taken-for-granted visible gestures
              in interpersonal communication among sighted people.   Participant observation
              and interviews with partially sighted/blind people will develop a broad
              description of interactional problems.  Videotaped interaction will be used to
              analyze the conversational process of disruption and repair in more detail.
