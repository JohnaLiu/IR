Abstract    :
              	This dissertation will investigate the joint personality and neighborhood
              determinants of juvenile and adolescent antisocial behvaior.  Data come from
              the Rural Substance Use and Violence Project, a longitudinal survey of middle
              school students in Kentucky.  Part of that survey included measures of the
              "Five Factor Model" of personality; data on the child's neighborhood context
              are also available.  Analyses using multilevel models will focus on whether
              each determinant has independent effects on antisocial behavior and whether the
              two interact so that both are jointly necessary.   These statistical analyses
              will be supplemented by qualitative data from school personnel including their
              reactions to the survey instrument and the statistical results as well as an
              assessment of the school atmosphere.
