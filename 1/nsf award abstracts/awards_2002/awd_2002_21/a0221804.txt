Abstract    :
              The Biocomplexity in the Environment (BE): Coupled Biogeochemical Cycles (CBC)
              project will investigate the complex relationships between large-scale climatic
              forcing factors, local climatic changes across the region, salmon population
              dynamics both before and after European cultural impacts, and vegetation and
              lake-ecosystem responses to these changes. Dr. Abbott, and colleagues, Bradley
              and Francis (both from U Mass, Amherst), and Finney (U Alaska), will analyze
              high-resolution sediment records from the region to provide detailed records
              over large temporal and spatial scales. The two thrusts of the research are to
              produce multi-proxy records of moisture and temperature variations during the
              last 12,000 years from lakes in the Pacific Northwest and reconstruct salmon
              abundance at one of these sites. The project will produce a sub-decadal to
              century-scale climate history of the Pacific Northwest, and advance
              understanding of its biogeochemical cycles. The project will focus on the
              response of salmon populations and lake-ecosystems to climate change. The
              broader impact of this research would be in the area of salmon management and
              restoration in the Pacific Northwest.
