This award supports a total of 37 participants from the
              United States, South and East Asia, and the Americas in a US-Africa Workshop on
              "Achieving Public Understanding of Science in Developing Countries," scheduled
              for December 5-9, 2002, in Cape Town, South Africa.  There will be a total of
              approximately 60 participants, which will also include attendees from Europe
              and Australia.  A special effort has been made to include participants from
              developing countries throughout the world. The co-organizers are Professor
              Bruce Lewenstein, with the Department of Communication at Cornell University,
              and Ms. Marina Joubert, with the Department of Science Communication at the
              Foundation for Education, Science, and Technology (FEST), Pretoria South
              Africa.  The workshop participants will explore issues on the public
              understanding of science, and build networks and collaborations that can lead
              to innovative projects and research.

 The meeting will bring together
              knowledgeable practitioners of public communication of science and technology,
              scholars, and scientists.  They reflect a great diversity of expertise, with
              some coming from the electronic or print media fields, while others are
              experienced in presenting research to the public. The meeting will explore two
              cross-cutting issues: 1) the difference between public understanding of science
              and public understanding of research, and 2) the differences between a
              traditional deficit model of science communication and newer contextual, lay
              knowledge/expertise, and participation models of science communication.  Prior
              to the workshop each participant will produce an "op-ed piece" about the
              challenges and opportunities for achieving public understanding of science in
              developing countries.  These position statements will be circulated to all
              participants in preparation for discussion during the meeting.  As an outcome
              of the workshop a guide will be produced for use in the development of a
              "Southern African Science Communication Network."  Results will be disseminated
              through professional journals and via a web site.

The project supports the
              participation of two junior investigators from the United States, and one from
              Nigeria.  

The Office of International Science and Engineering, the
              Directorate for Education and Human Resources, and the Division of Social and
              Economic Sciences jointly support this award.
