Abstract    :
              	This dissertation compares the process of racial identification among first
              generation Dominican and Puerto Rican immigrants in New York with racial
              identification among these groups in their countries of origin.  Latin
              Americans tend to see race as a continuum with many more categories than are
              accepted in the United States.  For immigrants from these racially
              heterogeneous countries, racial identification should be affected by cultural
              contexts in both the U.S. and their countries of origin.  In depth interviews
              will ask about attitudes toward race, the perceptions of how their group is
              viewed by others, and the respondents' systems of racial classification.  
              Changes in racial identification because of immigration should be related to
              the respondents' social networks and economic outcomes.
