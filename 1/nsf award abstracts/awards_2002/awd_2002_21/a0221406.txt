The distribution of melt and solid within partially
              molten regions of the Earth's mantle is one of the key parameters controlling
              the dynamics, properties and compositions of these regions.  Field
              observations, experiments and theory all suggest that melt should be
              distributed in some form of channelized network at depth but the physical
              mechanisms for producing these networks are still not well understood. This
              project will develop new tools to investigate mechanical instabilities for flow
              localization based on fluid flow in deformable permeable media with strongly
              variable solid shear viscosity.  These tools will complement existing models
              for flow localization due to reactive melt transport.  Developing accurate flow
              solvers in heterogeneous media is numerically quite challenging, however, the
              investigation will be guided by recent experiments from David Kohlstedt's
              laboratory (U. Minnesota) on flow induced melt localization that provide clear
              and diagnostic tests for the theory.  The opportunity to directly combine
              theory and experiment is rare and the investigators plan to work closely in
              consultation with the Kohlstedt group.  However, the initial objective of this
              project is the development of the needed numerical tools.  Once developed and
              validated with the experimental results, they will be used to extrapolate the
              experimental results to larger scales and investigate geologically relevant
              systems such as melt transport beneath mid-ocean ridges and island arcs.
