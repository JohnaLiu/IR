Abstract    :
              Award is for a coordinated seismic and coring study of the Storegga Slide on the
              Norwegian Margin. The Storegga slide developed in sediments thought to have
              contained substantial amounts of gas hydrate. Examining this slide area will
              test the hypothesis that submarine landslides can release methane from hydrates
              into the oceans and/or atmosphere and thereby affect climate. The study will
              test three major hypotheses; 1) How much gas hydrate is present in the Storegga
              region, 2) did methane escape as a result of the slide, and if so, how much? 3)
              does hydrate dissociation promote submarine landslides?  A  43 day cruise of
              the R/V Ewing will acquire high resolution seismic reflection data, three
              component ocean bottom seismic data and jumbo piston cores.
