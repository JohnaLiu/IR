This Pan America Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) award,
              jointly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department
              of Energy (DOE), is being organized by Dr. Daniel Inman of the Virginia
              Polytechnic Institute and State University in collaboration with Dr. Vincent
              Lopes of the Universidade Estadual Paulista. The proposed activity will take
              place in Florianopolis and Santa Catarina, Brazil in November 2003, and will
              bring together well-qualified researchers in diverse disciplines related to
              damage prognosis. The main objective is to involve forty to fifty postdoctoral,
              advanced graduate students, senior scientists and engineers in a two-week
              intensive course that highlights interdisciplinary efforts in fields related to
              damage prognosis. The key unifying theme of the proposed course is to tie in
              three areas: 1) hardware to implement prognosis; 2) damage mechanics to model
              and understand the physical principles of prognosis; and 3) algorithms to make
              appropriate predictions, to form a Prognostic System and understand the nature
              of the interface between the three areas.
