Biological diversity and its function are focal areas in
              ecology, and the relationship between plant diversity and ecosystem function
              has been intensively studied. By contrast, few studies have addressed the role
              of mycorrhizal fungi and their diversity even though they are presumed to be
              critical in plant nutrient uptake and nutrient retention. This grant focuses
              attention on differential nitrogen (N) use among symbiotic fungi in the roots
              of ericaceous dwarf shrubs in the arctic. The researchers will address the role
              of diverse fungi in plants ability to access organic and inorganic N sources.
              Ericoid mycorrhizal (ERM) symbiosis may be the key to the abundance of
              ericaceous shrubs in arctic ecosystems as their fungal symbionts likely utilize
              organic N sources thus facilitating plant organic N uptake. Knowledge of ERM
              diversity and its function is a necessary foundation for understanding arctic
              and boreal ecosystem processes. This knowledge is especially crucial in arctic
              ecosystems where supply of inorganic N is low and plant N limitation is strong.
