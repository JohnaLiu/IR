Abstract    :
              This project seeks to combine fieldwork with a systematic review of the
              published literature to define environmental governance ostensibly, identify
              its underlying normative principles, clarify exactly what the key-words, such
              as "democracy," and "sustainability" mean operationally, and lay down criteria
              to measure the success of developmental schemes that embrace the environmental
              governance model. It also seeks to analyze what it takes to re-tool state
              expert communities and institutionalize a new set of practices and procedures
              in state bureaucracies. Moreover, it seeks to discover what is entailed in
              scaling up technological and institutional design that have been successful in
              micro contexts to larger scales, or to transfer successful models across
              cultural contexts. Last, but by no means the least, it seeks to address the
              question of conflict resolution: how, in the process of engendering such
              paradigmatic change and institutionalize environmental governance are the
              inevitable political conflicts to be negotiated at various levels of state
              bureaucracies and technocracies? Research will focus on three sectors: forests
              and biodiversity, water, and renewable energy, in India, which offers a large
              number of case studies in the context of a vibrant democracy. 
Combining the
              insights of Political Ecology and Science and Technology Studies, the proposed
              program aims to be a landmark analysis of the environmental governance
              paradigm, provide a path breaking study of the role of expertise in the
              environment and development in the third world, and thereby add to the
              theoretical understanding of democracy and technology.
