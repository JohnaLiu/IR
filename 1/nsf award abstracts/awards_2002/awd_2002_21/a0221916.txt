TITLE: ITR Large Scale
              Quantum Mechanical Simulations of Nonomechanics


Large scale quantum
              mechanical simulations of nanomechanics of carbon
nanotubes involving atoms in
              excess of 10,000 is underway using a
collaborative effort involving material
              and computer
scientists. Parallel software tools are being developed to
              accomplish
this.  The tools are based on a novel pipelined, parallel
              architecture
designed to harness grid computing.  The goal of the simulations
              is to
study the potential benefits of nanomechanical applications of
              carbon
nanotubes and use the results to guide experimental
              investigations.
