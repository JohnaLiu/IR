Abstract    :
              Since 1991 NOAA/PMEL has monitored seismicity in the NE Pacific using Navy SOSUS
              arrays, and since 1966 using an autonomous hydrophone array in the equatorial
              Pacific.  This project is an effort to use analyze these data to address
              questions related to the first-order patterns in seismicity, stress transfer
              and earthquake interactions.
