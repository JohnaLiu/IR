This is a 12 month project submitted by Dr. Robert
              Eisenberg, Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center to request funds for 12
              U.S. participants to attend a five-day U.S.-China workshop on introduction of
              physicists and chemists to ions in protein channels, to be held in Nanjing and
              Chongqing October 12-18, 2002. This is an interdisciplinary workshop to
              introduce physicists and chemists to relevant problems in biology.   Bringing
              these scientists together to focus on problems in a different discipline, with
              their counterpart researchers from East Asia is a laudable goal.  The NSF
              provides partial support to the U.S. participants to attend this conference. 
              The National Science Foundation of China, Nanjing University of Chemical
              Technology, the Hong Kong University, and the University of Utah also provide
              support to this workshop.
