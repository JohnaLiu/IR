Abstract    :
              

For proper functioning of the nervous system, each nerve cell must assemble
              the molecular machinery required for the release of its signal, the
              neurotransmitter, at the precise location on its target cell where the signal
              can be received and a response produced.  This precise alignment between the
              release machinery of nerve terminals and the reception molecules of their
              targets presents a challenge not only for its construction and growth but also
              for its maintenance.  The precision of this organization between nerve cells
              and targets is beautifully illustrated at the frog neuromuscular junction where
              a linear array of release sites in nerve terminals is separated by distinct
              nonrelease domains.  Using the frog motor nerve terminal, Dr. Connor's
              laboratory discovered that cytoskeletal molecules including F-actin, a molecule
              involved in the structural support and movement of cells and organelles, is
              concentrated in nonrelease domains.  The long range goal of Dr. Connor's
              project is to determine the role of the cytoskeleton and F-actin in fundamental
              processes of nerve terminals that may occur in nonrelease domains: the
              recycling of the neurotransmitter release machinery and the stabilization of
              nerve terminals at their targets.  Partial funding is provided to Dr. Connor's
              laboratory to launch initial experiments using state-of-the-art, electron
              microscope tomography to construct a high resolution, three-dimension map of
              the cytoskeleton in nonrelease domains of nerve terminals.  Further, this will
              provide training opportunities for graduate students in the current techniques.
