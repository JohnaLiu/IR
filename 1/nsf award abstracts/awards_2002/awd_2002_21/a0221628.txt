Abstract    :
              This is a three-year research project to understand the role of convection in
              forcing equatorial waves, and the effects of these waves on the dynamics of the
              middle atmosphere.  The tool to be adopted for this investigation is the
              National Center for Atmospheric Research's Whole Atmosphere Climate/Chemistry
              Model (WACCM), a comprehensive numerical model spanning the range of altitude
              from the Earth's surface to the lower thermosphere.  The focus of the project
              are the equatorial waves, forced in the tropical troposphere by transient
              convection heating, that propagate upward into the stratosphere, mesosphere,
              and lower thermosphere.  It is expected that this project will have broad
              impact on theoretical, numerical and observational aspects of wave propagation,
              dynamics, and chemical composition of the middle atmosphere.
