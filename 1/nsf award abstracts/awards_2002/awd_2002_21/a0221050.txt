Abstract    :
              This collaborative project between the laboratories at Yale (Ruddle and Wagner)
              and Boston University (Amemiya) seeks to understand the evolutionary
              diversification of the vertebrate body plan in molecular and developmental
              terms.  Key organisms such as the lamprey, horned shark, and the primitive bony
              fish Bichir will be major subjects for research.  A primary approach to the
              problem of the vertebrate radiation will be to isolate and sequence the Hox
              gene clusters that govern pattern formation on the primary and secondary body
              axes.  In particular, the investigators will be interested in determining copy
              number of the clusters in the selected species, the identification of conserved
              non-coding elements that may serve as regulatory elements, the history of Hox
              cluster duplications and their possible role in vertebrate evolution.  Finally,
              the investigators want to test the neutralist theory with respect to the
              duplication and diversification of gene complexes governing body plan.
