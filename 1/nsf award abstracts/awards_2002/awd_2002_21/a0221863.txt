Abstract    :
              This award will be used for a new state-of-the-art Nikon microscope with
              transmitted-reflected light, fluorenscence, phase contrast and Nomarski
              capabilities for geologic and microbiologic studies.  The scope will also have
              high-resolution color and black and white digital cameras, and an advanced
              image analyses system that will allow documentation and analyses of spatially
              co-registered petrographic and microbiological observaions.  Cost share
              provided by UW is about 14%.  The new scope is needed for research focused on
              the linkages among geological and microbiological processes within submarine
              environments.  Fundamental to understanding these complex systems is the
              ability to make detailed, integrated, microbiological observations in the
              context of the rocks that host these unique communities.
