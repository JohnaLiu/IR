This rural sociology Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant
              examines the beef livestock sector, which has remained small scale and
              decentralized relative to that of the poultry and hog industries.  The research
              seeks to increase our understanding of adaptations that allow family-owned
              businesses to compete in a restructuring industry. More generally, the co-PI
              will address the question of whether the persistence of small-scale beef
              production derive from capacity to remain competitive or reflect  "resistance"
              to dominant trends in society.   The project combines quantitative and
              qualitative research.  Government statistics from the US Department of
              Agriculture, Census of Agriculture and American Meat Institute will be
              integrated to determine direction and forces of structural change in beef
              production.  Approximately thirty in-depth structured interviews will be
              conducted with farmers in three regions of the US, and other key informants
              (typically persons at other stages of the beef commodity chain, including input
              and service suppliers, processors, and retailers). These will provide
              information on the dynamics of structural change and household
              decision-making.
