Abstract    :
              0221057 Smyth

A sequence of direct numerical simulation (DNS) experiments
              designed to extend earlier two-dimensional results to more general ocean flows
              will be performed. Turbulence evolution will be simulated in a variety of
              initial flows in which density changes in thin layers (compared with velocity)
              and oscillatory instability results. The physics of turbulence will be studied
              in detail, and turbulence statistics will be compared with DNS of
              Kelvin-Hemholtz billows, with laboratory experiments on Holmboe waves, and with
              turbulent events observed in the ocean as has been done for Kelvin-Helmholtz
              waves. Besides adding directly to the knowledge of oscillatory instabilities in
              the ocean, diagnostics that will permit the identification of instability
              classes (e.g. Kelvin-Helmholtz or Holmboe) more clearly in future observational
              studies will be defined.
