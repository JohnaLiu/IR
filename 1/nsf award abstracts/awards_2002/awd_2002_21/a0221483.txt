Abstract    :
              	This dissertation investigates the rapid expansion of the casino industry in
              the United States and South Africa.  These cases differ in industry regulation
              and competitive structure: competitive, privatized casinos in South Africa, and
              monopolistic, regulated ones in California.  While both casinos were
              legitimated through their potential to develop indigenous peoples, different
              conceptions of development by casino supporters have led to different
              structures and regulation.  The research will investigate the consequences of
              these different origins and structures with ethnographic fieldwork at both
              sites.  Three issues will be central: financial relations between the
              corporations and indigenous peoples, management-worker relations, and marketing
              strategies with consumers.
