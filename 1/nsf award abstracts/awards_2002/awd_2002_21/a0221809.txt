ABSTRACT

The PI's propose to study the
              formation of colloidal arrays within emulsion droplets to template 'supraballs'
              (which they define as solid spheres containing arrays of colloidal spheres or
              holes templated by colloidal spheres). Some of the goals include achievement of
              better control over suprasphere sizes by optimizing a previously developed
              break-off process and by employing a microfluidic device; understanding of
              hole/colloid ordering in supraballs and emulsification of colloidal particles;
              and understanding of optical properties of supraballs (light diffusion). In
              addition, the PI will attempt to prepare directional colloids within emulsion
              droplets, intending to assemble these in non close-packed structures which are
              advantageous for photonic materials.
