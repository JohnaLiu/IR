              ABSTRACT

Objectives and Methods: The goal of this proposal is to determine
              how the biodiversity and activity of specific living microbes and/or microbial
              communities are required to create the terraced architectures universally
              observed in high-temperature and low-temperature carbonate spring deposits.
              Results will provide a fundamental knowledge of microbe-water-mineral
              interactions during carbonate precipitation that are needed to more accurately
              reconstruct the history of microbial life on earth and other planets. This
              project advances the field of  biocomplexity by combining geological studies,
              microbial rDNA and gene analyses and quantitative modeling to provide a
              detailed geobiological account of carbonate terrace formation. The integrated
              multidisciplinary research and educational aspects of this project meet a
              national need to train personnel for future geobiology and biocomplexity
              studies.

The project is headed by a unique interdisciplinary research team
              with specific expertise in geology, microbiology, and physics. Project
              milestones include:1) performing in situ crystallization experiments to
              determine the form and chemistry of travertine deposited when the microbes have
              been UV-irradiated, a sterilization technique that will leave the other
              fundamental physical and chemical conditions of the spring drainage outflow
              relatively unchanged; 2) documenting associations between calcite crystal
              growth form, distribution and chemistry with microbial form, diversity and
              metabolic activity; and 3)quantitative modeling of carbonate terrace formation
              using stochastic differential equations to describe the combined effects of
              geological and biological processes.

Mammoth Hot Springs is the most
              appropriate natural laboratory in the world for conducting the proposed
              research. Although CO2 degassing and decreasing temperatures strongly influence
              the spring water chemistry, significant biological controls on travertine
              crystal form and isotope chemistry have recently been quantitatively
              documented.
Mammoth Hot Springs uniquely offers:1) precipitation rates as high
              as 5 mm/day that allow short-duration in situ crystallization experiments in a
              regime of coupled biological and physical influences;2) the full spectrum of
              high-to low-temperature carbonate precipitates at one site;3) long-term
              familiarity of the study site by the PI 's who have all required research
              permits in hand; and 4)the only easily accessible hot spring complex in the
              world protected in its natural state.

Intellectual Merit: The main question
              addressed is whether the presence of terraced carbonate architecture is prima
              facie evidence for the presence of microbial activity. Results from this study
              will permit the identification of microbiologically influenced crystallization
              in other modern and ancient high-temperature and low-temperature terraced
              carbonate spring deposits. The techniques employed in the quantitative modeling
              provide a first principles understanding of significant geological features
              from a physical and biological perspective. Of equal importance, the results
              from this study will establish a systematic and quantitative toolkit to
              identify microbial influence during carbonate deposition that can be used in a
              wide variety of other important terrestrial, marine, and burial environments on
              earth and other planets.
Broader Impacts: This systems-level understanding of
              the interaction between biological and geological processes and resultant
              conceptual approaches will provide learning opportunities at all levels from
              postgraduate to K-12, as well as to the general public. The program to train
              personnel in biocomplexity studies will include undergraduates, graduate
              students, and postdocs, international student exchange with the University of
              Siena in Italy, web-based curriculum development for Geobiology courses, and
              the development of a formal Geobiology program at Illinois. This project
              enhances public awareness of the need for biocomplexity studies through museum
              displays, brochures, and interpretive trail signs for the Canyon and Mammoth
              Hot Springs Visitor Centers in Yellowstone National Park, which will be seen
              and used by over 3 million park visitors each year.
