The
              proposal requests support for 10 U.S. participants to a 3-day workshop to be
              held in Pusan, Korea.  This U.S.-Korea Joint Workshop is about Smart
              Infrastructural Systems.  Objectives of the workshop are to assess the current
              state of theory and practice and to foster communication across a variety of
              technical disciplines representing theoretical and experimental research as
              well as design, for a broad range of applications; to stimulate future
              cooperative research and development in subjects of common need and importance;
              to evaluate the results of Korea's civil  infrastructure research program and
              their practical application to U.S. engineering practice; and to continue to
              build the long-term bilateral scientific relationship
