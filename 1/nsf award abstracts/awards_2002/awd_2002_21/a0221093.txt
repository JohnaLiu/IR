Abstract    :
              	This dissertation uses Health and Retirement Study data to investigate the role
              of exercise in explaining racial and gender disparities in health among older
              Americans.  Exercise can be regarded as a type of investment that people make
              in their own health.  These health investments are hypothesized to be affected
              by the other kinds of capital that people possess: economic, social, and
              cultural.  Multiple dimensions of each of these forms of capital will be tested
              for their relationships with exercise. Racial/ethnic and gender differences in
              exercise may be explained in part by varying levels of social, economic, and
              cultural capital.
