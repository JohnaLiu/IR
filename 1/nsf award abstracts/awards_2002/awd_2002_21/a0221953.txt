Abstract    :
              A marine reflection survey was conducted over the submarine flanks of Kilauea
              and Moana Loa volcanoes, Hawaii, in 1998.  Shot data from this survey were
              recorded by the permanent on-land seismic array maintained by the Hawaii
              Volcanoes Observatory.  Raypaths for arrivals over the survey region sample a
              large volume of the volcanic edifice and subjacent ocean crust, with densest
              coverage at the offshore-onshore transition.  These data will be processed and
              inverted to obtain a 3D tomographic image of the velocity structure of the
              volcano.
