Abstract    :
              This award provides support for student attendance at the annual meeting of the
              Division of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics (DAMOP) of the American
              Physical Society.  The meeting will be held at the College of William and Mary
              from 28 May through 1 June, 2002. This is the principal meeting covering
              principles of AMO physics held each year, and this award gives students the
              opportunity to participate in DAMOP sponsored events.   A new event for this
              particular conference is a special pre-conference symposium for students to
              hear special presentations on topics of particular DAMOP interest.
