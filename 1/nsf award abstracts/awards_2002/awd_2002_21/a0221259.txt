              ABSTRACT

OCE-0221259

Oxygen transport into sediments in natural marine
              environments is mediated by the turbulent transport scales of motion of the
              bulk overlying solution, molecular diffusion being orders of magnitude slower
              and a virtually insignificant term. The oxygen consumption by sediments,
              conventionally quantified by either laboratory measurements on recovered cores
              or by the artifice of an in-situ enclosure experiment, is a key parameter in
              assessing organic matter decomposition rates and also controls the oxidation of
              sediment reductants such as NH4+, Mn2+, Fe2+, HS-, FeS etc produced during
              anaerobic respiration. Ventilation and irrigation of sedimentary layers either
              by wave induced pumping or bioturbation activity are also processes that could
              potentially be quantified by more reliable measurements of sediment O2
              uptake.
This proposal will extend and explore a recently suggested approach
              being jointly developed by the PI together with colleagues at the Max Planck
              Institute for Marine Microbiology (Bremen). The technique involves correlating
              the time varying concentration of dissolved oxygen, measured by fast response
              microelectrodes, in the sediment boundary layer within a few cm of that surface
              with locally sensed vertical velocity components also sampled at high frequency
              by  acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV). An eddy correlation approach has direct
              analogues with similar techniques that are used by atmospheric scientists
              measuring scalar (e.g. heat, moisture (momentum) and trace gas) fluxes in the
              planetary boundary layer. Theoretical and practical considerations for the
              adaptation of the basic approach into aquatic systems are discussed and will be
              explored at shallow coastal field sites in Denmark (Aarhus Bay).
