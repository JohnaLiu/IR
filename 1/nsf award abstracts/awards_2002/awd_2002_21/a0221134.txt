Abstract    :
              	This dissertation investigates the growth of foreign direct investment in the
              post-socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  Foreign direct
              investment is conceptualized as a social relation between two parties and thus
              subject to the cultural understandings, power struggles, institutional support,
              and social ties that govern all social relations.  Statistical analyses of
              longitudinal, cross-national data will test economic and institutional effects
              on foreign investments in eleven post-socialist countries.  These will be
              supplemented by more qualitative interviews with state officials and investment
              experts.  Analyses of investor-host country dyads will test how institutional,
              political, and cultural relations determine levels of investment for the pair. 
              Finally, firm level success in attracting foreign investment will be
              investigated using contrasting successful and unsuccessful cases from Slovenia.
