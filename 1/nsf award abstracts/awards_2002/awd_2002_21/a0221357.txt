Abstract    :
              Recent technological advances have led to the emergence of sensor networks that
              integrate small, low-power sensors and actuators with limited on-board
              processing and wireless communication capabilities.An example of this type of
              sensor networks is homeland security at airports, bridges, and public
              buildings: a large number of low cost lightweight wireless devices is scattered
              in a geographic region and form a surveillance and communication network.Its
              major function is to locate and track unusual sounds in the region.These
              wireless devices are equipped with acoustic sensors and can locate a sound
              wave.They have to organize themselves dynamically, and
convey the location
              information within a time frame that allows the controller to take necessary
              action, even in the case of poor spatial distribution of sensor devices,
              wireless/acoustic interference, and malicious destruction. Out-of-date
              information is of no use, as the object that was tracked may no longer be in
              the vicinity when the information is received.This presents a key technical
              challenge in cooperative engagement  how to effectively coordinate and control
              sensors over an unreliable wireless ad hoc network  and is the focus of this
              proposal.
Specifically, the researchers propose an integrated framework in
              which a comprehensive solution can be designed with a set of component
              solutions to achieve the targeted goals.Then the resesarchers propose to carry
              out tasks along the following five research avenues:
A unified framework for
              designing, and reasoning the effectiveness of, sensor networks: the researchers
              survey several application scenarios of data-centric, application-oriented
              sensor networks, define an abstract problem for information dissemination in
              sensor networks, and identify a set of requirements and objectives. Then, the
              researchers configure the required functionalities into modules in/across
              layers, and figure in their functional dependency.Under this unified framework,
              one can design protocols specific to a layer without negligence of their
              interaction, and compatibility, with protocols in other layers.Also, cross
              layer issues can be identified and appropriately addressed.
Hierarchical
              cluster formation and routing: Due to the unique characteristics of
              data-centric sensor networks, the researchers  believe topology in the form of
              hierarchical cluster structure offer the greatest performance benefits.Also, as
              the information collected by various sensors may be correlated, redundant,
              and/or of different qualities, this structure facilitates digests of sensor
              data. The researchers propose to develop, and rigorously prove its optimality
              of, a decentralized cluster formation scheme that captures and utilizes these
              unique characteristics. The researchers  will also exercise motion control of
              mobile routers/base stations to effectively recover network partition and/or to
              relieve communication bottlenecks.
Topology control and power management:  The
              researchers consider, in conjunction with the hierarchical cluster formation
              scheme, how to exercise power management so as to maintain network
              connectivity, optimize spatial network reuse, and mitigate MAC-level
              interference.This is achieved by (i) powering off sensors that are not relay
              nodes when there are no events; and (ii) devising strategies for setting (a set
              of) minimal transmission powers when sensors are not evenly distributed.Again
              tasks in this avenue will be carried out with a rigorous theoretical base.
MAC
              design for timely dissemination of delay-sensitive data: The researchers
              address several medium access issues: (i) how to mitigate medium contention to
              improve short-term and long-term throughput fairness, (ii) how to incorporate
              well-grounded scheduling policies in MAC to achieve temporal QoS within/between
              clusters, and (iii) how to tradeoff throughput for delay when real-time
              messages are involved.
Empirical study with the use of Motes: To validate the
              design and to empirically study the overall performance, the researchers will
              leverage the tiny wireless sensors, Motes, and construct a sensor network
              testbed. As Motes are rather limited in their processing and communication
              capability, the researchers will integrate Motes with MOPS/520 PC104
              boards.This is realized by attaching a Mote to the PC board and use the Mote's
              serial peripheral interface (originally for synchronous data transfer between
              the Atmega 163 processor in Motes and peripheral devices) for data transfer
              between the two boards.The researchers  will also simulate acoustic sensor
              behaviors by using the sound cards and microphone on the PC104 board.With such
              a sensor network testbed in place, the researchers will be able to implement
              and experiment with the proposed protocols and algorithms. The researchers 
              plan to simulate homeland surveillance where acoustic sensors can give clues to
              guards who watch close circuit TVs.
