Abstract    :
              This grant enables the installation and operation of equipment at Duke
              University for measuring the ULF (ultra low frequency) magnetic field
              associated with certain lightning discharges.  A strong and long-lasting
              current sometimes flows after lightning strokes in the conducting channel they
              leave behind.  Called the continuing current, it is not well understood but is
              a detail of the physics of lightning that is thought to be related to cloud
              electrification and to phenomena in the high atmosphere such as sprites and
              elves.   Continuing currents produce signals in the ULF magnetic field that can
              be detected as far as 2000 km from the lightning source.  Methods will be
              developed on this project to detect continuing currents remotely and infer
              their duration and waveform from ULF measurements.  The data interpretation
              will be validated by comparing measured waveforms of the continuing currents
              associated with triggered lightning at a field station in Camp Blanding,
              Florida, with the waveforms inferred from ULF measurements.  A goal is to
              continuously record the magnetic fields from lightning discharges detectable at
              the Duke ULF station and relate the measurements to storm structure and
              meteorological conditions.  If the continuing current turns out to be related
              to storm severity or stage of evolution, it may be a useful tool for the study
              and forecasting of storms.
