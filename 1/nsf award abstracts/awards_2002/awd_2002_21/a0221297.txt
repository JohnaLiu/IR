Abstract    :
              'Female choice' is a form of sexual selection well documented at the level of
              precopulatory choice and helps to explain many male traits (e.g. peacock
              feathers).  After or during copulation, however, females may differentially
              influence the fate of ejaculate from two or more males to affect paternity
              outcomes.  This phenomenon, referred to as 'cryptic female choice' (CFC), is
              currently under intense investigation because 1) it adds a new dimension to the
              evolutionary conflict between the sexes, and 2) it changes our views on the
              degree to which females influence male reproductive success. 
        This
              study examines the relationship between two species of tephritid flies with
              divergent mating systems and the potential for female influence on sperm use
              and storage. One species mates infrequently and has a complex courtship
              behavior, whereas the other species mates frequently and has minimal courtship
              behavior.  CFC is predicted to be more important in species that exhibit
              multiple matings with little pre-copulatory choice. This study uses a
              multi-pronged approach to estimate the presence and degree of female influence
              on reproductive outcomes by examining sperm storage, mating behavior,
              neuromuscular control, and paternity outcomes in relation to male
              characters.
