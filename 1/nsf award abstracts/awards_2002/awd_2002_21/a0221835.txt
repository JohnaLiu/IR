Abstract    :
              The project will involve an interdisciplinary study at the Arctic Long-Term
              Ecological Research site that will use existing, state-of-the-art models of
              hydrology and biogeochemistry, and improve them with field studies of critical
              processes of plant production, microbial decomposition, and production rates of
              dissolved substances in soil water. The models will be eventually linked to
              determine how soil moisture, spatial connectivity, and the timing of
              meteorological drivers impact carbon-nitrogen cycling and catchment export. Dr.
              Stieglitz, and co-PIs, Drs. Griffin (Columbia), Hobbie (Marine Biological
              Laboratory, Woods Hole), Kling (Michigan), and Schimel (UCSB), will analyze C-N
              cycling at the catchment scale to answer questions related to element coupling,
              impact of strength and synchronicity of external forcing, and impacts of
              spatial heterogeneity of vegetation and hydrological connectivity. The PIs
              expect this research to advance understanding of land-use changes and
              eutrophication of coastlines, climate change and altered ecosystem function,
              and global processes such as sea-ice and deep water formation in the Arctic
              ocean.
