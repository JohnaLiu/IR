Abstract    :
              Award is for a project to analyze multichannel seismic data acquired in the
              offshore Cantebury Basin, on the eastern margin of the South Island of New
              Zealand.  Interpretation and mapping of the high resolution multichannel
              seismic profiles and integration with existing commercial and deep-penetration
              academic multichannel seismic profiles will allow evaluation of the relative
              roles of eustacy, tectonics, sediment supply and currents on stratigraphic
              development.  The Cantebury Basin comprises a southern hemisphere counterpart
              to the New Jersey margin: both representing siliciclastic margins.  The
              analysis will define the 3-D sequence geometries to reveal spatial and temporal
              changes in sequence geometry, and evaluate the relative importance of local
              versus global controls by using forward stratigraphic modeling to reproduce
              observed geometries.
