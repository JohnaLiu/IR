Abstract    :
              Biology has become an information science, fueled by high throughput genomic
              sequencing and functional genomics analyses.  However, although many biological
              data resources are available, there is little ability to interoperate and
              existing software and tools are reinvented.  A set of data models and
              supporting software libraries will be developed that support database
              interoperation.  This effort will occur in collaboration with other systems in
              development.  Resources developed under the NSF Plan Genome Research Program
              will be the resource targets.  The approach is to define XML-based descriptions
              for types of object that are likely targets for inter-database queries. The
              effort will be in the context of a series of workshop that will enable the
              community to identify the target data objects and to cooperate in the
              implementation of software.  The project will provide electronic resources for
              a wide variety of data that will enhance both research and education and
              training.
