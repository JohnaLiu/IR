Abstract    :
              0221836  Aitken  A stable isotope method will be used to prepare heavy DNA from
              incubations of mixed cultures and specific C-13 labelled PAH substrates in
              completely closed slurry aerobic bioreactors.  The bioreactor is fitted with a
              gas chromatograph  which allows on- line respirometric measurements.  DNA and
              rRNA will be extracted from the slurry,  amplified by PCR, and analyzed on
              agarose gels.  Comparisons between the DGGE profiles obtainedfrom rDNA (PCR),
              rRNA (RT-PCR) and C-13 labelled rDNA and rRNA will provide insight  into the
              metabolically active members of the community.  Selected DGGE bands will be
              sequenced and submitted for phylogenetic analysis using PHYLIP software.
