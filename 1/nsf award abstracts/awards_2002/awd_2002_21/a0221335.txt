Abstract    :
              0221335 Duncan
It has been observed that the rate of gas transfer across the
              air-sea interface correlates well with the mean squared slope of the high
              frequency surface waves.  It has also been noted that the presence of
              surfactants, at concentrations that have almost no effect on surface tension,
              dramatically reduces the high frequency components of the wind wave spectrum. 
              Wave tank studies of wind waves, and wind waves plus mechanically generated
              waves, with and without soluble surfactants, will seek to understand the
              mechanisms for this reduction in mean squared slope in the presence of
              surfactants, as well as the characteristics of high frequency waves.  At low
              concentrations, it is hypothesized that the effects may result from the
              concentrating of surfactants at the wave crests, where capillary effects are
              typically largest.  A variety of laboratory measurement techniques will be
              used.  A cart carries measurement devices along the wave tank at speeds
              commensurate with the wave phase.  Second Harmonic Generation techniques allow
              dynamic measurement of surfactant concentration.  For these latter studies, the
              system will be at a fixed location and randomly sample the wind waves.
