Abstract    :
              	This dissertation investigates the ability of a state to manipulate national
              identity by investigating the history of the former German city of Koenigsberg
              after it was taken over by the Soviet Union in 1945 and renamed Kaliningrad. 
              In the following decades, the pre-war history of the city became the focus of a
              struggle between the Soviet state, the local administration, and the Russian
              speaking citizens.  Despite Soviet prohibitions, the local population
              maintained the German history of the territory.  Interviews and archival data
              will be used to document the state-promoted official history and the efforts by
              the local intelligentsia to reproduce the German history of the territory. 
              Architectural projects (deconstruction, reconstruction, and preservation)
              provide an especially valuable historical record for understanding how these
              conflicts over collective memory varied over time with changes in the political
              regime.
