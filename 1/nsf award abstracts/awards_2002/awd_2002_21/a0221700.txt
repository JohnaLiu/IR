Abstract    :
              This is a three year project to continue the investigations of emissions in the
              terrestrial atmosphere using data obtained with the 10-m W. H. Keck telescope
              on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Much of the data to be used have already been collected
              and have been used in a co-added form to provide dramatic advances in the
              spectroscopy of the MLT region. However, some aspects of these data have not
              yet been tapped, and much new information is potentially available from 50-min
              data sets on oxygen, nitrogen and sodium emissions.
 
The Physical Sciences
              Division at SRI International makes a substantial contribution to developing
              human resources over a range of educational levels, from undergraduate to
              postdoctoral training. The Molecular Physics Laboratory has been particularly
              active in the NSF REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) Program.
