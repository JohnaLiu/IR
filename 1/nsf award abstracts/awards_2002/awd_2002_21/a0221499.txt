Abstract    :
              	This dissertation investigates the meaning of consumption for parents seeking
              the "good care" of their children.  The research focuses on the emotional
              processes by which these consumers decide just what is good care and what kinds
              of "things" are part of that care.  Textual analysis of toy catalogs will be
              combined with ethnographic fieldwork on shopping trips and interviews with
              parents about consumption and raising children.  These multiple methods
              (conversations about buying, observations of spending, and considerations of
              selling) seek to explain how people make sense of the convergence of
              consumption, class, and care in our contemporary culture.
