Abstract    :
              Under this award, the PIs will measure the seismic velocities, modal mineralogy,
              water content, and mineral and rock elastic properties in order to understand
              what controls the seismic velocity variation with depth in the lower ocean
              crust. Whereas conventional wisdom suggests that the observed velocity changes
              with depth in lower ocean crust (seismic layer 3) and the observed velocity
              gradients are controlled by increasing pressure and decreasing alteration
              (chlorite) with depth, recent evidence by the PIs indicates these factors are
              unlikely to exert  major control. Instead, preliminary data suggest that the
              presence of hydrous minerals and the overall water content of the rocks may
              control the seismic velocities. The additional measurements for samples from
              ODP holes 504B, 735B, 894G, and 923A will be used to test this hypothesis and
              extend the findings to answer several specific questions about the
              relationships between mineralogy, cracks, water content, and hydrous phases, on
              the seismic velocities and velocity gradients in the lower ocean crust.
