Investigation of the
              chemical structures of the uncharacterized fraction of marine dissolved organic
              matter remains an elusive goal for marine organic chemists. An approach to be
              used in this work  is to directly address supramolecular size scales of marine
              organic matter structures by assessing their microheterogeneity on micro to
              nanoscales. Using Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM), a technique
              that allows the registration of Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure
              (NEXAFS) spectra, will allow the quantification of the relative abundance of
              different functional groups and element bonding types. This spatial mapping of
              the chemistry of macromolecular assemblages at scales intermediate between bulk
              chemical analysis and analysis individual molecules or molecular classes offers
              the capabilities of a important new analytical tool to marine chemistry. 
In a
              survey mode, a range of  organic materials collected and contributed by several
              researchers from different parts of the world's oceans will be examined using
              these techniques. This approach will be extended with additional samples of
              collected sediment and suspended (trapped) particulates. Laboratory experiments
              using whole phytoplankton and bacterial cultures will be used to provide
              materials appropriate to the earlier stages of organic matter  diagenesis.
