Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to construct a series of process models to examine
              the transport of heat and moisture from low to high latitudes in the atmosphere
              and oceans and their interactions with ice sheets.  The central thesis of the
              research is that the Earth's obliquity controls the differential of insolation
              between high and low latitudes and, hence, ice volume and climate.  
              

Milankovitch theory postulates that ice-age cycles are controlled by
              insolation in high northern latitudes in summer. This insolation is dominated
              by the 23,000-year period of the precession cycle.  Paleoclimate evidence,
              however, indicates that the dominant period in ice volume over the last three
              million years is the 41,000-year period of obliquity. This discrepancy
              represents a crucial gap in understanding in the science of
              paleoclimatology.

Validating the insolation gradient hypothesis would
              greatly advance our understanding of Earth's past climate history. Since no
              climate model has yet succeeded in reproducing the record of the ice ages, the
              knowledge gained in validating the hypothesis would also point the way towards
              constructing climate models with greater reliability for predicting future
              climate changes. 

Funding is primarily for the support of a graduate student
              who would carry out the proposed research as part of a doctoral research
              project.
