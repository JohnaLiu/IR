The proposed work will create a 3D finite element (FE) mesh
              of the human femur in which each element possesses unique material properties
              and principal material directions.  The effort will introduce modal analysis
              into an algorithm to model bone adaptation.  The mesh will be deployed to
              conduct near real-time FE analyses, using a new FE code written by the PI and
              optimized and parallelized for a massive parallel computer whose output can be
              viewed in 3D virtual reality mode at a high performance visualization facility.
               The ultimate goal is to bring the power of high performance computing into the
              surgical ward, thus enabling the surgeon to visualize the stress shielding
              consequences of a particular fixation method.
