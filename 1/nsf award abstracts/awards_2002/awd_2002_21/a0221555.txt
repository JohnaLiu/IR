Abstract    :
              The Glenn H. Brown Prizes were established in 1986 to advance and diffuse
              knowledge of liquid crystal states of matter by encouraging effective written
              and oral presentations of doctoral research results. At the International
              Liquid Crystal Conference to be held June 30-July 5, 2002 in Edinburgh,
              Scotland, the International Liquid Crystal Society will award prizes for
              outstanding thesis completed between January 2000 and December 2001. Tesis on
              theoretical, experimental and/or applied work on thermotropic, polymeric and/or
              lyotropic liquid crystal systems will be considered. 

The liquid crystal
              community continues to have direct impact on education and the development of
              new materials for technological advances of high significance to society. The
              latter include the development of novel electro optic devices of high
              commercial interest. Since these technical areas are of very high priority to
              industry, students educated and trained in these multidisciplinary areas
              involving liquid crystal science and engineering compete very well in the job
              market and go on  to contribute in many significant ways to the global
              economy.
