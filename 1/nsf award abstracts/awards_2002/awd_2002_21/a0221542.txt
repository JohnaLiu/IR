Abstract    :
              Recently, it has been shown that one major source of errors in numerical weather
              predictions is generated by using comparatively deterministic functions of
              resolvable variables to represent the unresolved sub-grid processes. One effort
              in improving ensemble predictions involves perturbing the physical
              parameterizations of the model. To tackle the problem, the PI will study the
              sub-grid scale signatures in various verification measures and use a
              combination of them to improve the ensemble forecasts. An idealized model with
              low-dimension configurations will be used for the study. The research focus
              will be on the interactions of the resolvable variables and unresolved
              processes with particular attention on the effects of different perturbation
              amplitudes, correlation scales for the random element of physical
              parameterizations, and possible signatures of these errors in appropriate
              diagnostics. The overall goal of the research is to provide knowledge on the
              structure of perturbations in physical parameterizations and to represent them
              properly in ensemble forecasts.  

The research study has the potential of
              generating useful information for operational weather prediction.
