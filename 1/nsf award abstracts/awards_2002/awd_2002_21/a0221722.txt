Abstract    :
              This project will examine the framework for supporting cybersecurity research. 
              It will consider where and how important topics are covered (building on past
              work, which has identified many important and often enduring topics), the
              distribution of research effort among actors (with emphasis on universities, in
              part to address the link between the conduct of researchers and the education
              and training of cyber security experts to ensure that there are enough
              researchers to perform the needed work), and the distribution and range of
              support programs among federal funding organizations.  The project will examine
              issues regarding and options for improving coordination and efficacy in the
              national pursuit of cybersecurity research.  A brief report with
              recommendations will be developed.
