Abstract    :
              	This dissertation investigates the consequences of state decentralization on
              the expansion of civil society in two Venezuelan municipalities.  Past theory
              has made contradictory predictions about these effects: on the one hand, the
              expansion of municipal government functions should stimulate the growth of
              local civic institutions as political decisions are being made closer to
              people's own experience.  On the other hand, decentralization may just promote
              rent seeking by local elites that would inhibit associational life.  The
              research will compare two municipalities with different histories of civic
              development.  Directories and official data will be searched to estimate the
              growth of civic associations.  Interviews with local leaders will ascertain how
              the activities and structure of these organizations have changed since the
              adoption of state decentralization
