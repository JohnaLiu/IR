The proposed project leverages recent advances in nanoparticle
              technologies to develop innovative contrast agents which can be optically
              interrogated using noninvasive approaches and targeted to specific molecular
              signatures of disease. The contrast agents proposed - nanoshells and
              nanoemitters - possess ideal optical and chemical properties for optical
              imaging. The optical response of these particles can be precisely and
              systematically varied over a broad band including the visible and infrared
              spectral regions. The extremely agile. tunabilityof the optical resonance is
              completely unique to nanoshells: in no other molecular or nanoparticle
              structure can the resonance of the optical extinction properties be
              systematically. designed. Moreover, the nanoparticles are highly biocompatible
              and proteins (such as antibodies) are readily conjugated to their surfaces. To
              develop the potential of nanoparticles as contrast agents for optical imaging,
              the investigators will study a novel class of exogenous contrast agents
              designed and optimized to address the clinically important problem of detection
              of pre.invasive neoplasias.
