Abstract    :
              Biological museums and herbaria are estimated to contain three billion animal
              and plant specimens that document the temporal and spatial distribution of life
              on earth. Four hundred years of biological survey, species description and
              archiving in museums and herbaria have produced a massive, globally distributed
              knowledge resource documenting the planet's biological diversity.  The Specify
              Software Project supports the computerization of biological collections data. 
              Support and development of Specify, a biological collections database
              application, is provided free of charge at http://www.usobi.org/specify. 
              Specify is currently used by 55 collections.  

In this project, Specify's
              core data management will be enhanced and the usability of the interface will
              be improved and extended so that users can customize the web components
              considered.  Further, there will be full integration with the Species Analyst
              Network.  A help desk and technical support are provided to collections. 
              Overall, the Specify Project will enable the capture and integration of
              millions of specimen records into computing architectures that will enable
              cross-domain research and education in environmental science.
