Abstract    :
              This project is the initial development of an in-site sensor package designed to
              quantify spatial and temporal variations of environmental parameters within
              submarine hydrothermal systems.  A prototype sensor will be developed that
              includes a titanium-sheathed, porous, multi-chambered prove that will allow
              in-site recording of temperature within the interior of active submarine
              hydrothermal sulfide chimneys.  The ultimate goal is to explore the actual
              limits to life in vent systems and to define the conditions under which
              different species or consortia thrive, survive, or expire.
