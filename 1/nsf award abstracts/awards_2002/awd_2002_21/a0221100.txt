One of the major most profound changes to occur in
              Europe or Asia in the past century was the fall of communism and the subsequent
              transition to capitalism of the former Soviet countries.  This Doctoral
              Dissertation Improvement Grant examines organizational adaptation and change in
              business practices resulting from the changing role of the Russian state in its
              economy.  The project focuses on small individual enterprises, and in
              particular on relationships between Russian small firms and their trading
              partners and the Russian state.  In western countries the legal system and
              public authorities guarantee property rights and contracts, but in Russian
              state enforcement institutions are unable to provide these same protections. 
              The goal of the study is to specify how the inadequacies of state enforcement
              affects business practices among small and medium sized privately owned
              business firms in contemporary Russia, what kind of informal enforcement
              strategies develop, and to trace the roots of these strategies and the
              implications they may have for the building of capitalism in Russia.  The
              dissertation candidate will interview owners and managers of 72 small and
              medium-sized firms in St. Petersburg, Russia.  Structured interviews will be
              used to gather information on views and practices.  This data will be
              integrated with similar interviews conducted with owner and managers of 18
              small private firms in St. Petersburg as part of a pilot study.
