Abstract    :
              This project will test the utility of extraterrestrial 3He as a constant flux
              proxy for paleoceanographic research over long time scales (last 1.5  Ma).   
              The study  will determine 3He accumulation rates at three sites,  ODP 806,
              TT013-PC72, and ODP 849,  representing a transect in the equatorial Pacific. 
              Absolute 3He rates will be evaluated by using 18O dating of sediments over the
              last 1.5 Ma.  Relative changes in 3He accumulation rates will be evaluated by
              normalizing concentrations of 3He to those of 10Be (decay corrected).  In
              addition the project will measure 230Th at each site over the last 300,000
              years to test the sensitivity of 3He and 10Be accumulation rates to climate
              variability.
