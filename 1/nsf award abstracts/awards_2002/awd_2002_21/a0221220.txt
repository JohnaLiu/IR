Abstract    :
              	This dissertation investigates the causes and earnings outcomes of employment
              in ethnic niches among the Latino population in Boston and Los Angeles.  Data
              from the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality will be used because this survey
              identifies the ethnic backgrounds of the respondents' coworkers and supervisor.
               In addition to the usual human capital variables as determinants of employment
              and earnings (e.g., education, English fluency), the study will focus on
              nativity, skin color, national origin, and gender.  The research will also
              investigate the role of job search strategies that use informal networks of
              family and friends as an explanation for how Latinos and especially Latinas end
              up employed in ethnic niches.
