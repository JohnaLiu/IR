This work addresses the
              fundamental question of how dissipation is accomplished for the large-scale
              circulation while in equilibrium. The hypothesis to be addressed is that a
              crucial step en route to dissipation is that instabilities of mesoscale
              structures arise due to unbalanced motions. Computation models based on
              different dynamical approximations will be used to help distinguish and
              determine the different mechanisms of forward energy cascades.  Several
              different mesoscale circulation regimes will be examined to determine where
              energy transfer exchange with the sub-mesoscale unbalanced motions is likely to
              occur; these regimes will include the following: an inflowing jet, boundary
              upwelling, and homogeneous turbulence.  The standard for dynamical behavior
              will be the non-hydrostatic Boussinesq equations.  New methods will be devised
              to partition the flow and its dissipation routes into balanced and unbalanced
              parts in order to say when the interior dissipation is likely to be enhanced
              over the expectation of geostrophic turbulence.  The broader goal will be to
              determine how the vertical and horizontal eddy viscosities in GCMs should
              depend upon the large- and mesoscale properties of the resolved circulation and
              stratification.
