Abstract    :
              Award is for a seismic stratigraphic mapping and piston coring project to
              determine the age, configuration and paleoceanographic significance of the
              sedimentary sequences on J Anomaly Ridge and Southeast Newfoundland Ridge. 
              These ridges are ideally located to record any evidence for strong boundary
              currents dating to the early Paleogene.  Existing data show that the ridge
              system is draped by sedimentary sequences that record development of the
              boundary current during the Oligocene and Neogene, and suggest that deposition
              of  Paleocene-Eocene sequences may have also been influenced by currents. If
              strong Deep Western Boundary Current or related northward flow occurred in the
              North Atlantic prior to the onset of extensive Antarctic glaciation in the
              early Oligocene, it likely affected deposition of sediment on the J Anomaly
              Ridge and Southeast Newfoundland Ridge.  The seismic stratigraphic mapping and
              piston coring will test the hypothesis that the sediment sequences deposited on
              these ridges record strong overturning circulation in the North Atlantic prior
              to the onset of Antarctic glaciation.
