Abstract    :
              0221880  Silverstein  The effects of acid mine drainage on natural
              biogeochemical nitrogen cycling will be studied with respect to the interaction
              of microbial nitrogen and iron transformations at the lowered pH found in
              receiving waters.  Competition between ferric iron and nitrate as electron
              acceptors, use of ferrous iron as electron donor in denitrification, and
              mobilization of iron and other heavy metals from bacterial reduction will be
              investigated in acid main drainage impacted streams.  Species identification in
              impacted and unimpacted streams will be made utilizing DNA probes and the FISH
              technique and microscopic counts will be used to produce quantitative estimates
              of chemolithotrophic iron oxidizers and heterotrophic acidophiles.
