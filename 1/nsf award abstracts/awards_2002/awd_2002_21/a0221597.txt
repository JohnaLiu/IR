This award provides support to continue Design Projects'
              activities begun under NSF award #9631744 at Arizona State University (ASC) in
              which students designed and built custom projects for people with disabilities.
              The objectives of the activities are to enhance engineering education, provide
              students with insight into careers in biomedical engineering, improve the
              quality of life of people with disabilities, and serve the community. The past
              12 years of design projects activity at ASU led to the successful completion of
              109 design projects and training of 115 undergraduate students in basic design
              principles. 

The design projects' activity is structured to work
              successfully within the environment of ASU. Disability Resources for Students
              (DRS), which provides accommodations for hundreds of mentally and physically
              disabled students on the ASU campus, will be closely integrated with the
              student engineers' work. Ten senior design projects are to be pursued each year
              in conjunction with DRS to develop the prototype devices. Two undergraduate
              summer interns are to be supported under the program to work part-time at DRS
              to develop a listing of appropriate projects for the student engineers. A
              graduate student is to assist in administering the program by helping the
              undergraduate design teams and fostering new connections between ASU and nearby
              communities to serve and/or support persons with disabilities. This project is
              to introduce 10 to 20 new engineers each year to the daily problems faced by
              the disabled. Additionally, the disabled community will be directly involved as
              design consultants and thereby increase the participation of an
              underrepresented group in the activity.
