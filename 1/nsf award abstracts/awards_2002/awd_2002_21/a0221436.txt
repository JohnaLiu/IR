Abstract    :
              This award is for an add-on to a funded field program to investigate the
              incipient rift located on the east side of the East Pacific Rise at 2 degrees
              40'N by E. Klein and D. Smith (0099154).  This incipient rift is volcanically
              active and may provide the unique opportunity of sampling the melting regime
              under the EPR with increasing distance from the axis.  This add-on would carry
              out theoretical modeling of the upwelling and melting reime in order to improve
              understanding of the melt production and migration bvelow the EPR.  The PI will
              work with M. Spiegelman to modify existing 2D mantle flow and melt models to
              include the incipient rift.  After that, 3D models will be developed and tested
              against geochemical data.
