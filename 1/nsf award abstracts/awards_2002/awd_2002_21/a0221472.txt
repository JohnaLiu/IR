              ABSTRACT

OCE-0221472

The importance of tropospheric halocarbons as a
              source for stratospheric halogens  and ozone depletion is well recognized.
              Industrial production of longer-lived CFC's have  been banned under the
              Montreal Protocol and Clean Air Act, however the time scale for  recovery of
              the ozone layer from such molecules is on the order of decades. As a result, 
              attention has shifted towards the shorter-lived halocarbons that respond more
              rapidly to  changes in emissions. 

In this project, researchers at the
              University of California at Irvine will continue their ongoing efforts to
              understand the role of the oceans in the  biogeochemical cycling of low
              molecular-weight halocarbons, like methyl bromide  (CH3Br) and methyl chloride
              (CH3Cl). In this phase of their research, oceanic degradation studies will be
              continued in order to extend prior spatial and temporal coverage of the oceans,
              and to include methyl  chloride (CH3Cl).  The degradation of other natural
              halogenated compounds such as  dibromomethane (CH2Br2), bromoform (CHBr3), and
              methyl iodide (CH3I) will also be  studied in coastal seawater. The proposed
              measurements will result in revised estimates  for the uptake of atmospheric
              halocarbons by the oceans, the extent to which the oceans  can buffer
              atmospheric halocarbon concentrations, and the production rate for these gases 
              in the surface oceans.
