Abstract    :
              	This dissertation compares professionalization and unionization as means for
              promoting the interests of family child-care workers.  Initially, qualitative
              methods will investigate two Illinois campaigns representing each strategy. 
              The professionalization and unionization campaigns differ in their reliance on
              child development experts or grassroots organizers; in their advocacy of better
              training and certification or their emphasis on worker solidarity; and in their
              state lobbying efforts for higher child care standards or increased pay for
              workers.   Surveys will evaluate the success of each type of campaign in
              mobilizing support among child care workers.  The study expects the
              unionization campaign to be more attractive to lower income child care workers
              while the professionalization campaign should be better supported by the child
              care workers who are already better educated.
