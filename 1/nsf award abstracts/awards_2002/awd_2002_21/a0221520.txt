This Pan America Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) award on
              Quantum Information, jointly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF)
              and the Department of Energy (DOE), is being organized by Dr. Atac Imamoglu of
              the University of California-Santa Barbara in collaboration with Dr. L.
              Davidovich of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. The
              meeting, which will be held January 12 -23, 2003 in both Buzios and Salvador,
              Brazil, will bring together leading researchers, advanced graduate students,
              post-doctoral and junior scientists in the field of quantum information.
              

Over the past few years, the field of quantum information has evolved to
              become truly interdisciplinary with contributions from computer science,
              quantum optics, and condensed matter physics. This interdisciplinary PASI will
              serve to increase and disseminate understanding of the fundamental issues in
              the field, and will lead to enhanced collaboration between researchers in the
              United States and in the rest of the hemisphere.
