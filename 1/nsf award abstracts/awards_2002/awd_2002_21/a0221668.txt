Abstract    :
              Though this TCUP planning award Little Big Horn College, located on the Crow
              Reservation, will develop a comprehensive long-term plan for strengthening the
              institution's Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) programs.
              The project will be divided into four phases: assessment of the current status
              of STEM curricula, infrastructure and student support; implementation of a
              2-day planning retreat; development of the detailed long-range STEM plan; and
              preparation/submission of a TCUP implementation award proposal.

The
              institution feels that the planning process and the development of a long-term
              STEM plan will provide it with the potential to make significant and
              sustainable improvements in the STEM programs including better integration and
              leveraging of information technology.
