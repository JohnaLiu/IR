This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI) award on
              physics at the nanometer scale, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department
              of Energy (DOE), will engage graduate and post-doctoral students from the
              hemisphere in an intensive course of 10 days duration in an area of
              nanotechnology of much current interest.  Organized by Dr. Fernando Ponce of
              the Arizona State University and Dr. Carlos Balseiro of the Centro Atomico de
              Bariloche, Argentina, the PASI will be held at the Centro Atomico de Bariloche,
              June 1-12, 2003 and will feature tutorials and lectures on nanomagnetism,
              nanowires and nanotubes, nanoparticles, nanoelectronics and transport through
              nanodevices, nano-optoelectronics, nano-fabrication and nano-characterization,
              and bio-nanotechnology.  In addition, the PASI will include poster sessions for
              the presentation of research studies and results by junior and other
              participants, in order to foster content-specific interactions. This intensive
              exchange should promote future collaborative research with the next generation
              of scientists. Expected outcomes are a book, videotapes of the proceedings, and
              a web site with at least summaries of the lectures.
