Turning to Digital Government in a
              Crisis:  Coordinating Government Business & Non-Profit Services in Response to
              the World Trade Center Attacks of September 11, 2001

This Small Grant for
              Exploratory Research will examine what government agencies did in the midst of
              and immediately after the attacks on the World Trace Center, and the role of
              information technologies in the events.  Starting at Pier 92, where New York
              City's Emergency Operation Center was re-established, this work will document
              the network of relationships, information flow, and actions through interfiews
              with key participants.  Research topics and policy questions will be
              identified.
