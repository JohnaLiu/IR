Abstract    :
              This project will improve understanding of terrestrial carbon sinks by linking
              process-level biological information obtained for individual plants or
              ecosystems over short time scales with observations and models that
              characterize the large spatial domain and long time scales of regional and
              global concern.  The P.I. will obtain comprehensive observations and use
              archived data integrated across several spatial and temporal scales, including
              tower and aircraft flux measurements and forest biomass inventories, to develop
              an integrated ecosystem-atmosphere model that captures both slow and fast
              ecosystem processes.  The combined results will provide quantitative
              constraints to the carbon budget at regional scales.  The integrated model will
              be optimized using atmospheric and biospheric data that quantitatively link
              properties of the terrestrial biosphere-atmosphere system with the underlying
              fundamental biological and physical processes.  The project has an outreach
              program that includes an interactive CD-ROM with information on the carbon
              cycle and climate change and a module for having students conduct hypothesis
              testing using project data.
