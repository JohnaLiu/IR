Abstract    :
              	This dissertation investigates the organizational factors that affect a union's
              efforts to organize nonunion workplaces.  Fifteen locals will be randomly
              selected for study from each of the largest 20 international unions.  Annual
              measures of resources used for organizing will be taken from financial
              disclosure forms unions filed with the Department of Labor.  These include
              estimates of the total expenditures on organizing and the size of the staff
              devoted to organizing.  These same disclosure forms also include data that will
              be used to measure the degree of oligarchic leadership structure that may
              depress organizing and rank-and-file mobilization.  These include the
              expenditures on officer salaries, the tenure length of officers, and the extent
              of union investments.  Other measures in the analysis include union size, the
              proportion of union income from member dues, and whether union officers are
              elected by the rank-and-file.  The outcomes to be studied are the number and
              success of union organizing efforts between 1991 and 2001, a period of growing
              union organizing efforts.  Event history analysis will evaluate which of the
              union organizational variables are associated with union organizing efforts and
              union success two years later.
