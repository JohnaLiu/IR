              ABSTRACT

OCE-0221979

Reorganizations of large-scale ocean circulation very
              likely triggered the large and abrupt  climate changes which punctuated the
              glacial world. Hence, as part of our preparation to deal with the ongoing
              greenhouse gas buildup, we must learn as much as possible regarding the  nature
              of the ocean's alternate modes of operation. This project is aimed toward doing
              just this.

Two paleo observations for the glacial deep Atlantic fail to
              jibe. One is the difference  between the 14 C to C ages for coexisting benthic
              and planktonic foraminifera, which was greater  than that for pre-industrial
              time but still far less than that for the deep Pacific. This suggests that  the
              conveyor circulation was operating at a somewhat reduced but still significant
              rate. The other  is the tilt of density horizons across the Florida Straits
              reconstructed from 18O measurements on  benthic foraminifera which suggest that
              the strength of conveyor circulation was far less than  today's.

In the
              absence of a clear way to reconcile these observations with one another and
              also with  the nutrient content reconstructed for glacial age lower deep water,
              researchers at the Lamont Dougherty Eart Observatory of Columbia University
              will attempt to improve upon both  the paleonutrient reconstruction and the
              estimates of benthic-planktonic age difference. To do so, they have  identified
              21 cores in the LDEO collection forming a traverse sampling along the western
              flank of the  Mid Atlantic Ridge extending from 45'N to 45'S (water depth 3.6 +
              0.4 km). They will  establish the stratigraphy in each core by 14C and 18O
              measurements on planktonic foraminifera  and also attempt to quantify the
              extent to which Holocene foraminifera have been mixed  downward into the late
              glacial section by analyzing single benthic foraminifera for 18O.  They will
              then do d18O, d13C, Cd, and Zn measurements on benthic foraminifera, and
              neodymium  isotope measurements on dispersed ferromanganese coatings on fine
              silicate debris, in late  glacial sections for all cores.  Additionally they
              will measure benthic-planktonic 14C age differences on late  glacial samples
              from the cores with the highest sedimentation rate.
