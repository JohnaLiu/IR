Abstract    :
              Under this award, the PI will attempt to constrain the evolution and origin of
              the unusual Indian Ocean mantle domain by determining the initial hafnium
              isotope compositions and Lu and Hf concentrations of old oceanic crustal
              basalts from 21 DSDP/ODP drill sites and two Tethyan ophiolite complexes
              already studied for Sr, Nd and Pb isotopes. Establishing the Hf isotopic
              composition of old Indian Ocean and Tethyan crust will help to determine when
              and where this isotopic signature first appeared in the Indian Ocean mantle
              domain, and if it was present in the composition of Tethyan crust produced
              before the opening of the Indian Ocean basin. It will also help to determine
              whether the distinct composition of the Indian Ocean mantle domain is primarily
              derived from subducted, deeply recycled components that have undergone
              extensive mixing and homogenization in the mantle, or whether it more likely
              derives from shallow contamination via the foundering of local Gondwanan
              continental lithosphere, which has evolved in isolation from the convecting
              mantle for billions of years.
