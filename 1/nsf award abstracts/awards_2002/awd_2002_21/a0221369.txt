 Simple theoretical models of the Antarctic Circumpolar
              Current (ACC) will developed and applied  to further our understanding of this
              central component of the global ocean circulation. The formalism of the
              residual mean will be exploited in an attempt to develop a theory for the
              stratification and overturning circulation of the ACC and how it depends on
              eddy transfer processes and the patterns of wind and air-sea flux acting at its
              surface.  Specifically, solutions of the zonal-average residual mean problem
              will be fully explored to investigate processes that control the pattern of
              meridional overturning and interior stratification of the ACC. Those solutions
              will then be extended to 3-dimensions to explore the role of regional patterns
              of air-sea interaction and topographic interaction on ACC dynamics: this will
              be done by numerical solution of the residual mean equations in 3-dimensions.
              Finally, the theoretical model will diagnosed in terms of more realistic models
              and observations. The intellectual thrust of the proposal is that it addresses
              issues that are fundamental to our understanding of the general circulation of
              the ocean: the role and representation of the ocean's geostrophic eddy field in
              shaping the large-scale circulation of the ACC. It seeks to develop a simple
              conceptual framework that, if successful, could provide a reference point for
              observation and models of circumpolar flow. The study has the potential for
              broad impact because the ACC is a system of great importance to the global
              ocean and to global climate, is thought to be major player in
              glacial-interglacial cycles, uptake of anthropogenic CO2 and global
              biogeochemical cycles.
