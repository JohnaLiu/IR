Abstract    :
              	This dissertation investigates the rise of racial profiling as a political
              issue in the civil rights movement.  The history is seen as an instance of how
              groups use cultural tools in political conflict.  The results will demonstrate
              that politics are profoundly cultural and culture is often profoundly
              political.  The research analyzes the cultural framing process in public
              discourse through a systematic content analysis of newspapers, TV news,
              legislation, legal arguments, and judicial decisions.  Interviews with key
              leaders will help reveal how deliberate cultural strategies were developed to
              mobilize opposition to racial profiling.
