Abstract    :
              Funds are recommended for assessment of average and seasonal sea-surface
              temperature and seawater delta O-18 at annual to decadal scales from monthly
              sub-samples in select intervals of the Holocene on samples from the Dry
              Tortugas. The study also includes a calibration effort for the past century. It
              aims to reconstruct Holocene (selected time-slices over the last 8.2 Ka)
              changes in western Tropical Atlantic SSTs and salinity using Sr/Ca and stable
              isotope analyses of fossil corals. The approach takes advantage of the fact
              that corals record temperature and (salinity) histories over a narrow depth
              range of the tropical ocean, and that fossil corals provide a means to
              reconstruct ocean properties for discrete short (multi-century) time slices
              throughout the Holocene. Coral paleoclimate reconstructions from the tropics
              will improve our understanding of the mechanisms driving the climate changes in
              the Holocene.
