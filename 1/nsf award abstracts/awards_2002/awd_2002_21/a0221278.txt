Abstract    :
              	 This dissertation investigates the effects of non-governmental organizations
              (NGOs) on economic development.  Among the studies planned are a cross-national
              analysis of the effects of the extent of international NGOs in a country in
              1978 on economic growth over the next twenty years.  This effect is expected to
              vary by regime type: NGOs may be more important in more authoritarian countries
              where they compensate for the weak civil society.  Other measures of
              institutional development may also determine the size of the NGO effect: data
              from the World Bank on the legal environment and on local administrative
              capacities will be tested as possible factors moderating the effectiveness of
              NGOs in promoting development.  A survey of World Bank development experts will
              be developed to assess the variation in state - NGO ties (e.g., state
              contracting with NGOs); measures of state-civil synergy based on these ties are
              expected to be associated with higher economic growth and social development.
