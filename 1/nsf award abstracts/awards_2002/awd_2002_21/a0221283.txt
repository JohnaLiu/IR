Abstract    :
              	This dissertation investigates privatization of energy and water utilities in
              Nicaragua and Costa Rica.  Privatization has become one of the leading
              strategies in international development circles and yet most of our knowledge
              is based on the experiences of developed countries.  This study will compare
              the recent experience in two Central American countries with different
              histories of privatization.  In Costa Rica, privatization has been slow and
              deliberate while Nicaragua has embraced international pressures to privatize
              quickly with less public participation.  Secondary data will be used to
              document the type and extent of privatization in each of the industries in each
              country.  Interviews with government, business, and union leaders in the two
              countries will evaluate who the important actors were in the transition to
              privatization, what the perceived benefits and costs have been as a result of
              privatization, and how state regulation has played a role in the water and
              energy industries.
