Abstract    :
              Award is for a project to install the first operational borehole seismometer in
              the deep ocean at the Hawaii-2 Observatory site. ODP Leg 200 drilled and cased
              a re-entry hole for this purpose during December 2001. This project will
              develop and test an improved seismic sonde, and develop a method and apparatus
              to lay a fiber optic cable from the borehole1.5 km to the Hawaii-2 Observatory
              junction box, using a deep submergence ROV. In addition, a thermistor string
              will placed in a nearby, uncased hole.  After installation of the seismometer,
              it will be tested and validated by comparison with land-based seismometers and
              with a seismometer located on the sea bed at the H2O site.
