Abstract    :
              	This dissertation investigates how communal riots in Ahmedabad, India, have
              created homogeneous ethnic neighborhoods where mixed neighborhoods previously
              existed.  The research will use geographical information systems to track the
              city's major religious processions and riots.  Archival records (e.g.,
              government inquiries, newspapers) will be examined to analyze the state's
              changing position on riots and processions.  Finally, semi-structured
              interviews with local leaders and residents living near the major procession
              route will be used to analyze the mechanisms that link the processions and
              communal violence with the creation of ethnically homogeneous neighborhoods.
