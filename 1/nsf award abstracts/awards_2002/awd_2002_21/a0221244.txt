Abstract    :
              	This dissertation investigates how sibling-headed households (SHH) in Namibia
              cope with the loss of both parents to AIDS.  In 2000, 16% of Namibian children
              were orphans.  The research will measure the actual and perceived support
              received by SHHs.  How much instrumental, emotional, and informational support
              are provided by the children's networks?  Which SHHs receive more support and
              how do contextual factors help explain those differences?   Interviews,
              observation, and surveys will help map children's networks and the resources
              they receive from them.
