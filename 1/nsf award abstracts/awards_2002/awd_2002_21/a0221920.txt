Abstract    :
              A program of upper atmosphere dynamics studies is proposed that involves work at
              the University of Pittsburgh, at the equatorial Airglow Observatory in
              Arequipoa, Peru, and at the midlatitude Millstone Hill Observatory in
              Massachusetts. Determinations of Doppler shifts and widths of nightglow
              emission lines will be made by upgraded Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI)
              instruments to yield velocities and temperatures. The FPIs are of both
              conventional and all-sky designs that make use of CCD detectors to provide
              greatly improved sensitivity. Accurate determinations of the Doppler shifts
              will be provided by zero velocity reference sources, either using the PIs newly
              developed oxygen afterglow reference source (OARS) that emits the forbidden OI
              630.0 and 557.7 nm lines or by more portable Secondary Standard sources that
              will be interferometrically calibrated against the OARS standard. The improved
              precision will permit accurate determinations of the (small) vertical
              velocities, supplementing the usual horizontal velocity determinations to
              provide a 3-dimensional characterization of the thermospheric flow.

For the
              equatorial measurements in Peru, the new, multi-wavelength capability of the
              FPI will broaden the ongoing 630 nm studies of upper thermosphere dynamics to
              include mesopause wind and temperature determinations via OH (731.6 nm)
              nightglow line studies. The all-sky FPI at Millstone Hill will be used to
              examine coupling effects between the midlatitude lower and upper thermosphere
              by sequential determinations of their wind and temperature fields using the
              557.7 nm and 630.0 nm airglow emissions. At both latitudes, the neutral
              dynamics results can be compared to the ionospheric dynamics measurements
              obtained by either the Jicamarca or the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter
              radar.
