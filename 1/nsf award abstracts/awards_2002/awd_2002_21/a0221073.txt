Funds are requested to analyze a large body of recently
              collected data from the Northwest Corner (NWC) of the Atlantic Ocean.  The PI
              will characterize the structure of the region as completely as possible.  He
              will construct mass, kinetic energy, and vorticity budgets, and will assess the
              spatial and temporal stability of the NWC.  He anticipates that significant
              temporal dependence of the flow structure occurs as the NWC sheds potential
              energy, which accumulates either as rings or subducting eddies.  He will
              explore two explanations for the broadening of the flow as it leaves the NWC -
              control by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge structure and competition between the zonal
              flow of the Subpolar Front and the meridional recirculation of waters leaving
              the NWC. The PI suggests that the two fronts observed within the Subpolar
              Frontal region reflect, through westward Rossby wave propagation, the two
              fracture zones of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge through which the Subpolar Front
              waters flow.  Available data is from Eulerian moorings, Lagrangian floats,
              hydrographic surveys, acoustic Doppler current profiler surveys, and satellite
              altimetry. Some rotating table experiments will be performed.
