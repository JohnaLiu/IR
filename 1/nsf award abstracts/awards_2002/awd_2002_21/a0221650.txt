Abstract    :
              Funds are recommended for continued analysis of a high quality geophysical data
              set collected by the PIs from the northern Gulf of California. The PIs will
              undertake a sequence stratigraphic analysis and integrate the results with an
              ongoing structural study of the region. It will also take advantage of data
              from industry sources that will provide the important stratigraphic control.
              The goal is to work out the transition from rifting to seafloor spreading and
              the history of extension in the Gulf. The study will also lead to an
              understanding of the kinematics of deformation in nascent axial basins.
