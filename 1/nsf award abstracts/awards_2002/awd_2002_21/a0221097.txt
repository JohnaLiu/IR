The PIs propose to upgrade the Low Light Auto-Radiometer (LoLAR).
              LoLAR is a submersible, radiometrically calibrated detector that was developed
              with joint funding from NSF and ONR. It is currently deployed on the Johnson-
              Sea-Link submersible, down to depths of 1000 m to measure downwelling
              irradiance with respect to the vertical distribution and migration patterns of
              mesopelagic organisms, as well as to make in situ measurements of
              bioluminescence. LoLAR combines the high quantum efficiency of a
              photomultiplier tube with a solid-state autocalibration circuit. The funds
              requested would be used to redesign LoLAR based on a proven auto-calibration
              concept, using recent technological developments that make it possible to
              greatly reduce the cost, size, and complexity of the system with the intent of
              developing a versatile instrument that can be made accessible to a wider range
              of users.
