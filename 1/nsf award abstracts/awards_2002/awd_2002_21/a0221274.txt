This Pan-American Advanced Studies Institutes (PASI)
              award, jointly supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will
              engage graduate and post-doctoral students in an intensive ten days of
              activities focusing on presentations by leading experts in green chemistry,
              discussions on policy and economic factors driving green chemistry, group
              problem-solving sessions, and hands-on laboratory experiments.  Organized by
              Dr. Mary Kirchhoff of the Green Chemistry Institute of the American Chemical
              society and Dr. Patrick Moyna of the Universidad de la Republica in Montevideo,
              Uruguay, this PASI will be held at the National University of Uruguay from July
              6-17, 2003 and will feature case studies and interactive discussions between
              participants and lecturers.  The proposed activities will provide participants
              with a foundation in green chemistry and will demonstrate the applicability of
              green chemistry principles to different branches of chemistry, as well as to
              specific industrial sectors.  In addition, this PASI will help to establish a
              network of scientists throughout the Americas who can promote green chemistry
              through their teaching, research, and industrial involvement.
