Abstract    :
              Genetically-determined, intentional elimination of specific cells, programmed
              cell death (PCD), is indispensable for the growth, development and survival of
              multicellular organisms.  In plants, PCD is an integral part of many aspects of
              development and responses to infectious agents/pathogens. Despite the essential
              nature of PCD, there are large gaps in the knowledge of the mechanistic details
              and molecular components controlling PCD in both plants and animals.  A model
              system to study plant PCD, using Arabidopsis thaliana and a purified fungal
              toxin, fumonisin B1, was developed during the Principal Investigator's tenure
              as an NSF postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Fred Ausubel's laboratory (Massachusetts
              General Hospital).  This Research Starter Award supports her independent career
              as a faculty member at the University of Nebraska. Dr. Stone will continue to
              pursue a classical genetics approach of identifying Arabidopsis thaliana
              mutants defective in fumonisin B1-induced PCD.  Identification of the genes
              responsible for this mutant phenotype will aid in unraveling the molecular
              mechanisms regulating PCD in plants.  Our results are likely to advance our
              basic understanding of the functions and regulatory mechanisms of PCD in plant
              growth, development, and response to pathogens.
