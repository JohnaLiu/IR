Abstract    :
              OCE-0221500

Elemental profiles in the suboxic zone of the Black Sea suggest
              that the upward flux of sulfide may be oxidized by manganese oxides rather than
              oxygen and that ammonia reacts with nitrate to produce N2.  In addition, the
              profiles suggest that Mn(II) oxidation occurs anaerobically, possibly coupled
              to denitrification.  However, the occurrence of the proposed reactions remains
              controversial.  A scientist from Scripps Institute of Oceanography, in
              collaboration with scientists from the University of Washington, the University
              of Delaware, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Russia and Ukraine,
              plans to carry out field work in the suboxic zone of the Black Sea, as well as
              laboratory culture experiments to test the hypothesis that Mn species act as a
              catalyst for oxidation of sulfide and ammonia and reduction of nitrate and
              nitrite.  The PI also will assess the microbial and abiogenic reaction rates of
              the oxidation of Mn (II) and reduction of Mn (III, IV) and assess how oxygen
              affects these processes.  In the laboratory, the distribution of bacteria and
              the genes involved in Mn(II) oxidation throughout the vertical and horizontal
              transects of the Black Sea also will be determined.  Lastly, the PI will
              ascertain the importance of lateral inputs versus in-situ processes in
              controlling the suboxic zone of the Black Sea.
