Abstract    :
              Under this award, the PI will continue participating in a collaborative study of
              the Cleft segment of the Juan de Fuca ridge. The field work has been and will
              continue to be done with MBARI vessels and ROVs, in active collaboration with
              D. Stakes, M. Tivey, and others. The PI's main responsibility is in sampling of
              volcanic rocks, interpreting volcanic land forms, and undertaking laboratory
              analyses of the rock samples. One field program occurred in 2000, and another
              will take place in 2002. The PI has additional rock samples from the area
              collected in 1990 and 1994. The PI proposes flow mapping of the axial and
              off-axis region with a variety of goals and objectives, one of which is to test
              the "split-ridge" model of Kappel and Ryan for tectonic and magmatic cycles
              forming the symmetrical land forms on either side of the present ridge axis.
              Axial and off-axis sampling out to ~6km (150 ka) will be used to test this
              idea, and elucidate the processes of crust creation and evolution in the
              near-axis region. A full laboratory program of major and trace element studies
              and isotopic studies are planned for ROV-collected and wax cored samples.
