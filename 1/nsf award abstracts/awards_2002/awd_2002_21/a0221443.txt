This award will support a workshop in Chapel Hill North
              Carolina to address problems associated with the subduction of the Nazca Plate
              below South America along the Northern Andes.  The purpose of the workshop is
              to develop a science plan and to organize and coordinate the diverse research
              objectives of  the NASCAR (Northern Andes Subduction of the Carnegie Ridge)
              initiative.  The NASCAR initiative involves researchers from a broad range of
              earth science (Geology, Geophysics, Geochemistry, Geodynamics) and coordination
              of goals and field logistics is critical to the success of the program.
