Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigator has conducted a reconnaissance, land-based seismic
              experiment designed to address questions about whether a mantle plume is
              associated with the Galapagos hotspot, whether the plume penetrates the mantle
              transition zone, the location of the hotspot/plume, the lateral dimensions of
              the hotspot/plume, and the form of hotspot-lithosphere interaction.  The
              present project will thoroughly analyze the seismic data, publish the results,
              and support scientific and educational collaborations with the Instituto
              Geofisico, Escuela Politecnica Nacional, Quito, and the Charles Darwin Research
              Station, Puerto Ayora.
