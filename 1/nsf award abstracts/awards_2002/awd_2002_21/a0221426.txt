Abstract    :
              This project will enhance a facility for calibration and testing of
              seismometers.  Specifically, the project will upgrade two existing,
              observatory-class shake tables with new electronics and interferometric optical
              displacement sensors.  The facility will be made available to all qualified
              researchers in the academic, government, and commercial sectors, and will be a
              invaluable community resource.
