Abstract    :
              This project proposes an investigation of the performance and continued
              viability of BGP system, including development of new techniques for
              correlating massive volumes of routing and topology data and tools to support
              modeling and prediction of routing behavior.  The research will include
              evaluation of incongruity between topology and articulated routing policy, and
              modeling of peering policy dynamics.
