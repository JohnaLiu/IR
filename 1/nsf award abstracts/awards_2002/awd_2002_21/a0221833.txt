              ABSTRACT

OCE-0221833

Much has been learned in recent years about the 
              biogeochemical cycling of trace elements and isotopic tracers, but progress has
              been  limited by the lack of any large-scale coordinated research effort in
              this area since the  GEOSECS program.  With NSF funding through this project,
              researchers at the Lamont-Dougherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University
              will convene a workshop to lay the foundation for a  coordinated international
              study of the biogeochemical cycles of trace elements and  isotopes used as
              "tracers " in oceanography.  Such a study would be disciplinary in the  sense
              that its primary objective would be to improve understanding of the marine 
              biogeochemical cycles of a suite of chemical tracers.   However, it would at
              the same time  interdisciplinary, in that it seeks to understand the complex
              couplings between the  biogeochemical cycles of trace elements and the
              biological and physical processes that  influence those cycles. The long-range
              objectives are  highly interdisciplinary, in that the improved understanding of
              these tracers will be of  immediate and substantial benefit to applications in
              biological, physical, and geological oceanography.

The proposed study has
              been termed GEOSECS-II to reflect the fact that many of  its objectives follow
              directly from those of the original GEOSECS program.  Furthermore, the proposed
              study will be conducted in the spirit of the original GEOSECS program with the
              appreciation that a global perspective is required to understand completely the
              cycling of chemical tracers within the ocean.
