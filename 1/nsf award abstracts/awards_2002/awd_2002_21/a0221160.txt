Abstract    :
              Under this award, the PIs will attempt to quantify the cold seep barite
              contribution to the marine sediment record. This will first involve quantifying
              the cold seep barite (an important carrier of Ba ) contribution to Ba and Ra
              fluxes within the San Clemente basin. Secondly, the PIs will quantify the
              effects of this source on the chemical signature of barite in the basin
              sediments. In general, the idea is to better understand the sources and sinks
              of Ba and its mass balance in preserved sediments in the San Clemente basin.
              The study will involve a field component to study the water column, deploy
              sediment traps, and collect core samples. The laboratory component consists of
              a very wide variety of elemental and isotopic techniques to characterize sample
              materials. The results of this general study of  the stability, transport and
              diagenesis of barite has numerous applications to a variety of related
              questions, and may result in better use of Ba as a paleoproxy of productivity.
