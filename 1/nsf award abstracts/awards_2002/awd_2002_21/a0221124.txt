Partial support is provided for an NSF-AFOSR-ARO workshop on
              materials in design, to be held April 10-12, 2002, in Tampa, Florida.  The
              purpose of the workshop is to explore the modeling and simulation processes of
              use in development and application of materials in design.  The goal is to
              eventually improve these processes to the point where the materials development
              cycle can be radically shortened to match the cycles for other steps in the
              design and manufacturing processes.  The results will significantly impact the
              development cycle for new products of many different types and should have
              substantial cost and safety benefits to society.
