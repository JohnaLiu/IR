Abstract    :
              This project attacks the problem of how to help those in states and districts
              understand and use data accurately and effectively.  The project uses a
              multi-dimensional approach to achieve three goals.  It: (1) targets training
              for 300 mathematics and science education reform leaders, (2) creates a
              national cadre of 50 data facilitators; and (3) provides intensive
              implementation support in four sites to build the knowledge base about the
              conditions that support the effective and collaborative use of data to guide
              educational improvement.

The project builds on the publication "Using
              Data/Getting Results," developed by TERC, and the materials synthesized in this
              publication will inform the workshops that the project implements. 
              Professional development activities will be carried out by WestEd, and the
              Goodman Research Group will conduct the summative evaluation.

There are
              partnerships with the Eisenhower Consortia, TIMSS-R Benchmarking jurisdictions,
              and NSF-funded systemic initiatives, including local systemic change projects,
              and dissemination and implementation sites who will work with this project.
