Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to develop general methods that automatically
              discover original and useful knowledge from historical or experimental data.
              Learning discriminants and descriptors associated with patterns extracted from
              the data is a central issue  in data mining. The project will develop
              techniques to do this. The results will be experimentally evaluated. In
              addition, an integrated data mining performance system will be developed.
