Abstract    :
              The University of Kentucky will provide engineering and computational equipment
              support to the AMPATH Project's First International Conference in Valdivia,
              Chile, April 10-12, 2002.  The main objective of the conference is to create an
              environment for AMPATH participants in Latin America, potential participants
              and those with a regional, hemispheric or international interest in the project
              to exchange ideas, form new partnerships and solidify existing
              collaborations.

The University of Kentucky had agreed to lend AMPATH the
              technology required for this conference to be accessible via the Access grid. 
              The Grid node will be connected to the REUNA network, and through this
              connection, to the UCAID Abilene network.  Interested participants worldwide,
              who are unable to attend personally, will be able to monitor the conference
              from their own sites, using the Access grid connection.

The conference
              support offered by UK includes shipping of the portable Access grid node,
              sending engineering staff to set up and maintain the equipment, as well ad
              international airfare, meals and lodging for the UK and AMPATH engineers, and
              the cost of the network connection to the Abilene backbone.  In addition, the
              University of Kentucky will receive technology support from the University of
              Illinois at Chicago, which will send equipment for its AGAVE (Access Grid
              Augmented Virtual Environment) system and an engineer to maintain this
              equipment.  The AGAVE system will connect to the Access Grid using the
              University of Kentucky's node.

The workshop will continue the exploration of
              connectivity of research and education networks between USA and South
              America.
