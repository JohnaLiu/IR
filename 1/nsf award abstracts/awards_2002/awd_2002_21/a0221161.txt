              ABSTRACT

OCE-0220215 / OCE-0221161 / OCE-0217164


In this project
              researchers at East Carolina University, Tulane University, and the University
              of Miami will attempt to a comprehensive approach to allow a  quantitative
              estimate of groundwater discharge and associated dissolved constituents to
              continental shelf waters.  A number of recent studies have shown that he
              transport of groundwater into coastal zones may be a significant process in the
               geochemical, nutrient, and carbon budgets of many marine nearshore waters.
              This project will  address the manner in which we may evaluate interactions
              between groundwater and surface  water a major river-dominated margin, the
              Mississippi River delta.

The research team will develop and apply a novel
              multiple-tracer approach involving the use of 222Rn/ 226Ra, 4He/3He/tritium,
              and short-lived radium isotopes as natural tracers of  groundwater flow to
              examine the margin adjacent to the Mississippi River. Water samples will  be
              collected from land-based groundwater wells near the Louisiana coast, deep
              porewaters via Kasten core, and surface waters from the lower Mississippi and
              adjacent continental shelf  throughout the project. To evaluate the connection
              between groundwater inputs and surface water tracer inventories, we team will
              construct a balance of all possible inputs and outputs of these natural
              tracers.. This field-based research will be used to develop and constrain a
              numerical hydrologic model for the study  area. Model results will be compared
              to estimates of groundwater flow obtained from  geochemical modeling.
