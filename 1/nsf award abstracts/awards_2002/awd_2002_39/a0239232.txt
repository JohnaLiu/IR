Abstract    :
              The performance and durability of microdevices in sliding contact is 
strongly
              dependent on interfacial phenomena like adhesion, friction, wear, 
and
              friction/vibration interaction.  It is becoming increasingly recognized 
that
              problems of stiction, adhesion and other critical phenomena such as 
bouncing
              vibrations occur dynamically in the presence of time-varying loads 
and
              motions.  As high-speed contacts operate under ever more challenging
              
conditions, contact or sticking can, in principle, occur at any
              time.

Intellectual Merit:  In this research, a systematic approach to
              dynamic 
contact studies of microsystems will be performed based on system
              
independent interfacial models that are coupled to the system dependent
              
dynamics of the interface.  A unique feature of the proposed approach is
              
the direct incorporation of the intermolecular (adhesion) forces and
              
kinetic friction models based on continuum mechanics into a dynamically
              
moving contact interface.  This will enable contact length scales from
              
micrometer to millimeter range and beyond to be covered.  Also, two unique
              
microtribometers will be built to measure key dynamic properties of
              
realistic miniature systems, and to conduct dynamic contact and friction
              
experiments for model verification and for studying such phenomena in
              
HDI's, and MEMS.  The outcome of this research is to: (a) Develop a
              
rigorous kinetic friction model for microdevices; (b) Use the model to
              
predict interfacial forces, damping and kinetic friction, thus providing a
              
powerful tool for controlling adhesion, friction and wear in microsystems;
              
(c) Predict the motions of contacting and pseudo-contacting HDI's and MEMS
              
as a function of design parameters like roughness, material properties, and
              
system dynamic properties, thus avoiding large vibrations and impact forces
              
and the associated catastrophic consequences.

Broader Impacts:  The
              research plan will advance the knowledge of tribology 
and microtribolgy,
              while the education plan of this research will 
disseminate it outside the
              research group and beyond the University.  The 
educational goals of
              increasing the awareness of micro/nanotribology and 
engineering in general,
              will be accomplished by: (a) establishing an 
outreach K-12 program targeting
              students grades 1 through 5 (cub-scouts) 
and high school students, (b)
              enhancing a basic tribology course using 
modern teaching techniques and also
              recruiting underrepresented students to 
work on projects and disseminate the
              information to the public, (c) 
developing a new graduate class in
              friction/vibration for miniature systems 
(microtribodynamics) that will
              include current research findings, and (d) 
actively participating in local
              and professional societies to promote 
engineering and tribology.

The
              proposed integrated research and education plan will advance further 
the
              development of micromachines, which has a major potential impact on 
society
              through transformation of a wide range of technologies, and at the 
same time
              increase the awareness and significance of friction and tribology
