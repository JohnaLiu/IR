Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research  (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on
              research and development of whole hand interaction with computer aided design
              (CAD) models. This project incorporates advanced numerical constraint
              optimization techniques, tessellated and algebraic collision detection
              algorithms, and CyberGlove-based input devices to interactively manipulate the
              kinematics of large commercial CAD models. Immersion will develop techniques
              for enforcing graphical non-penetration of virtual avatars with CAD models. 
              Grasping and manipulation-state machines will permit users to naturally grasp
              and manipulate CAD parts. Force feedback will be calculated and displayed to
              users with CyberForce hardware devices. A client-server infrastructure for
              offloading the computationally intense algorithms from desktop workstations
              will be developed. All CAD related development would occur in CATIA V5 from
              Dassault Systeme SA.

The technology has potential for a broad impact on
              virtual prototyping of consumer products and processes. Enabling real-time
              interaction with a virtual design will facilitate higher quality products with
              reduced development costs. Virtual prototyping of manufacturing processes will
              reduce laborer stress and injury by allowing detailed analysis of human factors
              before a factory work-cell is developed. Immersion will realize commercial
              returns from this project through a combination of increased hardware sales,
              product revenue, intellectual property licensing, and contract opportunities.
