Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to subsidize the travel and housing expenses of
              students selected to participate in the sixth SIGART/AAAI Doctoral Consortium,
              which will be held on July 28 and 29, 2002, in Edmonton, Canada. The consortium
              will be collocated with the Eighteenth National Conference on Artificial
              Intelligence (NCAI), which will be held from July 28 to August 1 in Edmonton.
              ACM/SIGART and AAAI together organized the first six Doctoral Consortia, which
              have also been collated with NCAI (except for last year, when the consortium
              was collocated with the International Joint Conference on Artificial
              Intelligence (IJCAI)). 
 
At the consortium, Ph.D. students who are doing
              their dissertations on AI-related topics present their proposed research, and
              receive feedback from a panel of established researchers as well as from the
              other students.  This provides the students with invaluable exposure to outside
              perspectives on their work, at a critical time in their research, and also
              enables them to explore their career objectives. There will also be a panel on
              career options as part of the consortium. This workshop contributes to the
              professional development of young scientists who will lead this growing field
              in the coming decades.
