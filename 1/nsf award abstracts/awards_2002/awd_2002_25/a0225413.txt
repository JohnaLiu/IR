              Abstract

The goal of the proposed research is to implement a
conversational
              intelligent environment
containing a distributed array of active cameras and
              other sensors,
and communicating with users via natural dialogue, augmented
              where useful
with imagery and pointing devices.
This artificial spatial
              intelligence, termed a
Voluble Intelligent Environment or VIE, will actively
              obtain information about,
and provide assistance within a real physical
              domain.

The project requires grounding natural language understanding
              in
machine perception.
A major difficulty is that outputs supplied
              by
current perceptual algorithms are too low-level
to serve as primitives for
              traditional understanding and reasoning systems.
To address this, the PIs will
              integrate the results of machine vision
and  other perceptual functions into
              mid-level representations termed
"perscripts", which represent items of
              perceptual information of the sort that
would typically be described by a
              phrase or simple sentence.

The project also requires advances
              in
distributed systems technology to permit the
various perceptual,
              computational, and communication components to
be efficiently and flexibly
              configured.
The integration framework will be based on
a prototype
              distributed resource interface, InterWeave,
developed at the University of
              Rochester.
Interweave provides an efficient implementation
of a network-wide
              global name/address space that directly supports
the proposed approach to
              grounding language in perception.

The work will be validated in
a
              ``Household Assistant'' application that provides occupants of a
``smart
              house'' with information useful in activities of
daily living (such as ``where
              did I leave my glasses?'' or
``did I take my meds?'').
This application is
              being developed in conjunction with the University
of Rochester Center for
              Future Health.
It addresses needs of
the elderly and the disabled, and has
              the potential to have a significant
economic impact as part of an overall
              system that unloads caregivers for
this population.
