Abstract    :
              
A sensor should be sensitive, selective, reversible, and inexpensive.  We have
              demonstrated, for the first time, a highly sensitive, rapidly responding,
              conductiometric device based upon the application of a stabilized porous
              silicon interface.  This sensor, which operates at an extremely low bias
              voltage, at room temperature, is now able to detect gaseous HCl, NH3, and NO
              (L. Seals, et al,  J. Appl. Phys., 91, 2519 (2002)] at a level between 10 and
              100 ppm (calibrated).  The sensor, which has not yet been optimized, is simple
              in design, operates with a rapid response and is reversible.  It can be made
              selective with surface coatings and can be integrated into arrays with
              measurement electronics.  The key to the sensor response is a low resistance
              contact made to the silicon through electroless metallization of a modified
              porous silicon surface, resulting in contact resistances of less than 100O's,
              rather than the 200 kO - MO resistances normally observed with porous silicon
              devices. 

We propose to investigate the sensor response as a function of
              structure and interface variation and establish the sensing mechanism in order
              to optimize sensor design and enhance sensitivity, selectivity, and response
              time. As a means of increasing sensitivity, we will study the effect of surface
              morphology, in a combined microporour/nanoporous structure, on response.  To
              increase selectivity, surface coatings and selective membranes will be placed
              in combination with the sensor.  Alternatively we will couple the sensor to a
              micro-GC column as a detector or in a multiple array format within the column
              itself.
