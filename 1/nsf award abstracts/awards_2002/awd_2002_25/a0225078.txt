Abstract    :
              West Virginia University is teaming with Step-Up for Women to prepare a full
              proposal.  The objective of the proposed project to be implemented beginning in
              fall 2003 is to increase the number of women entering and remaining in the
              computer science major at West Virginia University. The research question to be
              addressed is whether an adaptation of the approaches used by Jane Margolis and
              Allan Fisher at Carnegie Mellon University [Margolis, 2002] and by Jane Zimmer
              Daniels, formerly at Purdue University and now at The Henry Luce Foundation,
              are applicable at a university in a rural state with modest admissions
              requirements. Central to the work is a two semester course sequence which will
              be discovery-based with a real-world orientation. The results of this work
              should be transferable to colleges and universities in similar states seeking
              to increase all students and particularly female students in computer
              science.
