The PIs will develop integrated microstructures and circuitry
              for single cell
capture and characterization.  Each of these "clinics" will
              consist of a
cell-sized cavity, or microvial, and a lid.  The lid can be
              opened and
closed by hinges constructed from polypyrrole microactuators which
              link
rigid plates to the substrate.  These clinics will be fabricated
              on
conventional bulk silicon as well as on ultra-thin
              silicon-on-sapphire
(SOS) substrates.  Integration of the microstructures with
              CMOS
electronics allows integrating sensors, detection, and
              stimulation
circuitry together, while SOS provides a transparent substrate
              which
allows optical measurements of cell activity within the chamber. 
              Sensing
modalities will be tailored for specific applications and
              include:
impedance measurements, extracellular recording and stimulation
              of
electrically active cells, optical measurements, and current or
              voltage
clamp measurements using microfabricated needles within the chamber. 
              
The potential applications are numerous, spanning a spectrum from
              detailed
physiological studies of specific mechanisms to whole cell studies
              of
ecology or developmental biology to collecting concentrated
              cell
secretions to statistical studies of assayed cell properties.
