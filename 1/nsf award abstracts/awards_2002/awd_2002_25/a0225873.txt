Abstract    :
              This proposal supports a highly visible dissemination outlet for grant holders
              in the Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) and Advanced
              Technological Education (ATE) Programs. The PI is organizing a poster session
              at the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) Annual Conference in
              June of each of the next three years (2003-2005). He is inviting grant award
              recipients from one or two years earlier to submit an abstract for inclusion in
              the poster session.
