This award is jointly funded by the Divisions of Materials
              Research and Mathematical Sciences.  It supports a symposium to be held at
              Carnegie Mellon University on April 11-12, 2003, entitled "Moving Boundary
              Problems in Physics, Mathematics and Materials Science."  The symposium
              recognizes the many contributions to this interdisciplinary field by Professor
              Robert Sekerka .  Funds will be used primarily to assist young researchers to
              attend.
