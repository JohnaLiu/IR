Abstract    :
              This award supports participants in The Third IMACS International Conference on
              Nonlinear Evolution Equations and Wave Phenomena: Computation and Theory, held
              at the University of Georgia on 7-10 April 2003.  The interdisciplinary
              meeting, sponsored by the International Association for Mathematics and
              Computers in Simulation, focuses on computational and theoretical aspects of
              nonlinear waves and optical solitons, and brings together researchers in
              applied mathematics, computational mathematics, and applied physics.  Topics of
              interest include theoretical aspects of solitons and integrability, nonlinear
              waves in fluids, symbolic and numeric computations for integrable evolution
              equations, numerical methods for nonlinear waves (symplectic, IST and Fast
              Fourier methods, adaptive methods of lines, parallel algorithms), nonlinear
              waves in optics, dispersion managed solitons in optical fibers, and advances in
              modeling optical fiber transmission systems.  The interdisciplinary meeting
              will provide excellent opportunities for communication and collaboration
              between senior and junior researchers.
