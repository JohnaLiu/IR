Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

The workshop will bring together leaders from industry, government,
              academe and the financial community to explore in more detail their views on
              the future of nanotechnology.  The workshop will draw attendees mainly from the
              Southern US region (Arizona - Florida) and will focus on the importance of
              nanotechnology to five areas of application: (1) human capital (education and
              training), (2) energy, (3) molecular electronics, (4) medicine/life sciences,
              and (5) aerospace.  Duncan Hall on the rice University campus.
