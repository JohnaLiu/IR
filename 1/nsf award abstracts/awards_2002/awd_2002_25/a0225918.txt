Abstract    :
              This Production Realization and Environment Manufacturing Innovative Systems
              (PREMISE) project is aimed at establishing the major effects of spray cooling
              under a wide range of cutting conditions, tool geometry and three major
              aluminum work materials (356, 380 and 390) in most commonly known automotive
              machining operations covering turning, milling, and drilling. The effects of
              influencing parameters such as the fluid (and mist) flow rate, air pressure,
              direction of spray (and the nozzle position), type and composition of fluid,
              etc., are to be studied and compared for machining performance measures such as
              tool-wear/tool-life, cutting forces, chip-forms/chip breakability, surface
              roughness, etc. A sensitivity analysis will be made in order to identify the
              major influencing parameters and relevant empirical relationships will be
              derived for practical applications. At the end, a full range of validation is
              proposed. The project will be conducted in four overlapping phases in twelve
              months. 

The findings of this project will validate and establish the
              feasibility of using spray cooling to replace conventional flood cooling in
              specific applications, thus avoiding the disadvantages such as extremely
              harmful environmental pollution, negative influence on personnel health,
              increased production costs and poor energy efficiency, etc., prevalent in flood
              cooling. The machining performance will not be compromised in spray cooling
              applications. The identification of the primary influencing parameters in spray
              cooling is important for machining process planning.  The experimental data
              generated and the relevant empirical relationships established from this
              project will also serve as the basis for developing analytical models for use
              in the optimization of machining processes.
