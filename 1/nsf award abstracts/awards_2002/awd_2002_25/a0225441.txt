Abstract    :
              The project will investigate the extent and impact of tropospheric-stratospheric
              exchange associated with convective storms. The transfer of momentum, energy,
              and trace constituents between the troposphere and stratosphere profoundly
              influences the dynamical and chemical climatology and variability of the
              stratosphere and upper troposphere. Dynamical interaction between the two
              regions can moreover influence weather in the Northern winter. Drs. Holton and
              Durran (Univ. of Washington, Seattle) will use a cloud-resolving numerical
              model to analyze gravity wave generation and propagation, resulting from
              orographically generated convection. The project will also advance the 3-D
              modeling of tropical and extratropical storms to better understand the
              transport of trace chemicals from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere,
              and across the tropopause. The PIs expect to be able to distinguish between
              transport resulting from transient lifting of the tropopause and that resulting
              from irreversible transfer across the tropopause. Improved modeling of the
              mechanisms and distribution of troposphere-stratosphere coupling should lead to
              more accurate parameterizations of momentum and chemical transports in global
              weather and climate models, and advance the understanding of the stratospheric
              general circulation, ozone chemistry, and tropospheric weather and climate.
