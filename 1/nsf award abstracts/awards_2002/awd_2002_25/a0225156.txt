              ABSTRACT 

New Directions in Science and Engineering Ethics Curriculum
A
              Workshop at Indiana University, June 10 and 11, 2002,
Hosted by the
              Association for Practical and Professional Ethics

Brian E. Schrag

This
              grant supports a one and one-half day workshop to explore new directions in
              science and engineering ethics curriculum, focusing primarily on web-based
              courses.  The fifteen invited participants are leaders in research ethics
              education or are expert in the use of computer technology to create on-line
              research ethics curriculum.  Participants will share their experience and ideas
              concerning objectives of research ethics education: new directions in content
              and pedagogy, and best uses of computer technology, combined effectively with
              other pedagogical approaches.

Participants will recommend standards and
              guidelines for NSF grant applications that propose curriculum projects in
              research ethics, especially on-line curriculum.  The main guidelines that
              derive from this project will be posted on the web site of the NSF program
              Societal Dimensions of Engineering, Science and Technology.  The background
              papers from which the standards are derived will appear in appropriate
              publications where they can benefit the broader audience of professionals in
              the field of ethics education.
