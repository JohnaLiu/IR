A group of engineers specializing in multiplex sensors and
              computer scientists specializing in computational geometry will jointly develop
              physical and logical geometric processing to improve sensor network efficiency.
              The efficiency of sensor system may be defined as a ratio of the number of
              sensor states to the number of system output states. An efficiency ratio near 1
              dramatically reduces the computation and communication costs of sensing.
              Reduced computational loads are critical to real-time operation. Multiplex
              sensing (meaning non-isomorphic mapping between the source state and sensor
              pixels) is the critically enabling feature of efficient systems. Geometric
              structure is used to encode multiplex sensitivity. 

This project  may lead
              to motion and tracking sensors for human-computer interfaces at much lower cost
              and with much lower computational complexity than current technology.

This
              project will leverage sensor network testbeds developed through the Duke
              Information Spaces Project (DISP), including Argus, a 128 video camera array on
              a 14 meter ring connected in parallel to a Beowulf processing cluster, 5,000
              square foot pyroelectric and acoustic sensor volume in the Smith tobacco
              Warehouse and ad hoc sensor networks in the Duke Forest.
