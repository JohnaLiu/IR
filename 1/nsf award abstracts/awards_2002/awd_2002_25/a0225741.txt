Abstract    :
              The change in biology to a data driven science has meant that new educational
              needs have become apparent. Primary among these is the skills associated with
              biological informatics, skills in understanding algorithms and databases. This
              workshop will draw together a group of scientist with a background and
              experience in developing curricula in bioinformatics to identify best practices
              and the challenges that remain. The programs represented at the meeting cover
              the US and, by holding it in association with a major meeting, will help to
              raise awareness of the importance of education and training in biological
              informatics. A report of the meeting will be made available on the web.
