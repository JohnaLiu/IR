NSF Program : 1544      GENDER DIVERSITY IN STEM EDUCA

Program Ref : 9178,SMET,
Abstract    :
              The Black Hills Special Services Cooperative, South Dakota, is planning for the
              development of a research-based professional development model designed to help
              middle school teachers appropriately integrate technology into mathematics and
              science content in a way that raises the interest and persistence of female
              students in STEM.

In this model, professional development for technology
              integration will be the vehicle used to address and apply principles of gender
              equity at the middle school classroom level. As middle school teachers learn
              how to appropriately use technology to add value to existing mathematics and
              science curriculum and methodology, they will do so through the "lens" of
              gender equity.

Target participants in this project will initially include 30
              middle school teachers of mathematics, science and computer science in five
              selected middle schools in western South Dakota which serve approximately 2300
              students in grades 5-8.

Collaborating partners in the planning proposal are
              Technology and Innovations in Education (TIE), Rapid City, South Dakota; the
              Center for the Advancement of Mathematics and Science (CAMSE) at Black Hills
              State University, Spearfish, South Dakota; the Midwest Alliance for
              Professional Learning and Leadership (MAPLE), Rapid City South Dakota; and the
              following pre-K school districts in western South Dakota: Belle Fourche,
              Lead-Deadwood, Meade, Spearfish, and Todd County. These districts represent a
              cross section of South Dakota's student population.
