Abstract    :
              This action funds the payment of international dues for the U.S. National
              Committee for SCOPE, Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment, an
              international scientific organization charged with advancing knowledge of the
              interactions between humans and the environment.  Forty countries are members
              of SCOPE, each with a national committee that operates through the country's
              national academy of sciences.  SCOPE was founded as, and continues to be, an
              important forum for identification of and recommendations for international
              scientific discussions of environmental situations affecting humans.
