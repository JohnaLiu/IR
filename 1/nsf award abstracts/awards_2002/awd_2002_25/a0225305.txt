Abstract    :
              The University of Massachusetts at Amherst and the University of Pittsburgh are
              jointly planning to establish an NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center (I/UCRC) for e-Design and Realization of Engineered Products and
              Systems.  The Center's mission is to serve as a center of excellence in IT
              enabled design and realization of discrete manufactured products by envisioning
              where information is the lifeblood of an enterprise and collaboration is the
              hallmark that seamlessly integrates design, development, testing, manufacturing
              and servicing of products around the world.

The proposed Center, a fusion of
              expertise and resources from the already successful Center for e-Product Design
              & Realization at the University of Pittsburgh and the Center for Manufacturing
              Productivity at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, is a joint effort
              to achieve synergy in the development of the enabling technologies to support
              the new project development paradigm.  The proposed I/UCRC would leverage the
              existing talent faculty from complementary engineering disciplines,
              infrastructure and experience of each university.
