Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

Basic properties such as the particle shape and size distribution
              have significant influence on the processing of particulate in various chemical
              and pharmaceutical applications.  For example, the shape and size distribution
              of crystals used in pharmaceutical tablet production have a strong influence on
              compaction and dissolution properties of the product.  This proposal focuses on
              understanding and modeling the variation in the size and shape distribution due
              to breakage of dry crystals in various applications.  The objectives of the
              proposal are to investigate the effect of the system operating conditions on
              crystal shape distribution due to breakage and to develop a novel procedure
              quantitatively measure changes in particle shape and size in a stirred vessel
              due to breakage.  A stirred tank is used to obtain data for the rate of
              breakage in terms of various process parameters.  The data is used to establish
              new and effective models for multidimensional population balance for the
              variation in size and shape distribution.
