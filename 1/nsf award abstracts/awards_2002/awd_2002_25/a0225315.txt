Abstract    :
              Light Field Compression and Streaming
In image-based rendering, a large set of
              conventional 2-D images is used 
to render arbitrary views of a 3-D scene. The
              images capture the light 
field around the scene. Since hundreds or thousands
              of individual images 
are required, the data sets are huge, unless they are
              compressed. A 
particularly important application of light field compression
              is the 
streaming of light fields stored on an Internet media server. For
              
interactive viewing, this requires a framework to decide, which packets of
              
compressed light field data to send over the network, and at what
              time.

This project proposes to develop and study new techniques for
              efficient 
light field compression and interactive streaming. For compression,
              a 
novel, elegant disparity-compensated 4-D wavelet transform will be
              
investigated that avoids the re-sampling problem of previous
              
disparity-compensated wavelet schemes by incorporating the disparity
              
compensation into a sequence of lifting steps. For light field streaming,
              
the proposed work will build on recent advances in rate-distortion
              
optimized packet scheduling and extend the state-of-the-art to interactive
              
3-D viewing.

The project is expected to have broad impact for networked
              3-D interactive 
graphics applications, ranging from distance education and
              remote 
visualization of scientific and medical data sets, to Internet
              e-commerce 
and networked video games.
