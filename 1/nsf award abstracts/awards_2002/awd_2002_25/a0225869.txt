The project  is
              about a planning visit for developing collaborative research work in optical
              dipole traps for ultracold atoms with researchers at Korea University in Korea.
              The proposed work is to address the issue of creating a perturbation limited
              environment for conducting precision measurements by studying two regimes of
              optical dipole force trapping.
