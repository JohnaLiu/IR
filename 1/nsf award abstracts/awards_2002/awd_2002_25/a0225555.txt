Abstract    :
              This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to enable additional observations
              and analysis during the NASA-sponsored "Matador" project of the University of
              Arizona.  Planned for May-July at a site in the Arizona desert, the purpose of
              Matador is to document the characteristics of dust devils, as measured by
              remote and in-situ sensors.  Vortex circulations in the atmospheric boundary
              layer, of which dust devils are a visible example, carry heat and particulate
              matter (aerosols) from the earth's surface into the atmosphere, though the
              physics of these circulations and the contribution they make to the overall
              vertical transport of heat and mass are not understood.  This grant enables the
              deployment of additional instruments for flux measurements and provides for
              data analysis by Dr. Renno, students, and collaborators.  Outcomes of the
              research will be quantitative estimates of the heat and mass transport by
              vortices in the boundary layer and the data needed to test theoretical models
              of dust devils.  This supplement to the Matador project is a sufficient
              incentive to entrain the collaboration of boundary-layer researchers from
              academic and research institutions in Mexico and The Netherlands.
