Abstract    :
              This award, under the auspices of the Small Grants for Exploratory Research
              (SGER) program, will establish a unique proxy isotopic record for the lower
              free troposphere of the western Pacific convection system.  This system plays a
              dominant role in the climate of the tropical Pacific. 

The study site on
              Lake Guam is situated adjacent to the Pacific warm pool and at an elevation of
              3600 meters on the high plateau of the Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea (6
              degrees S and 147 degrees E).  The researcher will generate and calibrate
              isotopic records of Oxygen-18 and Carbon-13 from carbonate sediments in Lake
              Guam to instrumental records of temperature, humidity, and winds from
              historical atmospheric soundings in the western tropical Pacific. 

The
              rationale for considering this award is the high-risk challenge of validating
              the first high altitude isotopic record of the lower troposphere in the western
              tropical Pacific and developing the first proxy vertical soundings of this
              convection system.
