Dr.
              Szalay is awarded funds at Johns Hopkins University to continue expanding,
              advertising, and evaluating its pilot website, Skyserver
              (http://skyserver.sdss.org).  This site makes data from the Sloan Digital Sky
              Survey (SDSS) freely available to anyone with Internet access. By the time the
              SDSS is finished in 2005, it will have mapped one-quarter of the entire sky in
              detail, determining the positions and absolute brightnesses of more than 100
              million celestial objects. It will also take spectra of more than a million
              galaxies and quasars.  Dr. Szalay has built a team of astronomers, programmers,
              science writers, education experts, and teachers in order to reach a wide
              audience. They have designed several tools to allow students and the general
              public to easily and intuitively access SDSS data. They are also designing
              several interactive educational projects in which students use SDSS data to
              learn concepts from astronomy. For example, students will make Hubble diagrams
              to show the expansion of the universe, calculate temperatures of stars from
              spectra, and look for asteroids in SDSS images. All projects will include
              teachers guides that give complete solutions, advice on teaching the projects
              to a class, and applicability to national education standards.
