Abstract    :
              This workshop will bring together key experts from academia and industry to
              explore new ideas and research directions for network research and
              infrastructure in wired and wireless networks.  The new ideas and research
              directions proposed are at least a generation beyond what is currently pursued
              in the research arena today.
