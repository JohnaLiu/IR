Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposal is to extend the lifetime of wireless sensor networks
              by addressing the hotspot problem for a given application set. We propose to
              develop a collection of techniques, each addressing one particular aspect of
              the problem:
o	Ad-hoc routing techniques to distribute the traffic over the
              complete network rather than along a number of bottleneck traffic
              lanes.
o	Network topology management to equalize traffic density over the
              network.
o	Aggregation and distributed source-coding to compress the traffic
              flow in the vicinity of the monitor node.
Algorithmic approaches to each of
              these problems are being proposed. Their impact will be quantified using a
              combination of analysis, simulation, and hardware prototyping on a smart
              building scenario.
