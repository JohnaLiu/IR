Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to conduct a wide-ranging program of research on the mid -
              and low-latitude ionosphere.  The research involves observations to be made
              with a small coherent scatter radar at Clemson University and with the
              Jicamarca incoherent scatter radar (ISR) and the JULIA radar near Lima, Peru. 
              Topics to be investigated include midlatitude sporadic E ionization layers,
              lower thermospheric winds in the equatorial E region, and the response of the
              low latitude ionosphere and plasmasphere to substorms.  These topics have
              overtones for the National Space Weather initiative as well as for the
              CEDAR/TIMED project and several other CEDAR initiatives (Topside, POLITE).  The
              proposal has experimental and theoretical elements and should result in the
              development of new radar hardware, new numerical codes, and an improved and
              enhanced radar database.
