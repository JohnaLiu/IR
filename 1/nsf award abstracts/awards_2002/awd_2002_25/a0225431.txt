For the purposes of public safety, health and wellness, it
              is often critical to have
available smart sensors that can detect and identify
              toxic and poisonous gases in the air. Here the PIs seek low cost arrays of SAW
              gas sensors clustered as a network node that can be placed and operated with
              minimal supervision, yield continuous real time monitoring capability through
              the network and are based on well established CMOS/MEMS technology. Since the
              sensors are fabricated employing CMOS technology, additional signal processing
              circuitry can easily be integrated into the chip thereby readily providing
              functions, such as, multiplexing and analog-to-digital conversion, i.e.,
              Systems On a Chip (SOC). The proposed CMOS design offers other potential
              benefits, such as, temperature drift control and noise immunity. The chips will
              be designed at The George Washington University and fabricated by the MOSIS
              service. Select post-fabrication steps will be performed by the MEMS Exchange
              and the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), Chemistry Division. This proposal
              addresses the critical research issues, estimated time line of tasks and
              educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.
