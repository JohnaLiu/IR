This proposal seeks support for the design and development of
              networked sensors capable of operating in aqueous environments. Development of
              an aqueous network sensor technology is a challenging prospect, requiring
              careful design and systematic integration of the sensor platforms incorporated
              into the network nodes for operation in liquids, packaging of the sensors for
              an aqueous environment, and burst-spread acoustic communication schemes (pulse
              modulation of a steady state carrier) able to compensate for reflections due to
              the water-ground and water-air interface. The PI will design and integrate
              sensor technologies capable of aqueous operation with acoustic based
              communication technologies and data processing protocols to achieve a network
              sensor technology able to autonomously, continuously, and in-real time monitor
              streams, lakes, ocean bays, liquid streams in processing plants, etc.   He
              proposes to integrate arrays of magnetoelastic sensors into the nodes for
              measurement of liquid chemical composition, liquid density and viscosity, pH
              and temperature. Beyond helping to ensure water quality, the aqueous networked
              sensors would be a tremendous tool for biologists seeking to monitor the
              temperature, flow characteristics, and chemical environment of lakes and,
              ultimately when the technology is fully developed, oceans.  Without question a
              viable networked sensor technology for aqueous environments would find great
              application for environmental monitoring, industrial process control, homeland
              security and scientific discovery.
