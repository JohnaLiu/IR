Abstract    :
              The objective of this research project is to understand how
product development
              organizations use environmental information in
their decision-making during
              the design of a new product.  The research
views product development as an
              information flow governed by
decision-makers who must act under time and
              budget constraints.  The
project will conduct an exploratory study to describe
              the flow of
information related to environmental decision-making in the
              product
development activities of an electronics manufacturing company. 
              The
project will construct a long-term collaborative research agenda
              to
improve environmentally responsible product development, particularly
by
              integrating design decision support tools into other product
development
              activities.

If successful, this research will yield new models that guide
              the
development of powerful decision support tools (for specific
              decision-
makers) and the rational and systematic deployment of these tools
              across
the entire product development organization.  Ultimately, this will
              reduce
the time and cost of environmentally responsible product
              development
across a range of industrial sectors.  The research will benefit
              society
by helping manufacturing companies develop energy-efficient
              and
environmentally benign products.
