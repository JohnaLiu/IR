Abstract    :
              This proposal will fund a one-day workshop that will present NSF-funded research
              on science parks and gather experts in the area in order to stimulate an
              assessment of recent findings, as well as likely directions of future research.
               The workshop will also explore policy needs for national-level indicators on
              science parks.
