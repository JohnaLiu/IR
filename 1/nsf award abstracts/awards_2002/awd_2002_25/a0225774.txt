Abstract    :
              This small grant for exploratory research will support development of novel
              computer systems that will enhance the quality of life of people suffering from
              Alzheimer's Disease and similar cognitive disorders. Assisted Cognition systems
              use ubiquitous computing and artificial intelligence technology to replace some
              of the memory and problem-solving abilities that have been lost by an
              Alzheimer's patient. Assisted Cognition systems: sense aspects of an
              individual's location and environment, both outdoors and at home, relying on a
              wide range of sensors such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS), active badges,
              motion detectors, and other ubiquitous computing infrastructure; learn to
              interpret patterns of everyday behavior, and recognize signs of distress,
              disorientation, or confusion, using techniques from state estimation, plan
              recognition, and machine learning; offer help to patients through various kinds
              of interventions including speech and natural language processing; and alert
              human care-givers in case of danger.

Two concrete examples of the Assisted
              Cognition systems that will be developed are an activity compass that helps
              reduce spatial disorientation both inside and outside the home, and an adaptive
              prompter that helps patients carry out multi-step everyday tasks. This project
              will explore an emerging area that could be of great humanitarian, commercial,
              social, and scientific importance in the coming decades.
