Abstract    :
              Information security has become a critical concern of both government and
              industry, and numerous groups have independently called for more and better
              research and education efforts in computer security.  During the first computer
              security education workshop (1997) attended by industry and government
              agencies, there was a clear call to action for universities to create programs
              in information security.  In response to these demands, faculty members from
              several universities have been working to increase both education and research
              in the area of information assurance.  This initiative proposes to build on the
              existing strengths of the faculty and universities involved by creating the
              Cyber Protection Center.  The Center will be one of the first facilities
              dedicated to creating a simulated Internet for the purpose of researching,
              designing, and testing cyber defense mechanisms.  The Laboratory will also be
              used to test key components of the critical infrastructure.
