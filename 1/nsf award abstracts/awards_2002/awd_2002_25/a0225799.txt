Abstract    :
              Hysteresis is a ubiquitous phenomenon arising in diverse
areas of engineering.
              In applications, it is closely linked to
energy dissipation, and it is
              associated with quasi-static
memory-dependent behavior. Many applications
              involve
rate-dependent hysteresis, which merges quasi-static hysteresis
with
              fully dynamic behavior, thereby yielding quasi-static
hysteresis as a limiting
              feature of dynamic system properties. In
the proposed research, we plan to
              develop differential models for
rate-dependent hysteresis and use these models
              for nonlinear
system identification and adaptive feedback control. The
              proposed
research will simplify and extend existing hysteresis models
              and
provide new techniques for identification and control of
hysteresis in
              diverse applications.
