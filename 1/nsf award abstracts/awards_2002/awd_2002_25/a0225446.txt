Abstract    :
              The vision of this proposed work is to create more versatile  information
              systems by using autonomous and distributed sensor networks:  hundreds of small
              sensors, equipped with limited memory and actuation capabilities will
              autonomously organize themselves and move  to track a source and convey
              information about its location to  a human user, and to the rest of the team.
              Such distributed active  sensor networks are pervasive computing systems, 
              well-suited for tasks in extreme environments,  especially when the
              environmental model and the task specifications  are uncertain and the system
              has to adapt to it. 

To create active sensor networks capable of such
              applications, a  fundamental goal of this research is to develop a science base
              for distributed sensor network control and information gathering and
              coordination.
This is a considerable challenge, which we propose to meet by
              the  synergistic integration of the following directions of work:  (1) new
              ideas for  communication in sensor networks; (2) new ideas for developing
              adaptive  active control and coordination in sensor networks; (3) new ideas for
               information gathering and aggregation in sensor networks; and (4) experiments 
              grounded on realistic scenarios that measure empirically the performance  and
              scalability of the proposed communication and control algorithms.

More
              specifically, the central challenges for this proposed work are  focused on
              developing, implementing and evaluating a suite of scalable  network protocols
              that (1) guarantee message delivery; (2) are  fault tolerant; (3) maximize the
              network lifetime; and (4) are adaptive to  the environment and to the task.
