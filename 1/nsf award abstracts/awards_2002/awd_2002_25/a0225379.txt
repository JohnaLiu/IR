Abstract    :
              
The Energy-Aware Articulation in Sensor Networks program will develop and
              demonstrate a fundamental, new distributed sensing capability that combine
              intelligent nodes with articulated electromagnetic communication systems,
              articulated sensors, and articulated energy collection devices.  This program
              directly addresses primary, long-standing problems in distributed wireless
              sensors with a comprehensive, new approach.

Distributed, networked, wireless
              sensor systems are being developed and deployed for diverse applications
              ranging from physical security to environmental monitoring.  In the past,
              conventional systems have been deployed in a static fashion with their critical
              components (communication, sensing, and energy collection) being fixed to the
              sensor node package.  This limits the antenna structure choices and sensor
              systems to only general purpose, fixed systems that may operate at far from an
              optimal configuration with severe limitations on antenna gain and link energy
              requirements as well as sensor event detection and identification capability. 
              

The Energy-Aware Articulation in Sensor Networks program will develop the
              principles for a direct solution to these system limitations through a
              convergence of actuator principles, energy-aware articulated networking,
              articulated distributed sensing, and distributed computing fundamentals. This
              will be based on distributed sensor node systems in an open, shared testbed
              that include nodes carrying articulated antenna structures (for optimized, high
              gain communication), articulated sensors (for optimized and cooperative event
              detection), and articulated solar energy collection (for extending operating
              life.)  The combination of these capabilities promises to impact nearly all the
              system characteristics from deployment through detection capability.
