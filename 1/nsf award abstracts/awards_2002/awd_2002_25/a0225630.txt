Abstract    :
              A Center for Computational Biological Physics is established at the University
              of California, San Diego as part of the Information Technology Research
              Initiative (ITR). This ITR Center, located in La Jolla, CA and operating as a
              partnership between UC San Diego, the San Diego Supercomputer Center, the
              Scripps Research Institute and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, will
              pioneer new computational paradigms in support of this overall goal.  This is
              critical as biology evolves into a data-rich predictive science and
              increasingly turns to complex systems physics for help in in developing the
              necessary conceptual underpinnings and the concomitant calculational
              strategies.
 
Specifically, the Center will focus on two major projects, one
              each at the supra-molecular and sub-cellular scales. The first involves
              combining molecular dynamics with powerful electrostatic solvers so as to
              enable the study of large-scale biological machines. The system to be used as a
              testbed is the ribosome, where the recently determined structure allows for the
              application of these ideas. The second involves extending the MCell concept,
              originally developed for synapse simulations, into a broadly useful tool for
              studying sub-cellular-cellular scale signal transduction processes. Here the
              target applications concern calcium dynamics in cardiac cells and its control
              by hormonal action. In addition to these research goals, the Center will be
              actively involved in training a new class of computational scientist, one who
              can directly communicate with experimentalists and focus the computation so as
              to answer meaningful questions for these systems. Finally, the ITR Center is
              directly coupled to a complementary effort, the Physics Frontiers Center for
              Theoretical Biological Physics, which is focused on the conceptual advances
              that will eventually serve as a source of new demand for novel computational
              strategies.

The ITR award is jointly funded by the Physics, Materials
              Research and Chemistry Divisions of the NSF.
