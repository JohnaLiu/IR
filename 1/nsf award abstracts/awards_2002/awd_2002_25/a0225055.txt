Abstract    :
              The Research Site of the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center
              (I/UCRC) entitled "Repair of Buildings and Bridges with Composites (RB2C)" at
              North Carolina State University is an extension to the currently active I/UCRC
              located at the University of Missouri-Rolla.  The research site at North
              Carolina State will focus on addressing the needs of the construction industry
              in development of new and innovative structural components as well as
              strengthening/repair methods for existing structures using advanced composite
              materials.  The primary research activities of the site will involve:  use of
              the three-dimensional weaving technology, developed by the College of Textiles
              at North Carolina State University in cooperation with the textile industry and
              the fiber producer; Installation, understanding, manufacturing and use of more
              durable construction materials; Examination of the durability of the proposed
              advanced construction materials under severe environmental conditions using the
              unique environmental chamber installed at the Constructed Facilities Laboratory
              (CFL), North Carolina State University; Develop new construction materials for
              rehabilitation of steel structures using high strength and modulus composite
              materials; and Standardization and code approval of products and design
              control, education and transfer of technology to industry.
