Abstract    :
              The proposal is a request for funds to help support students and young
              scientists from U.S. institutions that otherwise could not afford to attend the
              2003 Particle Accelerator Conference (PAC'03). The conference will take place
              from May 12-16, 2003 in Portland, Oregon.  This conference is the 20th in the
              biennial series.  The conference will focus upon new developments in the
              science, technology and use of accelerators. Its purpose is to provide an
              opportunity for communication among accelerator scientists, engineers and
              others concerned with accelerator applications.
