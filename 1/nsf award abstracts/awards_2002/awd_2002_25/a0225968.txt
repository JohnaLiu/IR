The Internation Conference on Theoretical Physics
              (TH-2002) is being organized for July 22-27, 2002 in Paris, France. This award
              will help support the travel of young scientists, particularly graduate
              students and postdocs,to this conference.  A portion of the award will also
              support visits by young scientists to theoretical centers within Europe for the
              purpose of establishing new collaboration with scientists they might not
              otherwise encounter.
