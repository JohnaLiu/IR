Abstract    :
              This award supports an integrated research and education program that is
              centered on computing motion strategies in geometry-intensive applications.  A
              healthy synergy will be obtained by balancing efforts between both core issues
              and specialized applications.  The core of this research program is rooted in
              robot motion planning, and it is built on a broader unified mathematical
              framework that incorporates concepts from optimal control theory, computational
              geometry, statistical decision theory, and dynamic game theory.  This leads to
              the proposed investigation of three core algorithmic issues:  1) searching
              high-dimensional spaces that have algebraic and differential constraints,
              2)responding to unpredictable changes and on-line information, and 3) solving
              sensor-based tasks and processing incomplete information.  The focus is
              significantly broader than traditional path planning.  The core research is
              guided by efforts in several applications, such as mobile robotics with active
              sensing, virtual prototyping-hazardous environments.  These research efforts
              are incorporated into an education plan that:  1)builds an interdisciplinary
              group of graduate students who are carefully guided through the education and
              research process, ii) introduces undergraduates to research, particularly
              through mobile robotics and graphical simulation projects, iii) takes steps
              towards an interdisiplinary curriculum in geometric algorithms, and iv) helps
              those from disadvantaged backgrounds to realize their potential and excel in
              their careers.
