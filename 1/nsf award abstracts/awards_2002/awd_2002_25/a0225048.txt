Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for construction of a new multipurpose
              building at the Alice L. Kibbe field station located on the Mississippi River
              near the Illinois border with Iowa and Missouri.  The 4200 sq. ft. building
              will include dormitory accommodations for 48, and a combination dining hall and
              auditorium and associated kitchen.  The facility will be constructed with using
              insulated concrete forms, which provides a building with significantly
              increased energy efficiency over standard frame construction, and protection
              from tornados and strong storms, which the existing station facilities do not
              provide. 
The Kibbe station has an active undergraduate and graduate research
              program, a long tradition of summer field classes, and an increasing number of
              K-12 educational and service-oriented programs.  Ongoing research includes
              long-term studies on the population dynamics and diversity of freshwater
              mussels, turtles, fish, amphibians and fungi as well as, studies about the
              wintering ecology of bald eagles, and the influence of white-tailed deer
              browsing on herbaceous and woody diversity are in progress.  Undergraduate and
              graduate level classes in a variety of biological fields have been offered
              since 1966.
