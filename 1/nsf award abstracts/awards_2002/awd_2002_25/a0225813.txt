Abstract    :
              This award supports the travel and subsistence expenses of student participants
              in the First International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agents
              Systems (AAMAS), being held July 15 - 19, 2002 in Bologna, Italy. This
              conference is entirely devoted to all aspects of research and application of
              agents technology, an important area of research in the success of the World
              Wide Web, electronic commerce, digital libraries, search agents, personal
              agents and synthetic agents. Participation in this conference will allow a
              diverse group of students, representing a wide range of research areas and
              methodologies, to present their research to the agents' community. In addition,
              special mentoring activities are planned for them.
