Abstract    :
              Dr. Burch will use the bacteriophage phiX174 and its alternative hosts, E. coli
              and S. typhimurium, to investigate the impact of host limitation on the
              evolution of host range in this virus.  By manipulating host limitation, she
              will test the hypothesis that the benefits of host range expansion outweigh the
              costs when hosts are limited, and that the costs of host range expansion
              outweigh the benefits when hosts are abundant.  

The advantages of host
              range expansion for parasites include reduced competition for hosts, reduced
              time spent searching for hosts, and increased probability of transmission to a
              suitable host.  However, parasites are most often observed to specialize on a
              limited number of hosts.  This specialization may be explained by a variety of
              costs associated with broad host range, including a possible trade-off between
              fitness on one host and fitness on alternative hosts.  Experimental studies of
              host range have tended to concentrate on the potential costs of expanded host
              range rather than the potential benefits.  In contrast, Dr. Burch will study
              the evolution of host range by presenting the bacteriophage phiX174 with
              ecological conditions in which the benefits of expanded host range differ. 
              Studies of this nature may help identify ecological conditions that favor
              acquisition of new hosts, as in the recent movement of HIV into humans from
              chimpanzees.
