The goal of the proposed work is to combine high-resolution
              Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM)-based imaging that has been achieved for
              biological specimens with a novel approach to SPM-based nanomanipulation to
              yield a significant new approach for direct nanobiological investigations.  To
              achieve efficient and reliable manipulation in a micro/nano environment,
              capabilities of sensing, processing and actuation in dynamic interactions are
              essential.  Using the proposed approach, signals that would normally be
              projected as an SPM image are acquired and essential information is extracted
              for subsequent use as the sensing component within a feedback control loop
              formulation.  The control loop is used to accurately steer the probe's tip
              along a prescribed trajectory.  The feedback loop formulation involves landmark
              recognition and dynamic pattern matching through adaptive learning.  With this
              capability, the tip is able to return to and stay centered on a specific site
              by recognizing the way the site feels to the probe tip.  Except for high-level
              commands, the human operator can be eliminated from the operation and the full
              potential of this instrument with inherently sub-nanometer resolution can be
              utilized.
