              ABSTRACT

OCE-0225014
 

A major objective of the Gordon Conference in
              Chemical Oceanography is to bring together every one or two years leading
              members of the scientific community, along with post doctoral fellows and
              graduate students, to discuss new and exciting research in marine chemistry
              within an informal setting.  In 2002, the Gordon Conference in Chemical
              Oceanography will be held at the Queen's College in Oxford, United Kingdom to
              discuss research activities in the following areas:  (1) gases in the ocean;
              (2) Redfield ratios; (3) ocean carbon sequestration; (4) metal isotopes in
              ocean cycles; (5) trace metal uptake by marine biota; (6) marine calcification;
              (7) carbonate dissolution; (8) chemical transformations by bacteria; and (9)
              novel organic proxies.  The Gordon Conference has become recognized as an
              important venue to exchange ideas in the interdisciplinary field of marine
              chemistry and forge new scientific alliances.  Having the Gordon Conference in
              the United Kingdom will enable U.S. scientists to discover what new research
              activities are being carried out in Europe and facilitate international
              collaborations.  For this reason the National Science Foundation, along with
              the Gordon Research Conference, will co-sponsor the participation of 20
              graduate students and 33 invited speakers in the 2002 Gordon Conference in
              Chemical Oceanography.
