Abstract    :
              This award will support student travel and participation in a workshop focussing
              on climate science and science policy organized by the American Meteorological
              Society.  The workshop will be held from June 2-11, 2002 in Washington, D.C.
              and participants include seasoned researchers, new investigators, and students.
               The workshop participants will explore, among other issues, the nexus of
              communication between those who generate climate data and those who use such
              information for formulating science policy.  One area of focus for the workshop
              is examining the influence of paleoclimatic research in guiding our knowledge
              of climate variability and in formulating science policy.
