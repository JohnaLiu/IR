Abstract    :
              The proposal requests travel expenses for US researchers to participate in a
              DELOS workshop on methods and metrics for evaluating digital libraries from a
              number of perspectives.  The workshop will be held at MTA SZTAKI in Budapest,
              Hungary in June 2002.  The workshop is co-organized by US and EC funded
              researchers. The workshop is part of a larger, coordinated planning and
              research activity being carried out by NSF-EU working groups.  The findings of
              the working groups is expected to inform funding programs in the US, EU and
              other nations.

DELOS is a major forum for and organizer of digital libraries
              research and planning activities in Europe.  It is funded by Information
              Societies Technologies (IST) 5th Framework Programme of the European
