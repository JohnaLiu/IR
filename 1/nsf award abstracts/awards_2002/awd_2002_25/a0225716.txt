Abstract    :
              This award provides partial funding to support a summer school as an addition to
              the Eighteenth International Conference on Atomic Physics, ICAP2002, to be held
              in Cambridge, MA, July 28-August 3, 2002.   The purpose of the summer school is
              to serve the AMO community in two ways: 1) attraction and education of new
              workers into the AMO field, and 2) wider and more comprehensible dissemination
              of the results.
