Abstract    :
              Objective-Oriented Mobile Heterogeneous Sensor Networks for
Coordinated
              Control

This proposal focuses on a comprehensive study of large, mobile ad
              hoc
reconfigurable networks for coordinated control, using
              coordinated
autonomous flight as a guiding example problem. State
              estimation
provides a link between control and communications which
              admits
heterogeneous sensors, that is the combining of dissimilar
              or
different accuracy data using concepts which underpin data
fusion.
              Management of complexity and preservation of design principles
are keys to the
              development of workable, tunable, mission-oriented
systems with many
              components.

The intellectual merit of this collaborative research proposal
              hinges
on the drawing together of cognate and disparate elements
              from
coordinated control, dynamic state estimation, ad hoc
              network
management, resource assignment, and fault tolerance. Its aim is
              to
provide a formalism in which the methods of sensor networking may
              be
integrated as part of a systematic design process focused on achieving
a
              specific control objective. This provides a framework for the
development of
              methodologies for embedding a sensor network in a
context of control
              performance.

The broader impact of this research is that it ties together
              tools and
techniques from distinct areas using concepts of
              information
quality. The team is multi-disciplinary across a gamut of
              Systems
Engineering and the problem area impacts a range of
              fundamental
problems in the individual areas of specialization. This
              linkage
across communications, control, networking and estimation is
              a
perceived bottleneck of current design techniques.
