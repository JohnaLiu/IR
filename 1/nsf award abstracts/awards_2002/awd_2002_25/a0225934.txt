This award will supply shipboard
              scientific support equipment for the research vessel Walton Smith operated by
              the University of Miami, Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences
              and dedicated to use in support of marine research.  The Shipboard Scientific
              Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to
              the proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. The Program provides
              support for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the
              deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such
              as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the location
              of research sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers and
              satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and other
              equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from
              data retrieval sites.  The Project Director, David Powell is fully qualified to
              direct this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the
              acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.  This project will allow
              the institution to acquire EM conductor winch with block upgrades, hydro cable
              winch with block upgrades and winch control modification.  ***
