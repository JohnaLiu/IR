Abstract    :
              States and communities increasingly are recognizing that universities' roles in
              research, innovation, faculty entrepreneurship, and workforce preparedness
              provide the critical foundation for successful tech-based economic development.
               Paradoxically, the fiscal crises confronting all but four states is forcing
              difficult decisions regarding funding for higher education and tech-based
              economic development.  The State Science and Technology Institute (SSTI) sixth
              annual conference in Dearborn, MI will serve as a forum for nurturing stronger
              alliances between university and economic development officials during
              challenging financial times.

The university track will allow participants to
              examine and strengthen higher education's contributions toward forging local,
              state, and regional economic vitality.  The goals of this track are to (1)
              increase among technology-based economic development professionals recognition
              of and support for the important roles universities play in building
              technology-based economies; (2) attract more university leadership and research
              administrators to participate in the gathering, allowing the opportunity to
              foster stronger working relationships with their state, local and regional
              economic development partners; (3) provide a forum for universities to discuss
              shared challenges and issues in and examples of effective tools and techniques
              for increasing commercialization of university technology, building the
              research enterprise, encouraging faculty entrepreneurship, and preparing
              tomorrow's workers and leaders; and (5) promote interstate and intrastate
              cooperation toward common goals for research and economic
              development.
