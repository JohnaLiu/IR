Abstract    :
              In this two-year effort, we propose to address some of the basic research issues
              that arise in the interpretation of video streams, simultaneously collected by
              a set of indoor or outdoor cameras.
Specifically, we are interested in
              inferring movements and activities of one or more humans using
distributed
              cameras. We propose to develop novel methods for detecting and tracking humans
              using 3D models
for body parts, and quasi-invariant recognition of activities
              humans are engaged in. We will make use of the recent advances made in the
              computational aspects of estimating posterior probability density functions
              using
Monte Carlo Markov Chain techniques to infer human descriptions and
              their activities.
