Title: SGER: 	"Suction Pile Retrieval"

ABSTRACT

	An
              Innovative underwater foundation system utilizing suction piles
was introduced
              in the offshore industry recently.  Since then, suction piles
have been
              successfully used in numerous occasions on a variety of offshore
structures. 
              Suction piles have advantages over conventional underwater
foundation systems
              due to their simplicity and efficiency.  More obvious
advantages of suction
              piles are easy installation, large bearing capacity,
and retrievability. 
              

	The retrieval of suction piles is achieved through careful
application of
              increased water pressure inside the pile.  The applied water
pressure must be
              determined carefully so that the suction pile can be
retrieved safely.  The
              main objective of this study is to identify the relationship
between the
              applied positive water pressure inside the pile and the
resulting pile
              pull-out movement through full-scale field tests.  These
experiments will
              provide an invaluable insight for the future development of
an analytical
              solution for safe suction pile retrieval.  

	The field retrieval and
              instrumentation will be designed and
supervised by the principal investigator
              and performed by the Naval
Facilities Engineering Service Center with three
              suction piles that were
successfully installed by the principal investigator
              in 1999.  Significant
matching contribution commitment has already been made
              by the Naval
Facilities Engineering Service Center as evidence of their
              interests and
emphasis on the expanded use of suction piles.
