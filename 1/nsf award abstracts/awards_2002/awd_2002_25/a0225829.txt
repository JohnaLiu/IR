Abstract    :
              The project is extending work on isotopic fractionation of nitrous oxide and
              carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for the purpose of elucidating the budgets and
              the processes that contribute to the sources and sinks of these greenhouse
              gases.  A combination of two- and three-dimensional models are being applied to
              relate the observed atmospheric isotopic fractionations to various biospheric
              processes that will help constrain the values of their sources and sinks.  This
              work is contributing to the understanding of two atmospheric trace gases that
              are likely to play a major role in future climate change.
