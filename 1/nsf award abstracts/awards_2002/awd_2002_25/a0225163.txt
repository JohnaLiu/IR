Abstract    :
              The Center for the Study of Wireless Electromagnetic Compatibility was
              established in the College of Engineering at the University of Oklahoma in
              1994.  Its purpose is to link with the various industries affected by wireless
              technology and bring them together to develop common solutions.  This is
              essential for the health growth of these industries.  It is expected that the
              growth of the cellular phone industry will continue to accelerate and exceed
              that of the personal computer industry in the 1980's.  The research focus of
              the Center has been carefully developed to support the needs of the wireless
              industry as defined through an original pilot study, the Charter of the Center,
              and the continual input from the Center's Industry Advisory Board.  The
              Center's research focus encompasses the following:  Electromagnetic
              compatibility between products in the wireless industry and the following
              electronics industries; Medical; Automotive; and Aviation.  Research leading to
              the identification and resolution of interaction mechanisms between the
              radiating devices in the wireless industry and other electronic devices. 
              Research concerning the development and growth of wireless technology as well
              as future bands of transmission.
