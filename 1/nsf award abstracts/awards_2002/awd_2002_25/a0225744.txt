Abstract    :
              This project proposes to continue the efforts of the Student Meeting Activities
              Subcommittee of the Power Engineering Education Committee (PEEC) of the IEEE
              Power Engineering Society (PES) to promote student interest and participation
              in the power engineering field by sponsoring 90-100 electrical engineering
              students to attend the IEEE-PES annual Summer Meeting to be held in Chicago,
              Illinois July 21-25, 2002. The goal of this project is to provide an
              opportunity for students to be exposed to the most recent developments in
              design, operation, construction, and research in the power engineering field,
              to share ideas amongst themselves, and to interact with practicing engineers.
              This is a particularly critical time for power engineering as the industry
              undergoes significant change due to the restructuring of the traditional
              utility structure. It is crucial to recruit the nation's best and brightest
              engineering students into this evolving field. The career opportunities for
              students interested in power engineering are many and varied; opportunities
              exist within utilities, vendors, manufacturers, and consulting firms.
