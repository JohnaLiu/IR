Abstract    :
              We shall organize a Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences conference on
              `Expansion Methods in Combinatorics' to take place in Memphis in May 2003. The
              principal lecturer will be Christian Borgs of Microsoft Research and the
              conference will be aimed at young researchers as well as established
              researchers in combinatorics, computer science and other areas related to
              statistical physics and probability theory.

Although several methods from
              statistical physics have already found applications in combinatorics and
              theoretical computer science, one of the classical methods of statistical
              mechanics, cluster expansion, has
hardly been employed in these fields. There
              is every reason to believe that in the right hands these expansion techniques
              will find important and far-reaching applications in combinatorics and
              theoretical computer science. For this reason, the conference will address
              these important techniques with the twin aims of raising awareness of them and
              working towards their simplification.
