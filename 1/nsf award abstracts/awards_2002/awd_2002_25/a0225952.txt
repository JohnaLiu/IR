Abstract    :
              DMI-9734147  Endres  The research focus of this CAREER project is integrated
              analysis of the machine tool, tooling, and machining process in support of a
              systems-approach to the development, planning and diagnosis of machining
              systems.  This requires a comprehensive analysis tool that merges detailed
              cutting mechanics and analytical machining dynamics, which represents a shift
              in paradigm from looking at the two as virtually separate problems.  A 3-D
              mechanistic edge ploughing model will be formulated such that it adheres to
              slip-line theory.  The ploughing model will be complemented by a model of the
              cut-chip deformation energy that is present when using curved cutting edges
              seen in industrially relevant processes.  The result is the replacement of
              process-specific physical calibration experiments with predicted
              process-specific calibration pseudo-based solely on tube-end turning physical
              test data.  It will then be merged with an analytical solution for chatter
              level, derived first for a linear process and then extended to account for
              process nonlinearity. Educational activities will include the redevelopment of
              a mechanical design course into a project-based experience including design,
              analysis and hands-on manufacture of components and simple systems, as well as
              the development of a graduate course on dynamics and mechanics of machining as
              a repository for the latest research in machining dynamics and fundamental
              process mechanics.  The development of analytical dynamics solutions for
              performance and risk assessment increases the pool of analysis tools and allows
              industrial users to reduce calibration testing.  The resulting advances in the
              science base will make possible economic implementation of emerging machining
              practices (high-speed, single-pass and hard machining).
