Abstract    :
              The proposal is a request for partial support for a two-day conference to
              recognize the scientific achievements of P.A.M. Dirac.  The conference will
              take place in Tallahassee on December 6-7, 2002.  There will be lectures on
              various frontier topics in physics research, many of which were strongly
              influenced by Dirac's work.  The conference will be of great educational value
              to young scientists and the proceedings will be published by World Scientific. 
              The funds will be used to cover the costs of registration and travel for
              attending students working in experimental or theoretical particle physics.
