This is a request for travel funds for a Workshop titled
              "Advanced hybrid systems theory
for the control of networked systems" to be
              held in conjunction with the 2002 World
Congress of the International
              Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) in Barcelona, Spain
on July 21, 2002.
              The requested funds will be instrumental in enabling participation in
the
              workshop of internationally recognized US experts in the area of hybrid
              control
systems and control networks, as well as of young researchers,
              interested in this
increasingly important area.

This workshop is
              co-sponsored by the European Commission, IST Programme, Brussels, Belgium (Dr.
              Alkis Konstantellos), which will partially cover the travel expenses of the
              European participants and also cover the expenses for the meeting facilities.
              The Organizers/Moderators of this workshop are Dr. Panos Antsaklis from the
              University of Notre Dame, Indiana and Dr. Manfred Morari from ETH, Zurich,
              Switzerland. 
Dr. Antsaklis is organizing the participation of US researchers
              and Dr. Morari is organizing the EU participation.
