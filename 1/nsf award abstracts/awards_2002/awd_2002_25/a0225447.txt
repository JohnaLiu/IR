Abstract    :
              Urban transportation systems face important challenges concerning safety, delays
              due to congestion, pollution from vehicle emissions, and vulnerability to
              natural and man-made disasters.  Sophisticated, integrated sensor/actuator
              systems offer the potential to make significant inroads in alleviating these
              problems.  Vehicle-to-vehicle communication via ad hoc wireless networks
              present new opportunities for innovative applications with reduced public
              infrastructure investments.  This project will explore the realization of
              simulation-based test beds for rapid evaluation and integration of sensor and
              actuator systems in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), and use this test
              bed to explore architectural alternatives for data networks supporting ITS
              applications.  An integrated distributed simulation approach will be utilized,
              focusing on interoperable simulations of transportation infrastructures, wired
              and wireless communication networks, and distributed computing applications. 
              The project will incorporate data from a pool of instrumented vehicles
              operating in the Atlanta metropolitan area providing second-by-second sensor
              data concerning the vehicle's location, velocity, and acceleration, among
              others; data from road sensors in the Atlanta area will also be used for model
              and scenario development and validation of simulations.  Test bed research will
              focus on developing a modular, federated simulation/emulation approach using a
              software backplane to interface simulations and data.
