Abstract    :
              This project will use four-dimensional data assimilation to dynamically specify
              the condition of the Earth's electron radiation belts from very near the
              Earth's surface out to a distance of 10 Earth radii.  It will utilize data from
              the Los Alamos geostationary satellites, the NOAA GOES satellites and the GPS
              satellites.  Additional data will come from the SAMPEX and Polar satellites. 
              Two empirical prediction techniques will be used.  The first is an
              Auto-Regressive Moving Average model based on linear system identification
              theory.  The second is a model based on the concept of historical analogs.  The
              two techniques will be compared with one another in order to determine under
              what conditions each technique is most appropriate.
