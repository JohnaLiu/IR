Abstract    :
              Several computationally di .cult optimization problems have a natural underlying
              discrete struc-
ture:e.g.,design/routing problems in networking have
              appropriate graph-theoretic formulations.
Discrete/combinatorial optimization
              is the study of how such combinatorial underpinnings can help
us understand
              better and solve optimization problems.
This project aims to develop improved
              algorithms for speci .c important problems in this .eld,
and to develop
              general algorithmic paradigms for combinatorial optimization;one of the main
              gen-
eral approaches will be probabilistic The powerful role played by
              randomness in the computational
context has been among the major discoveries
              in the foundations of computer science.This project
proposes to develop
              improved randomized algorithms for a family of hard combinatorial
              optimiza-
tion problems,and to develop new probabilistic tools of independent
              nterest in the process.It also
aims to conduct re .ned probabilistic
              (i.e.,average-case instead of worst-case)analyses of some of
these problems
              where relevant.Two sub-themes of the proposed research are to study hard
              opti-
mization problems that arise in the .eld of networking,and to approach
              di .cult problems through
approximation algorithms where appropriate.
The
              goal of this project is to study improved algorithmic approaches for
              fundamental problems
(such as various design,routing,and scheduling problems
              in networks)as well as to develop improved
probabilistic/algorithmic paradigms
              in general.This endeavor will help develop new principles for
the
              design,analysis,and engineering of randomized/approximation algorithms in
              networking and
combinatorial optimization.
