Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this program is to gain a better understanding of how
              aerosol particles impact climate and climate change by examining the chemical,
              physical, and optical properties of the major aerosol species over the tropical
              and subtropical North Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean to understand the processes
              that cause any significant temporal or spatial variations in those properties. 
              Continuous measurements of aerosol properties will be made at three ground
              stations: Izana, Tenerife, Canary Islands; Ragged Point, Barbados; and Miami,
              Florida.  These measurements will become part of a long-term database that
              began in 1965 with the establishment of an atmospheric sampling site at Ragged
              Point, Barbados and continued through the Atmosphere/Ocean Chemistry Experiment
              (AEROCE).

The tropical North Atlantic and Caribbean are particularly
              important and interesting because tropical oceans are thought to have a
              significant impact on weather and climate, and because these ocean regions
              underlay an atmosphere more impacted by airborne particles, especially mineral
              dust, than any other.  During summer months, pollutants from North Africa and
              southern Europe are transported with mineral dust.  During the winter, less
              frequent episodic transport of mineral dust from more southern regions in
              Africa are carried through the atmosphere often with biomass burning products.
