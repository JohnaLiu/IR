Abstract    :
              
Cyberlogic is a semantic foundation for implementing evidential
transactions
              using the public key infrastructure (PKI).  Evidential
transactions form the
              basis of frameworks for authorization and
authentication, electronic commerce,
              business workflow, and digital
government.  Such transactions involve the
              exchange of physical evidence
in the form of identity cards, driver's
              licenses, money, checks, visas,
airline tickets, traffic tickets, birth
              certificates, and stock
certificates, as well as electronic evidence including
              PIN numbers,
passwords, keys, certificates, and nonces.  Cyberlogic is an
              enabling
foundation for building and analyzing protocols that involve
              the
exchange of electronic forms of evidence.

Cyberlogic builds on
              evidence, public keys, and protocols.  First, evidence
is encoded by means of
              numbers using digital certificates and nonces.
Second, public keys are
              predicates so that any information $i$ signed by a
private key corresponding
              to the public key $P$ entails that $P$ holds of
$i$.  Indeed, the signed
              certificate is a proof for the assertion contained
in the certificate.  Third,
              protocols are distributed logic programs that
gather evidence by using both
              ordinary predicates and digital
certificates.   These simple building blocks
              can be used to
construct a rich variety of services in a variety of
              domains
ranging from digital government to access control in computer
              systems.

The public key infrastructure (PKI) provides basic services
              for
encryption, authentication, trust, authorization, and
              digital
certificates.  Cyberlogic is a protocol layer over the PKI that serves
              as
a reliable foundation for evidential transactions.  It provides
              a
standardized semantic and computational infrastructure for
              exchanging
evidence in electronic form.  With such a foundation, it is
              possible to
design secure electronic versions of transactions that currently
              require
physical forms of evidence.
