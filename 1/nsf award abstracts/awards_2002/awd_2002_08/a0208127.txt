Hydrogen is arguably the most important minor element in
              the solid earth:  It dominates the melting behavior and rheology of mantle
              rocks; it is the principle solvent for metasomatic transport in the crust and
              mantle; its concentration in silicate minerals controls rates of diffusion of
              other elements; and its abundance in silicate melts strongly influences
              crystallization-differentiation.  However, the geochemistry of hydrogen is less
              well described than that for virtually any other element (and certainly any of
              similar importance):  Reasonable estimates of the total abundance of H in the
              earth span a range of nearly an order of magnitude; concentrations, residence
              times, and sources and sinks of hydrogen in major mantle reservoirs are poorly
              known or only guessed at; and partitioning of hydrogen between minerals and
              melts has yet to be described with the same experimental sophistication given
              to studies of other minor elements.
We believe that our understanding of the
              global hydrogen cycle can be advanced by studying the hydrogen isotope
              composition (i.e., D/H ratio) of well characterized suites of submarine basalts
              whose origin and evolution is influenced by mantle hydrogen.  The potential for
              such studies has been recognized for many years, but has not been realized due
              to sparse data, the large proportion of isotopic measurements on samples that
              are not characterized for other important geochemical parameters, and lack of
              inter-laboratory standardization.  We propose to characterize the variation in
              D/H ratio among submarine basalts associated with the Mariana arc and its back
              arc basin, which are a key set of samples for our current understanding of the
              role of water in magma genesis at convergent margins.  We will approach this
              study using a new analytical method for determining D/H ratios and H contents
              of small quantities (10's to hundreds of micrograms) of hydrous solids and
              glasses at a rate approximately 10x that of conventional analyses but with
              similar accuracy and precision.  This method will let us produce relatively
              large, well standardized and well replicated data sets in a reasonable time
              frame.
