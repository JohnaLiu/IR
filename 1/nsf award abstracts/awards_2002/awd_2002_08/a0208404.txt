Abstract    :
              Microorganisms play a critical role in plant health.  Depending on the organism,
              microbes can cause disease or prevent it.  Despite their importance to our
              agricultural base and food security, we know little about them on a genomic
              level.  To enable the scientific community to intervene in disease and to
              understand the basis of biocontrol, a concerted and well-coordinated genomic
              analysis of these microbes is essential.  Members of the American
              Phytopathological Society (APS) have developed a prioritized list of
              plant-associated microbes for genome analysis, i.e. the structural and
              functional analysis of the microbial genes and the proteins encoded by those
              genes, with ultimate emphasis on those genes and proteins involved in plant
              associations. The APS prioritized list will serve as a foundation for a
              workshop with the goal of developing a strategy to obtain the genomic
              information needed to understand these important microbes and their
              interactions with host plants and the environment. The Workshop on Genomic
              Analysis of Plant-Associated Microorganisms will be held in Washington, D.C,
              April 9-11, 2002.  This award will help defray the travel expenses of about 20
              experts from the genomics and microbial research communities.  These experts
              will be challenged to (1) detail and prioritize the scientific and technical
              needs and (2) develop a plan for a coordinated and collaborative effort for
              genomic analysis of these plant-associated microbes.  The results of this
              workshop will be disseminated to the wider APS membership via an emailed "News
              Capsule" and published in Phytopathology News.  Additionally, a follow-up forum
              sponsored by the APS Policy Board will be held at the Society's 2002 Annual
              Meeting held in August to inform members and generate wider discussion about
              the issues.
