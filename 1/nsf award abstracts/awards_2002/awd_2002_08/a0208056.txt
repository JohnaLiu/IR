Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Influence of Nutritional Cues on
              Reproduction in Nomadic Songbirds."  The objectives of this project are to
              investigate the influence of nutritional cues on the neuroendocrine regulation
              of reproductive development in two closely related nomadic songbirds (pine
              siskin  and lesser goldfinch) that depend heavily upon foods that vary widely
              in availability between years and across broad geographic ranges.
