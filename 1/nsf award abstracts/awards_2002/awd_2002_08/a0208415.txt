The proposed study is about
              collaboration and joint research in the area of particle physics, between the
              Korea Detector laboratory (KODEL) in Seoul, Korea and Iowa State University in
              Ames, Iowa. The scientific goal of the collaboration is the understanding of
              the origin of mass. This fundamental property of matter is postulated to come
              about because all particles interact with a field, called the Higgs field,
              which permeates the universe.
