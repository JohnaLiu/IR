Abstract    :
              Continuous observations using Global Positioning System (GPS) geodesy yield
              high-precision determination of horizontal and vertical deformation rates and
              their variation in time and space.  This project focuses on two aspects of the
              current GPS-determined four-dimensional deformation field along the Cascadia
              convergent margin in the Pacific Northwest.  First, the spatial and temporal
              distribution of transient events on the Cascadia megathrust is being
              investigated. This part of the study is motivated by preliminary results that
              indicate at least 8 silent earthquakes (aseismic slip events lasting days to
              months) with Mw > 6.0 (equivalent) occurred in the Pacific Northwest since 1992
              based on analysis of the PANGA network. The data are being reanalyzed using
              principal component analysis the results of which are used for spatial
              inversion to determine the moment yield, spatial locations, and migration of
              each creep event across the plate interface. Second, the kinematics of the
              migrating continental fore-arc (western Washington) as it encounters a rigid
              buttress (Vancouver Island) are being examined by analysis of the velocity
              field from the PANGA array, and development of fault geometry  and mechanical
              block models of the intraplate deformation of the Cascadia margin and Puget
              Lowlands.
