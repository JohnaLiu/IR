Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this project is to determine the characteristics of the
              response of the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) to geomagnetic storms.
               The study will utilize the extensive ground-based, dual-frequency, Global
              Positioning System (GPS) measurements of TEC.  A recent study has shown that by
              sorting F-region ionosonde data (NmF2) as a function of a new index of storm
              magnitude, a consistent repeatable picture begins to emerge in each season and
              latitude.  The PIs will perform a similar analysis of total electron content,
              and compare and contrast the geophysical response with NmF2.  This study will
              contribute to the understanding of the ionospheric response to geomagnetic
              storms.  In the context of the National Space Weather Program, the work will
              provide the information to hopefully lead to an operational product for the
              benefit of a range of single frequency GPS users.
