Abstract    :
              This research investigates a new architecture designed to provide
data to
              wireless users using a broadcast technique. The objective of this research is
              to develop schemes for implementing the concept ``DAta in your space (DAYS)"
              which combines broadcasting (push) and traditional querying (pull) techniques
              into one global wireless approach. In this scheme the data broadcasters
              (special servers) will continuously
broadcast (push) requested data to a set
              of ``dedicated" wireless
channels, which will be captured by clients (users of
              the data) at
any time and at any place.  The space will thus be used
              as
persistent storage for all mobile as well as static devices. 

A
              universal wireless broadcast approach requires that mobile users be able to
              find and use the right broadcast information.   Some of the questions to mbe
              addressed include:
1.  How can the mobile user know which channel has the
              correct data?
2.  How is data to be assigned to channels?
3.  What techniques
              can be used to effectively determine the best contents of each channel given
              many mobile users?
4.  Without explicit user queries, how can the mobile user
              be assured that the needed data is being broadcast?
5. How can the mobile user
              be assured that the needed data moves with
  him?
These issues have to be
              examined on a global scale.
