Abstract    :
              This joint award made to University of North Carolina Chapel Hill by the
              Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry (MPS) and the Kinetics,
              Catalysis and Molecular program in the Division of Chemical Transport System
              (ENG) is to design and synthesize porous chiral crystalline and non-crystalline
              zeolitic materials based on polymer-metal coordination networks.  With this
              award, Professor Lin will prepare a variety of enantiopure rigid and bridging
              ligands with different functional groups and topologies from readily available
              2,2'-dihydroxy-1,1'-binaphthalene. These chiral porous materials will have
              tailorable nanometer-sized chiral pockets and functionalities that can be
              exploited for potential applications in enantioselective separations and
              catalysis.  These materials will have both the advantages offered by
              heterogeneous catalysts (including facile catalyst separation and recovery,
              high stability, and ease of handling), and those offered by their homogeneous
              counterparts (including homogeneity of active sites, high efficiency,
              reproducibility, selectivity, and controllability, and mild reaction
              conditions). In addition, training in materials chemistry will be provided to a
              diversity of students with this award. 

With this award, porous and
              non-crystalline zeolite like materials with tailorable nanometer-sized chiral
              pockets and functionalities will be synthesized from readily available
              chemicals, and these materials are expected to have applications in
              enantioselective separations and catalysis for the synthesis of chiral drugs
              and fine chemicals.  In addition, these catalysts will have the advantages of
              both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts.
