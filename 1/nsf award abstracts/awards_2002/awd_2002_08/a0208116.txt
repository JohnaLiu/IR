Abstract    :
              This project includes the research activities to obtain the stability and
              scalability of the inter-domain routing protocols. The proposed research will
              not only address issues on the current interdomain routing protocol, Border
              Gateway Protocol (BGP), but also develop new interdomain routing protocols that
              can facilitate fast convergence and ensure reliability. In enhancing
              interdomain routing, robust configuration and traffic engineering capability
              are the integral part of the research. This includes fundamental understanding
              of BGP capability and investigating the minimum set of extensions to the
              current BGP. Robust configuration capability also requires high-level
              specification of the network configuration goal. The research team will perform
              systematic studies of fundamental issues on interdomain routing, including
              tradeoffs between traffic engineering capability and scalability of interdomain
              routing, routing policy guidelines to avoid persistent oscillation and the
              tradeoff between these guidelines and traffic engineering capability, reducing
              routing protocol convergence delay, and enhancing routing reliability by
              specifying high-level routing policy semantics. One component of this project
              is to educate graduate and undergraduate students on the management and
              configuration of the networks as well as to create awareness and interest among
              students on the issues surrounding interdomain routing.
