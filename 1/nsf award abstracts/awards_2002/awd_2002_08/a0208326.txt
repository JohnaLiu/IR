Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Electron microscopy study of the
              structure of ATP Binding Cassette transporter protein MsbA."   ATP Binding
              Cassette (ABC) transporter proteins couple ATP hydrolysis with translocation of
              various substrate molecules across biological membranes.  This study is
              investigating the model that posits that large conformational changes in the
              transporter protein allows the substrate to move across the membrane.  
              Electron microscopy and helical image analysis are being used to determine the
              structure and mechanism of the MsbA transporter.
