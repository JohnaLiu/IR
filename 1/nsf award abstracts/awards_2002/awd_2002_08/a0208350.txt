Abstract    :
              This project will develop ad space weather analysis model for use in the
              preparation of space weather maps and space weather forecasting.  The analysis
              model will be driven by data from spacecraft in geosynchronous,
              geosynchronous-transfer and polar low-Earth (LEO) orbits.  Three components of
              space weather will be included in the analysis model: (1) the magnetic field,
              (2) fluxes of radiation-belt (high energy) particles, and (3) fluxes of keV
              electrons.  For each of these components, the analysis model will include four
              elements: (a) an empirical model, (b) observational data, (c) the model
              error-covariance matrix, and (d) a physics based model checker/corrector.  The
              checker/corrector component will ensure that the model is consistent with
              physical laws.
