Romero-Severson

Dr. Romero-Severson and colleagues propose the
              construction of BAC libraries for five insect taxa (Tribolium castaneum,
              Nassonia vitripennis, Oncopeltus fasciatus, Thermobia domestica and
              Schistocerca Americana) selected for their phylogenetic position, scientific
              importance and scarcity of existing genomic resources.  These taxa represent
              the insect orders Coleoptera (beetles), Hymenoptera (wasps and bees), Hemiptera
              (true bugs),  Thysanura (silverfish) and Orthoptera (grasshoppers and
              crickets).
In combination with the whole genome sequences of the Dipteran
              insects Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae, these libraries will
              enable the scientific community to test important hypotheses concerning insect
              genetics, genomics, development, ecology, systematics, and evolution. This
              effort will dovetail with the ongoing development of an insect genomics
              database at Purdue University. 

The Clemson University Genomics Institute
              (CUGI) is the subcontractor for the BAC library construction. Over the past
              five years, the CUGI BAC/EST Resource Center has constructed most of the plant
              and fungal BAC libraries used in agricultural genomics. The CUGI BAC/EST
              Resource Center will supply the insect libraries as high-density hybridization
              filters and clones on a cost recovery basis for academic programs.
