A workshop of the APEC (Asia Pacific Economic
              Cooperation) Cooperation for Earthquake Simulation(ACES) group in is being held
              in May 2002. The purpose of the workshop is to review recent progress in
              several key areas of science and technology related to  earthquake simulations
              and to formulate goint plans for future progress. Issues being addressed by
              conferees include data storage, retrieval, assimilation, visualization, and
              manipulation, integrated with capabilities to instantiate knowledge acquisition
              and reasoning via models and simulations of nonlinear multi-scale dynamical
              earthquake processes. A  peer-reviewed proceedings volume and a peer-reviewed
              special issue of a journal are being published.
