The long-term focus of our research is to develop and exploit
              the tools of genomics to make the Oryza genus the most advanced and tractable
              model system to study plant evolution, development, physiology and crop science
              in the world. The specific objectives of this proposal are to construct and
              distribute eleven high quality deepcoverage large insert BAC libraries for the
              ten genomes of Oryza (Table 1). With the
complete sequence of the A genome of
              rice on the horizon, having convenient public access to the other nine genomes
              of rice in the form of BAC libraries, will permit rapid advances in both basic
              and applied research for the most important food crop in the world.
