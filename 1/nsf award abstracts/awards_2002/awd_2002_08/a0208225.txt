The integrated hydrologic, hydraulic and hydrometeorological
              process that controls flooding in urbanizing drainage basins will be examined
              through analyses of flood response in the Baltimore metropolitan region.  The
              science questions are:  (1) How does the scale-dependent flood response of
              urban drainage basins depend on the space-time structure of rainfall for warm
              season systems of thunderstorms?  (2) How does flood response vary with
              land-surface properties including impervious cover and structure of the urban
              drainage network?  And (3) What is the relative role of changing
              channel/floodplain morphology due to urbanization, as compared with geologic
              controls of channel floodplain morphology, in determining the attenuation of
              flood waves?  Questions 1 and 2 will be examined through hydrologic and
              hydrometeorological analyses of flood events in 24 drainage basins smaller than
              200 km2 for 25-30 flood events during the period 1996-2003.  Diagnostic
              analyses of rainfall and discharge observations for the flood events will be
              used in conjunction with model analyses to address questions 1 and 2. 
              Hydrologic model analyses will be based on a distributed hydrologic model, the
              Network Model.  Hydraulic analyses of  flood wave propagation will be carried
              out for a subset of the 24 basins and will include 4 stream reaches, each with
              upstream-downstream pairs of stream gaging stations.  The 2-d depth-averaged
              hydraulic model, TELEMAC, will be used for assessing hydraulic controls of
              flood response in urbanizing stream channels.  The key observations used in
              this study are:  (1) high-resolution (1 km, 5 minutes) radar rainfall
              estimates, (2) high-resolution (0.6 m contour interval) topographic data sets,
              (3) high-resolution (0.6 m grid, 0.15 m vertical resolution) topographic data
              sets derived from airborne radar, (4) high-resolution (1 m) representations of
              impervious cover, and (5) field-surveyed channel cross sections, longitudinal
              profiles and pebble counts.
