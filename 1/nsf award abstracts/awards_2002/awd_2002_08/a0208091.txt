Abstract    :
              

With National Science Foundation support, Xavier University of Louisiana
              will implement institutional self-assessments and develop an action plan to
              strengthen the institution's undergraduate science, technology, engineering and
              mathematics (STEM) instructional and research infrastructure.  The objective of
              the proposed effort is to better prepare STEM graduates for entry, successful
              careers and leadership positions in the STEM workforce.

Project activities
              include (1) evaluation and improvement of student recruitment strategies with
              the goal of increasing enrollment in SMET programs; (2) identification of
              current impediments to successful completion of STEM gate-keeping courses and
              development of strategies to increase completion, retention and graduation; (3)
              evaluation of STEM curricula to discover methods to better prepare students for
              success in the STEM workforce; and, (4) development of strategies to integrate
              research and education.
