Abstract    :
              This project will utilize magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the
              magnetosphere-ionosphere system to examine the sensitivity of MHD simulations
              to variability of the solar wind driver.  The work will compare the variability
              induced by intrinsic, internal magnetospheric dynamics with the variability
              caused by both temporal and spatial variability in the solar wind.  Case
              studies will be done with real events to allow for comparisons of the
              simulations with realistic conditions.  This work will provide a mechanism for
              determining the accuracy with which MHD models might in the future be able to
              predict space weather conditions.
