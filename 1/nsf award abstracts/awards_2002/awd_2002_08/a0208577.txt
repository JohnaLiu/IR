Abstract    :
              Computational information theory is concerned with techniques (such as
channel
              coding) for achieving channel capacities.  The field has
achieved dramatic
              scientific breakthroughs in recent years, and codes
that come close to
              theoretical limits have been discovered.  Today,
the development of coding and
              information theory is closely related to
the explosion of information
              technology, with applications to the
Internet and the next generation of
              networks technologies.  The rapid
development of a myriad of networked devices
              for computing and
telecommunications presents new and exciting challenges for
              coding and
information theory. 

This project will explore interconnections
              among coding theory,
theoretical computer science, information theory, and
              related areas of
computer science and mathematics in order to deal with
              research
challenges arising from optical/magnetic recording and
              optical
transmission, the interface between information theory and
              symbolic
dynamics, the development of network information theory, advances
              in
high speed data transmission in wired channels, the connection
              between
coding theory and related mathematical approaches (especially
              using
discrete mathematics), the role of compression in all layers of
              data
networks, and exploiting the connections between algorithmic
complexity
              and notions of entropy and randomness.

Research efforts will be carried out
              by ``working groups'' that will
come together at DIMACS for several meetings
              aimed at catalyzing
communications and collaborations. Subgroups will
              investigate problems
of interest. The working groups will be concerned with
              Data
Compression in Networks and Applications and with
              Optical/Magnetic
Recording and Optical Transmission.

The project will
              integrate research and education through a series of
workshops aimed at
              identifying areas for research, involving large
groups of researchers in the
              field of computational information theory
and coding, and introducing many
              people (including outstanding junior
people and students) to the field. 
              Workshops are
planned on the topics of High Speed Data Transmission in
              Wired
Channels, Network Information Theory, Complexity and
              Inference,
Information Theory and Symbolic Dynamics, and Coding Theory
              and
Discrete Mathematics.
