Abstract    :
              This project investigates the role of information encoding techniques for
              reducing energy consumed by various processor components including the fetch
              mechanism, on-chip instruction and data caches, functional units, instruction
              issue logic, and CPU I/O pins. To address energy consumption by all of the
              above processor components, three distinct types of encodings will be
              investigated in this project. Data encoding will be used to reduce the activity
              in data caches where the data resides and external data bus I/O pins over which
              data is transmitted. Instruction encodings in form of 32 bit ARM ISA and 16 bit
              Thumb ISA available in the XScale processor will be used to generate compact
              code which gives high performance. Finally, compiler or profiler generated
              hints will be encoded into the generated code to throttle the energy
              consumption of a processor.
