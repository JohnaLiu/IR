Abstract    :
              This project investigates gestural communication in collaborative physical
              tasks, tasks in which two or more individuals work together to perform actions
              on concrete objects in the three-dimensional world. For example, an expert
              might guide a worker's performance of emergency repairs to an aircraft,
              students might collaborate to build a science project, or a medical team might
              work together to save a patient's life.  Observations of physical
              collaborations in face-to-face settings have suggested that gesture plays an
              important role in communication and task performance.  To date, however, video
              systems for remote collaboration on physical tasks have rarely incorporated
              technologies to support gesture. The project has three aims: (a) to increase
              our understanding of the types and functions of gestures in collaborative
              physical tasks in face-to-face settings; (b) to systematically evaluate the
              impact of alternative methods for implementing gesture in systems for remote
              collaboration on physical tasks; and (c) to develop and test prototype gesture
              systems.   A closely inter-related series of laboratory experiments, field
              studies, and technology development efforts will be used to meet these aims. 
              Taken together, these research activities will improve the design of systems
              for remote collaboration in medical, educational, vehicular repair, and other
              physical domains.
