"Performance Based Soft Real-time Scheduling in
              Networked Control Systems"

This project is developing novel methods for the
              design of high performance networked control systems. The networked control
              system under consideration distributes controller functionality over a
              collection of micro-controllers that communicate over an ad-hoc communication
              network. The project uses a soft variation of the (m,k)-firm guarantee model to
              characterize task scheduling in networked control systems. The project consists
              of three tasks. The first task obtains upper bounds on dropout probabilities
              that assure robust performance of the closed loop system. These bounds define
              the soft (m,k)-model, which is one major emphasis of the research. The second
              emphasis is on the design of implementable schedulers that enforce the soft
              (m,k) model arising from the control design.

The project's broader impact is
              achieved through the inclusion of methods and concepts developed in this
              project in undergraduate courses that introduce embedded system principles.
