Abstract    :
              This project will create a sharable scientific infrastructure for experimental
              research on large-scale, large-grain multi-agent software systems (MAS). The
              research will extend the capabilities of an existing lightweight, flexible,
              integrative, and scalable experimental platform called MACE3J. Building on the
              current prototype, additional functionality will be designed into MACE3J, and
              several modeling/analysis component libraries will be  added.  The resulting
              infrastructure will be tested for robustness and scalability on
              small-to-large-scale multicomputer platforms using a suite of example MAS
              problems. The tools and documentation produced by the research will be widely
              distributed as a community research base.  Outcomes will include: 1) a facility
              for collaboration and model/data integration within the MAS research community;
              2) a technology that will begin unifying MAS community efforts with ongoing
              high-performance computing research in areas such as single-system-image
              clustering, very large, distributed computational grids, highly heterogeneous
              high-performance codes, and the use of Java for high-performance computing; 3)
              tools for education and demonstration of multi-agent systems research and
              results; and 4) foundations for common benchmark problems, to provide
              comparability of results and to help measure general progress in the field of 
              MAS.
