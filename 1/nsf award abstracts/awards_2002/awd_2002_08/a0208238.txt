Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Control of a feeding neural
              circuit in an inscet by taste sensory input and hunger status."  Manduca sexta
              larvae become host-specific when they feed on solanaceous plants due to changes
              in taste receptor responses to a host-specific recognition cue. Host-specific
              larvae often starve to death if given food lacking this cue.
              Electrophysiological studies are being conducted to examine the integration of
              taste receptor physiology and hunger on the feeding circuitry of host-specific
              and non-specific larvae.
