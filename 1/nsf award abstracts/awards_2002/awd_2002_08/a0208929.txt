Abstract    :
              Given a metric space, that is a finite set of points with
distances between
              them, there are several classical
minimization problems that are hard to solve
              exactly.  A
prime example is the traveling salesman problem (TSP),
where we
              want to find a cyclic tour visiting all the
points with minimum total
              distance.  These problems arise
in a wide range of applications such as
              manufacturing and
communications network design.  In the worst case it
              is
NP-hard to solve these problems even approximately, that
is with relative
              error better than some constant threshold.

Recent results show that these
              problems are easier in
metric spaces that often arise in practice.  In
              particular
if the distances are geometric, or if they are given by
shortest
              paths in a simple graph (such as a planar graph),
then the TSP and similar
              problems have approximation
schemes.  These schemes run in polynomial
              or
quasi-polynomial time, with the exponent depending on the
desired relative
              error.  The main techniques include
separators, spanners, and dynamic
              programming. In
particular a spanner is a subgraph of a given graph,
              whose
shortest path metric is a close approximation of the
original. In
              various graph families we can find spanners
with a useful tradeoff between the
              total weight and the
relative error.

This research continues the
              development of these
techniques, in particular seeking better
              spanner
constructions and possibly some useful lower bounds.  One
goal of the
              project is some progress on two unsolved
variants:  the geometric case in the
              presence of
obstacles, and the graphical case in the presence of many
extra
              ``Steiner'' points.
