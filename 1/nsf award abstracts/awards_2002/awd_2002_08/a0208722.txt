Abstract    :
              Generational garbage collection is a leading technology for
automatic and
              efficient recycling of the computer storage
occupied by a program's
              unreachable objects.  This research
seeks to develop a more quantitative
              theory of generational
garbage collection, to be based on more realistic
              analytic
models for the distribution of object lifetimes.  These
models will
              be derived by abstraction from the detailed heap
storage profiles of real
              programs, and will be evaluated by
comparing their predictions against the
              performance of actual
garbage collectors.

Insights from this research
              should lead to faster, more
space-efficient, and less intrusive algorithms for
              generational
garbage collection.
