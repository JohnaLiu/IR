With this award, Duke's seismology group will participate in
              the collaborative analyses of the passive and active seismic data that will be
              collected in the SAFOD Pilot Hole.  The group's research will include
              investigations of the near-borehole fault and velocity structure, improved
              earthquake locations using this structure, studies of earthquake-to-receiver
              path effects and earthquake source effects.  The group's participation in this
              research is based on their previous work on the structure and seismology of the
              SAFOD site and their involvement in development of borehole instruments for the
              SAFOD program.  The active seismic profiling portion of their proposal is
              linked to a complimentary proposal (recommended for funding) by the University
              of Wyoming.

The Duke Univ. group will instrument the Pilot Hole with:  1) a
              multilevel string of 3-component 12 Hz seismometers; 2) a high sensitivity,
              large dynamic range, 3-component 2 Hz seismograph, installed at the
              bottom-of-casing.  The seismic array string and 2 Hz seismograph have been
              developed in collaboration with oil-exploration instrumentation companies.  The
              new casing-bottom seismograph, seismic array string, and pressure monitor
              system will provide unique 3rd and 4th dimension (depth and time), spectral
              content and volumetric strain information on the microearthquakes that are the
              targets of the main SAFOD hole.
