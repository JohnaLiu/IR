Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Comparing urban and rural
              forests: using city environments to model long-term changes in forests under
              predicted changes in global climates."  Forests are predicted to change their
              distributions in response to global changes in atmospheric nitrogen deposition,
              carbon dioxide, and temperature. Urban forests have experienced these
              conditions for decades and represent unique systems to look for novel changes
              in the dynamics of forests under predicted global change scenarios.
