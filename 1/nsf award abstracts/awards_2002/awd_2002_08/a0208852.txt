Abstract    :
              The Timber project addresses the construction of a database system to manage
              large volumes of extensible Markup Language (XML) data. The goal is to develop
              a native XML database, in which XML data is stored directly, retaining its
              natural tree structure. At the same time, without mapping the data into
              relational tables, the objective is to obtain all the benefits thereof, such as
              declarative querying and set-at-a-time processing.  

To accomplish this
              objective, the Timber project uses a bulk algebra for the
manipulation of
              trees as a basis, and creates a principled implementation of a modular,
              algebraic framework for the optimization and evaluation of queries against XML
              data.
