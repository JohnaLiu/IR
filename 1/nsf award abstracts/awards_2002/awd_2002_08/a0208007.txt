              PROJECT SUMMARY
Across the interior American West,cattle ranches are being
              converted to subdivisions,in order to
accommodate exurban population
              expansion.What are the biodiversity consequences of this
profound land use
              change?That is the core question addressed by this proposed
              research.
Conversion of rangelands to subdivisions may negatively impact
              native biodiversity through
direct habitat loss.It has been argued that
              finding ways to keep ranchers from selling their lands
to developers is vital
              to conservation.On the other hand,most western ranches include some
public
              lands that cannot be sold,and even on private lands the developments usually
              are low
density.Therefore,western exurban development often results in
              relatively little direct habitat
loss.If a landscape is converted by scattered
              subdivisions,but simultaneously released from the
controlling influence of
              livestock grazing,will this result in net gains or losses of
              regional
biodiversity?So far,a volatile mixture of prediction and passion has
              fueled this debate,but
rarely has it been informed by data.
The purpose of
              this proposed study is to quantify components of native biodiversity in
              a
grassland/savanna in the Sonoita Valley of southeastern Arizona,where some
              cattle ranches are
being converted into subdivisions.This study will compare
              flowering plant,grasshopper,
butterfly,bird,and rodent populations in
              landscapes that are being grazed,or subdivided,or
both,or neither.It also will
              quantify the demographics of three bird species known to be
particularly
              responsive to the effects of livestock grazing and/or landscape conversion
              through
subdivision.The data will be used to test a series of hypotheses and
              predictions about the
independent and interactive effects of exurban
              development and livestock grazing on 1)species
richness and evenness of native
              biotic communities,2)invasions of exotic species into
              those
communities,3)population and community stability,and 4)avian
              demographics.
The centerpiece of this work will be the Appleton-Whittell
              Research Sanctuary,a 3200 ha
preserve that has been ungrazed and otherwise
              undisturbed since 1968,and that has been the
focus of extensive fieldwork
              since the early 1970 's.Unlike many land use studies in the West,
this one
              will have a control,to the degree that 33 years protection have permitted
              patterns of
native biodiversity to express themselves in the absence of either
              agriculture or exurban
development.
Results of this study will address basic
              and unanswered questions about the relative impacts of
local forces (livestock
              grazing)versus landscape conversion (subdivision)on biodiversity in
              arid,
non-forested western ecosystems,where 1)natural landscape heterogeneity
              is high,2)
development is distant from the controlling influences of large
              urban centers,and 3)subdivision
usually consists of scattered landscape
              intrusions rather than fragmentation of the grassland into
isolated
              patches.The study will make societal contributions that are both timely and
              urgent,
given present rates of development in the rural West,and the many
              uncertainties about its
ecological consequences.
