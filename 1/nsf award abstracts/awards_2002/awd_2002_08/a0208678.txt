An
              Algorithmic Study of Optimal Multiresolution Quantization and Joint
              Source-Channel Coding

In this research project the investigators will
              develop algorithms to improve service quality of video and audio streaming over
              switched networks, wired or wireless, in adverse network conditions such as
              congestion, delay, and packet loss.  The idea is to have graceful degradation
              in quality of service rather than outright stoppage of audio and video
              playback, when the effective transmission rate drops.  This will significantly
              enrich users' experience with IP-based multimedia services.

The research
              consists of two inter-connected studies: optimal multiresolution (progressively
              refinable) quantization (MRQ), and uneven error-protected packetization (UEPP)
              of scalable source code streams generated by MRQ.  The investigators' main
              objective is to develop efficient algorithms for optimal MRQ design, and for
              optimal bit allocation between scalable source codes of MRQ and forward error
              correction codes.  Their approach differs from the existing rich body of
              literature on joint source-channel coding and on MRQ in that the problem is
              treated as one of combinatorial optimization, rather than resorting to
              continuous Lagrangian optimization.  The investigators will classify various
              optimization problems related to MRQ design and joint source-channel coding by
              their innate computational tractability, and develop either globally optimal
              algorithms for those that are solvable in polynomial time, or heuristic
              algorithms for those that are NP-hard.  In order to obtain efficient algorithms
              for MRQ and UEPP, discrete structures of the underlying objective functions of
              optimization will be explored, which in turn may offer new insights into these
              problems of increasing interest and immediate relevance to internet and
              wireless communications.
