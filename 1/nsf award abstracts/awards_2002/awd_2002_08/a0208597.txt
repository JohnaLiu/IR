Abstract    :
              Abstract:
  As the recording technology further matures, more complex
              coding
algorithms for recording channels are challenging integrated
              circuit
manufacturing technology limits. The implementation of recent
              major
conceptual advances in coding theory, including iterative
              decoding,
codes on graphs as well as constrained codes, has been limited
              mainly by
the speed and recording density requirements of modern
              recording
systems. This research is developing coding schemes for
ultra-fast
              high-density recording systems that can lend themselves to
very low complexity
              implementations.
  The focus of the research is the idea that good codes can
              be
constructed without using random interleavers or random sparse
              parity
check matrices. The constructions are based on combinatorial
designs
              and finite geometries. Such codes have a simple and well-defined
structure,
              which means lower decoder complexity. This approach also
offers a large
              flexibility in choosing code parameters. The fundamental
code construction
              issues addressed in this research include
understanding a structure of good
              codes and tradeoffs among code length,
rate and structure as well as matching
              a code to a partial response
channel. The second class of codes studied in
              this research are
constrained codes and graph constrained codes.
