Abstract    :
              This study investigates the mechanisms of solar chromospheric heating in
              relation to photospheric dynamics.  The data available focus on NOAA Active
              Region 8844, and feature observations from various satellites (Yohkoh, SoHO,
              and TRACE) as well as a unique balloon-borne experiment (Flare Genesis
              Experiment).  Analysis should determine not only the photospheric magnetic and
              velocity fields, but also the electron temperature and emission measure in the
              overlying transition region.  Particular emphasis will be placed on
              understanding small-scale transient phenomena like Ellerman bombs.  At the
              final stage of the project, these events will be modeled by cellular automata
              models incorporating the self-organized critical behavior of the solar
              atmosphere, as well as by deterministic hydrodynamic and magneto-hydrodynamic
              calculations.
