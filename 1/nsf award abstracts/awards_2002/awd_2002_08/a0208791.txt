Abstract    :
              Mixing in turbulent flows play an essential role in diverse
              engineering
applications. Beneficial non-equilibrium dynamics impact on
              engine
efficiency, durability, stability, and emissions, on reduced drag
              in
aircrafts and in naval vessels. The unique focus of this research is
              on
feedback regulation of active mixing control. Technical challenges are
an
              outgrowth of the complexity and sensitivity of fluid dynamic systems,
and
              require an integrated approach to modeling, information technology,
control
              theory, algorithm development, and software and hardware
implementation. 
              Modeling will focus on dominant coherent structures,
periodicity, and concepts
              of Hamiltonian energy.  Those provide also
possibilities for efficient
              parallel implementation on an embedded
system. Intended models will range from
              lumped point vortex models, to
purely phenomenologically derived I/O
              correlations of main structures.
Hybrid models arise naturally as a design
              framework, subject to (nearly)
periodic vortex generation and elimination. On
              a finer time scale,
hybrid models will be used as a means to parallelize
              spatially
distributed control and observer implementation. This project
              includes
collaborations with industry, government and academe. If
              successful,
this high risk-high yield undertaking will include both
              technology
transition in critical applications and developments of
              integrated
embedded systems and control design methods for interesting classes
              of
complex, nonlinear systems.
