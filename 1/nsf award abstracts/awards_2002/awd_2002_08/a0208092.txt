     The investigator studies computational aspects of
              nonlinear
dynamical systems, emphasizing the role of chaotic dynamics in
the
              interpretation of long-time simulation outcomes and data from
complicated
              dynamical processes.  The work on simulation is an
ongoing study of subtle
              biases occurring in deterministic
modeling that have macroscopic effects on
              outcomes.  It is an
open question whether it is possible in principle for
              long-term
computer simulations of typical nonhyperbolic chaotic systems
              to
approximately match true system behavior.  The second major area
is
              ongoing work on the interpretation of physical and biological
experiments that
              generate aperiodic data.  There is a long history
of applying random modeling
              to time series and spike timing data
collected from laaboratory and natural
              processes.  The
investigator syudies ways to use dynamical systems
              techniques,
including embedding theory and spike train reconstruction,
              to
extend the power of deterministic modeling for experimental data.
    
              Computer simulation is a critical ingredient of modern
science.  It is
              important to know whether solutions of a
mathematical model used for
              simulation can be expected to be
accurate qualitative and quantitative
              representations of the
natural phenomena being modeled, in the face of small
              modeling
errors, and whether computer solution of the model can
              represent
solutions of the model, in the face of small floating point
errors.
               This reseach builds a foundation for answering questions
like this for
              physically relevant models.  In particular the
investigator is involved in
              isolating and quantifying the
limitations of deterministic representations,
              especially for the
purpose of long-term modeling.  The second major focus of
              the
project is the interpretation of data collected from experimental
systems
              and nature when no first-principles mathematical or
computer model is
              available.  If time traces of physically
relevant quantities can be measured
              from the process, techniques
exist to attempt to reconstruct the dynamical
              behavior of the
process, with potential to predict or control the
              process.
Complex deterministic time series are being identified in
physical,
              chemical, engineering and biological/medical settings.
The investigator has
              made previous progress on expanding these
conceptual foundations and
              developing related computational
implementations, and is working to increase
              their power for the
study of complex systems in scientific and
              engineering-related
contexts.
