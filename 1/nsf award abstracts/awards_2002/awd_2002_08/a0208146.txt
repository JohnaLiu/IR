Abstract    :
              
The researcher is concerned that the number of women who participate in
              Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology (STEM) education is lower
              than that of young men.  This study seeks to understand better how young
              African American women, who appear to be interested and engaged in science
              during high school years, remain underrepresented in STEM courses in college. 
              The project creates new data collection technologies to find unique gender
              subcultures of African American communities that contribute to their
              decision-making.  It is hypothesized that factors that discourage young women
              involve interactions at the university that reflect gender and race bias. 
              

The study will first analyze a national data set (NELS) to obtain national
              estimates of rates of transition of women and men in the science pipeline. 
              Then it will create a method to assess the perceptions of science experiences
              and factors involving interactions with other people that encourage, or
              discourage, women to enter science professions.  She would develop measures of
              perceptions of science experiences that might help explain why trends in
              attitudes toward science observed with NELS data were found.
