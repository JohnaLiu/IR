This project undertakes studies of two active
              fault systems in Taiwan, the Chelungpu and Longitudinal Valley faults, which
              ruptured during large earthquakes in 1999 and 1951, in order to address
              recurrence fault behavior and the temporal variability of rupture modes.
              Acquisition of rupture time series on the Chelungpu and Longitudinal Valley
              faults provide constraints on physical models of serial fault rupture and fault
              interactions. These results bear on seismic hazard analysis, by considering the
              physical processes that lead to an earthquake, including the interaction of
              adjacent fault ruptures, the effect of prior ruptures on a fault, the influence
              of geologic structure and fault geometry on rupture termination and aseismic
              versus seismic behavior.

Paleoseismic studies along the Chelungpu fault are
              characterizing its earthquake recurrence and displacement history. For example,
              if the recurrence of 1999-like earthquakes is far less frequent, then other
              structures at the same latitude would have to play an important role in strain
              relief. Results from these investigations have implications for understanding
              the physical processes of strain relief on individual faults and of mountain
              building. End-member hypotheses, ranging from unpatterned or random recurrence
              to highly clustered behavior, are being tested using earthquake time histories
              obtained along the Chelungpu and adjacent reverse faults.

The project also
              characterizes the active faults of the Longitudinal Valley faults. Determining
              the elevations of shoreline angles for a select handful of coastal marine
              terraces is constraining the millennial rates along the Longitudinal Valley.
              Geologic mapping and dating of the fluvial terraces along Shiouguluan River are
              providing the time-averaged uplift rates between the Longitudinal Valley and
              the eastern coastal region.
