Abstract    :
              The proposed research focuses on the design and implementation of
              new
technologies for building high-confidence component software systems.  The
              new
technology is directly relevant to improving security of
              commercial
virtual machines such as the Java virtual machine (JVM)
              and
Microsoft's .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR).  The work concentrates
on
              three areas:

1. High-level specifications for low-level software.  General
              and
flexible logic-based type systems (LTS) are being designed.  The
              type
systems are derived from the Certified Binaries technology developed
by
              the authors and extend the scope, expressiveness and precision of
verification
              techniques used in current JVM and CLR implementations.

2. A high-assurance
              virtual machine.  Using the authors Foundational
Proof-Carrying Code
              technology, higher-assurance, validated
implementations of the JVM or CLR
              infrastructure are being built.  The
authors are engaged in technology
              transfer of their ideas to a virtual
machine being built at Intel.

3.
              Resource certification.  New technologies for specifying,
composing, and
              verifying advanced properties such as resource bounds
on memory and network
              bandwidth are being developed.  These
properties are crucial for safe and
              secure interoperation between
untrusted components in large-scale systems.
