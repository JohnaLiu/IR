Abstract    :
              The research in this proposal aims to advance fundamental
knowledge of routing
              methods that trade off optimality in return for
space, time, locality,
              fault-tolerance, and adaptability to changing
network topology. The study of
              multi-criteria routing problems is also
commenced, where for even the most
              natural and simply-stated multi-criteria
routing problems, there are typically
              only heuristics known. The goal
is to produce methods that trade off some
              optimality of the solution
in returned for lowered computational resurces, in
              a quantifiable way. 

Approximate shortest-paths, compact routing, and
              distance labeling
problems will be studied, along with their extensions to
              directed
networks, dynamic networks, and multi-criteria formulations
              
incorporating different tradeoffs of time and space with measures of
risk
              and reliability.
