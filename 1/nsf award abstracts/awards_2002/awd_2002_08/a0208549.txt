Abstract    :
              The objectives of the Cryptyc project are to develop a Cryptographic Protocol
              Type Checker, which allows secrecy and authenticity properties of cryptographic
              protocols to be specified as types.  A formal type soundness proof shows that
              any protocol which passes the type checker is guaranteed to satisfy its secrecy
              and authenticity requirements.

Prior work on the Cryptyc project has
              developed a theory and tool which deals with many, but not all, cryptographic
              techniques and attacker models.  This project extends the Cryptyc system to
              include
support for more advanced cryptographic primitives, more sophisticated
              attacker models, object-based component architectures, and applies the Cryptyc
              system to the development of secure component libraries for cryptographic
              protocols.
