H2O (water) greatly influences many
              processes in the Earth.  It is the most important factor in determining if a
              volcanic eruption will be explosive or not.  The presence of small amounts of
              water in the minerals making up the Earth's mantle can weaken normally rigid
              minerals allowing the mantle to flow at geologically high velocities.
In this
              project, we will conduct experiments at high temperatures and pressures to
              determine which hydrous minerals, if any, can be present in subducting oceanic
              crust, and at what depths those minerals dehydrate.  Such dehydration
              ultimately results in the formation of water-rich magmas that often erupt very
              explosively.
We also will do experiments to determine how much water can
              dissolve in the crystal structure of the common minerals (olivine, pyroxene,
              garnet) in the Earth's upper mantle that do not contain specific structural
              sites for H2O.  The presence of even small amounts of water in such minerals is
              important because the minerals are so abundant in the Earth's mantle that the
              aggregate water contained in them may equal one or more times the total volume
              contained in the world's oceans.  Additionally, the effect of dissolved water
              in those minerals causes drastic changes in their strength (or viscosity) and
              the velocity of seismic waves travelling through the mantle. 
We will use a
              variety of modern very high-pressure devices and advanced techniques for
              chemical analysis to complete the objectives of this project.
