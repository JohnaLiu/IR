In the Red Sea region, a continental shield has
              rifted to form an incipient ocean basin. Several stages of the continental
              rifting process are evident in the region, ranging from the formation of
              genuine oceanic crust in central Red Sea to transcurrent pull-apart motion
              along the Dead Sea transform. Surface features of this rifting are well mapped,
              but the extent and geometry of ductile shear in the underlying lower crust and
              mantle lithosphere are unknown. The use of seismic anisotropy as a proxy for
              the deformation of the lower crust and upper mantle became widespread with the
              advent of broadband digital seismic data recording. However, only a small
              subset of data available from permanent seismic observatories in the Red Sea
              region has been explored with techniques that address anisotropic properties
              directly. The investigators will study the structure and the texture of the
              lower crust and the shallow mantle in the Red Sea region using seismic
              observables that diagnose elastic anisotropy - teleseismic shear wave splitting
              and receiver functions. These two techniques are largely complementary: 
              shear-wave splitting integrates anisotropy along the path of a shear wave, 
              while P-S converted waves are sensitive to velocity and anisotropy jumps at
              interfaces. Together they offer a way to constrain vertical variations in
              anisotropic properties, which should allow us to distinguish inherited rock
              textures within the Proterozoic-age lithosphere from textures associated with
              the ongoing continental break-up.
