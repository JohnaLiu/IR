Abstract    :
              Optimization problems that arise in practice are often inherently
online; that
              is, the input data is not available prior to
computation but, instead, is
              given as a sequence of requests
each of which must be served before the next
              one is received.
A classical example is the caching problem in two-level
              memory
systems. Modern computer architectures enhance memory performance
by
              storing frequently accessed data items in a cache, which is
a small buffer
              memory. Memory locations stored in the cache
can be accessed quickly. Requests
              to memory locations that are
not in the cache are called faults or misses, and
              take much
more time.  After each memory access, an online caching
              algorithm
needs to decide whether to put the requested item in the cache,
and
              if so, which item to evict from the cache. The objective
is to minimize the
              number of cache faults.

Due to incomplete information, online algorithms
              cannot, in general,
compute optimal solutions. This brings up the issue of
              performance
evaluation: how do we tell good algorithms from bad ones? One
              measure
of the quality of online algorithms is their competitive
              ratio,
defined as the maximum, over all request sequences, of the
              ratios
between the solution computed by the online algorithm and the
              optimal
(offline) solution. Thus, an algorithm with competitive ratio,
              say,
1.5, always computes a solution that is within 50% of the
              minimum.

This research deals with the competitive analysis of online
              algorithms.
Several research directions are being explored. The first
              direction
is to study general techniques for the design and analysis of
              online
algorithms. Here, the most promising ideas include the
work-function
              algorithm (and its extensions) and the primal-dual method.
Both of these
              techniques, as well as some other, have been successfully
applied to specific
              online problems, but the mechanism behind their
success is still poorly
              understood, and they still require an in-depth
study to determine their
              applicability to other problems. Another
direction is to study several
              extensions of the competitive analysis,
including access graphs (for caching),
              diffuse adversaries, loose
competitiveness and resource augmentation. This
              work focuses on some open
problems related to these models, on adapting these
              models to other
online problems, and on designing new problem-specific models.
              The
investigator is also continuing his work on several classical
problems in
              competitive analysis, including the k-server
problem, several versions of
              caching and scheduling problems,
the k-median problem, and other. The main
              goals of these efforts
are to develop efficient competitive algorithms for
              these problems
and to establish matching lower bounds on the competitive
              ratios.
