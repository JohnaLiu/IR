Abstract    :
              The access control model plays a central role in most of computer
security. It
              is pervasive, and provides a basis for secrecy and
integrity security
              policies. Authentication and authorization are two
of the fundamental
              components of this model. In a distributed system,
authentication and
              authorization are harder, in particular because of
the heterogeneity and the
              autonomy of subsystems.

This project addresses problems and opportunities
              related to access
control in distributed systems. It aims to further the
              design and
analysis of models and mechanisms for authentication
              and
authorization. In particular, it investigates the design and analysis
of
              protocols for authentication and related purposes. It also
investigates
              fine-grained authorization in extensible software
systems. Some parts of this
              project are rather informal; others
exploit ideas from programming-language
              research and rely on the
development of formal calculi.
