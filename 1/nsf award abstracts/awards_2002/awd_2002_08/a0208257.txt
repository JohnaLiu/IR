Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Transformation of neural signals
              across single neurons."  This project addresses the physiological and
              biophysical mechanisms of individual neurons that underlie phase-coding in barn
              owls, specifically how they encode time.  First, it will focus on verifying the
              presence of a subthreshold presynaptic code in postsynaptic cells.  Second,
              morphological and physiological characteristics of the synapse will be
              determined.
