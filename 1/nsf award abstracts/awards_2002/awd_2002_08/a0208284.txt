The investigators propose to better image seismic
              velocity discontinuities in the mid-upper mantle using broadband Ps and other
              scattered teleseismic phases.  They will focus on structure in the 150-400 km
              depth range, where a rich variety of discontinuity structures have been
              observed.  Testable hypotheses for the origin of these features include: the
              transition from dislocation creep to diffusion creep, layers of rheological
              weakness due to volatile enrichment, layers of partial melt, mechanical
              boundaries within the continental lithosphere, and mineralogical phase
              transformations.  The various mechanisms imply differences in discontinuity
              depth, polarity, strength and anisotropic properties, and some of these
              predictions vary between tectonic environments due to changes in mantle
              temperature.  These predictions will be compared to observed discontinuity
              structure globally (using IRIS/Global Seismic Network stations), and with
              focused regional studies in continental cratons, actively deforming continental
              regions, subduction zones, and beneath a mid-ocean ridge (using data from
              PASSCAL experiments and other arrays).  Two types of migration will be
              employed: determination of receiver functions by simultaneous deconvolution of
              data from different geographic or back-azimuth bins, and formal 2D migration.
              Receiver function binning as a function of back-azimuth is particularly
              effective at resolving anisotropy, and the proposed 2D migration has great
              potential to constrain both P-wave and S-wave velocity contrasts at
              discontinuities.  This work will help to characterize mid-upper mantle
              rheology, deformation mechanism, anisotropic fabric, and volatile and melt
              distributions.
