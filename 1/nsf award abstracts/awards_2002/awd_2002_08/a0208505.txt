This project undertakes studies of two active fault
              systems in Taiwan, the Chelungpu and Longitudinal Valley faults, which ruptured
              during large earthquakes in 1999 and 1951, in order to address recurrence fault
              behavior and the temporal variability of rupture modes. Acquisition of rupture
              time series on the Chelungpu and Longitudinal Valley faults provide constraints
              on physical models of serial fault rupture and fault interactions.  These
              results bear on seismic hazard analysis, by considering the physical processes
              that lead to an earthquake, including the interaction of adjacent fault
              ruptures, the effect of prior ruptures on a fault, the influence of geologic
              structure and fault geometry on rupture termination and aseismic versus seismic
              behavior.

Paleoseismic studies along the Chelungpu fault are characterizing
              its earthquake recurrence and displacement history. For example, if the
              recurrence of 1999-like earthquakes is far less frequent, then other structures
              at the same latitude would have to play an important role in strain relief.
              Results from these investigations have implications for understanding the
              physical processes of strain relief on individual faults and of mountain
              building. End-member hypotheses, ranging from unpatterned or random recurrence
              to highly clustered behavior, are being tested using earthquake time histories
              obtained along the Chelungpu and adjacent reverse faults.

The project also
              characterizes the active faults of the Longitudinal Valley faults. Determining
              the elevations of shoreline angles for a select handful of coastal marine
              terraces is constraining the millennial rates along the Longitudinal Valley.
              Geologic mapping and dating of the fluvial terraces along Shiouguluan River are
              providing the time-averaged uplift rates between the Longitudinal Valley and
              the eastern coastal region.
