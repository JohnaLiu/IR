Abstract    :
              Handheld computing devices with wireless network connections
 have a great
              potential to be powerful mobile tools to
 access information and software
              resources in the networked
 world.  Unfortunately, the computing power
 and
              connection time of current handheld devices
 are severely constrained by the
              short battery life.
 Moreover, the battery issue also places constraints on

              various design aspects including program memory and secondary
 storage, CPU,
              and operating system.
 
 With connection to computing servers through
              wireless networks,
 there exist many opportunities for handheld devices to

              save battery by carefully utilizing the power of the servers.
 This project
              explores compiler and run-time techniques
 to assist the partitioning of
              application programs into
 server tasks and client tasks.  The optimal
              partition
 depends on available network bandwidth and on the nature
 of
              applications.  In order for handheld devices to optimally
 exploit servers for
              a wide range of applications, careful
 tradeoff is made between energy
              consumed by network communication
 versus computation.
 
 The proposed
              compiler techniques and run-time support
 include compile-time and run-time
              analysis of work and
 communication requirement, exploitation
 of low-power
              networking states on handhelds, run-time
 decision-making, and a light-weight
              software coherence mechanism.
