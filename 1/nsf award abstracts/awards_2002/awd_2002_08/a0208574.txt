Abstract    :
              This project is to develop enabling techniques for a large-scale
metasearch
              engine that aims at covering a much larger portion of the
Web and at the same
              time retrieving more up-to-date and more useful
documents than existing search
              engines and metasearch engines. A
metasearch engine is a system that supports
              unified access to multiple
existing search engines. It is estimated that there
              are hundreds of
thousands of search engines on the Web (including deep Web).
              The
proposed metasearch engine (WebScales) will attempt to connect to
as many
              of these search engines as possible. The focus of the research
is on advancing
              highly scalable distributed information retrieval
technology and the research
              issues to be investigated in this project 
include (1) how to discover these
              search engines automatically, (2) 
how to incorporate them into the proposed
              metasearch engine automatically, (3) how to identify potentially useful search
              engines to use for any given user query submitted to the metasearch engine, and
              (4) how to achieve high retrieval effectiveness.
