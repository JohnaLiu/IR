Abstract    :
              This Post Doctoral Fellowship in the Social and Behavioral Sciences seeks to
              evaluate whether the basic literacy skills of African American children are
              enhanced through culture-specific instruction and computer technology. In an
              after school setting, students will receive reading instruction in one of four
              distinct instructional contexts that vary in culture-specific materials,
              software applications; and computer-based learning environments. This study
              will investigate whether the expected learning enhancement in the culturally
              congruent learning context for African American children occurs with other
              another minority group, Latino, and Anglo children. Moreover, students' reading
              performance after receiving instruction in computer versus non-computer
              contexts will be determined. Finally, the relationship between all students
              engagement levels and reading performance in the four instructional contexts
              will be assessed. Results will contribute to the development of comprehensive
              culturally responsive learning strategies in other cognitive domains. The
              Fellow, Dr. Juanita Cole, received her doctorate in psychology from Howard
              University. During her two year NSF post-doctoral fellowship, she will be under
              the sponsorship of Dr. Michael Cole at the University of California, San Diego
              Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition.
