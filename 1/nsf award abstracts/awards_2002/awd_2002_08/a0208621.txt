Abstract    :
              With the enormous stream of electronic data being continually generated,
it is
              imperative to use unsupervised methods to organize and explore
the data.  The
              enormous quantity of data precludes the use of supervised
methods.  The goal
              of this project is to develop unsupervised methods
capable of organizing and
              annotating large datasets of unknown structure,
facilitating further
              exploration and analysis of the data.

With the recent advent of general
              purpose, scalable, unsupervised
clustering methods such as Principal Direction
              Divisive Partitioning
(PDDP), whole new vistas open up in the uses and
              applications of
unsupervised methods.  This particular method yields
              additional
by-products for free: a hierarchical structure, and identification
              of
the most distinctive attributes.  These by-products are just the
              items
needed to impose a structure on a dataset and annotate the
              computed
structure at various levels of detail.

This naturally leads to
              this project: to develop scalable general
purpose clustering methods, to
              extract the information needed to
annotate the datasets so users can
              effectively navigate through the
data, and to perform the associated
              statistical and theoretical analyses.
The methods will be validated on a wide
              variety of domains, including the
WWW, specialized legal and/or medical
              databases, astronomical catalogs,
and genomics.
