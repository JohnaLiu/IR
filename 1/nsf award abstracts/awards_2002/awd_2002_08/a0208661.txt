Abstract    :
              

Through this planning effort, Knoxville College will develop comprehensive
              approaches to increase the number of undergraduate students graduating in good
              standing in science, mathematics, and technology (SMT), as well as the number
              of non-SMT majors who develop basic science literacy as undergraduates.
              Specific objectives for this planning initiative include the development:
o of
              strategies to improve the Knoxville College undergraduate SMT curriculum and
              its delivery including content, faculty development, equipment and facilities,
              and technology;
o of a strategy to provide students with meaningful internship
              opportunities that complement their undergraduate SMT experience;
o of
              entrepreneurial science and technology partnerships with industry; and 
o a
              comprehensive multi-year implementation plan outlining a vision, needs,
              resources, and outcomes for the objectives above.

This initiative addresses
              the Nation's need of to broaden participation in science and technology, and to
              expand the scientific literacy of all citizens.
