Abstract    :
              This research investigates the ways geographic mobility and communications,
              including computer-mediated communication, influence the formation, 
              maintenance, and dissolution of personal and work relationships and the ways
              these factors influence people's ability to extract social resources from them.
              Maintaining personal relationships requires significant investment in time and
              money. Physical proximity makes building personal relationships easier, while
              geographic mobility puts relationships at risk. Large numbers of Americans are
              now using the Internet, with electronic mail and other services for
              interpersonal communication. The Internet can potentially reduce the
              constraints that geography imposes on social relationships.  It may also
              influence the quality of relationships conducted online. This research examines
              whether use of Internet communication changes the number and quality of social
              relationships and the social support derived from them.  By examining the
              content of communication conducted over different modalities (visits, phone
              calls, email and instant messaging), it will help identify the mechanisms
              through which communication leads to social support. The research will
              simultaneously be of interest to social scientists concerned with the basic
              processes underlying social and work relationships and to more applied
              researchers and policy makers interested in the impact of the Internet on
              social life.
