	The PI and his colleagues have
              established a new high-resolution reference column of the layered series of the
              Skaergaard intrusion from drill core from the Platinova exploration program in
              1989-90 and surface samples collected and located by GPS during the summer of
              2000.  This was done as a collaboration between U.S. and Danish scientists, and
              students. Skaergaard differentiation has been highly controversial and the
              divergence of opinions is likely to remain unless new fundamental observations
              are brought to bear on the problems. The primary objective of this proposal is
              to document the petrology and geochemistry of this stratigraphically controlled
              suite of previously collected drill core and surface samples using well
              established petrographical and analytical tools. This composite stratigraphic
              column will provide a basis for rigorous hypothesis testing of the mechanisms
              of Skaergaard evolution that have eluded petrologists in the absence of good
              stratigraphic control. The main product will be a detailed mineralogical and
              chemical stratigraphy at a sampling interval of 10 m and less. Observations
              will be linked to the analysis of the physical factors that govern the behavior
              of the crystallizing magma and its liquid line of descent. This will provide
              the foundation for evaluating the roles of crystal sedimentation, in-situ
              crystallization, compaction, and infiltration metasomatism at Skaergaard and
              other layered igneous intrusions.
