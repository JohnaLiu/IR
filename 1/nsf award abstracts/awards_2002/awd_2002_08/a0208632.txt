This award supports a pilot Korea-U.S. science and
              engineering summer camp for high school students.  The camp is organized as a
              joint effort between the American Association for the Advancement of Science
              (AAAS) and the Korea Science Foundation, with partial funding for U.S.
              participation from the Korea-U.S. Science Cooperation Center and the National
              Science Foundation.  The pilot camp in July 2002 in Korea will involve 21
              American students and 7 adult supervisors/mentors.  This program will provide
              an opportunity for American participants to join with Korean students and
              researchers in a hands-on science, technology, engineering and mathematics
              research experience.  The outcome will be early exposure to research
              experiences, involvement in innovative projects developed by teams of student
              participants, learning about the research process and careers, improved
              awareness of international scientific and engineering cooperation, and
              increased understanding of how research is approached in a different
              society/culture.
