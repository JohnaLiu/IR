Abstract    :
              This project is a study of computational complexity theory, in particular
a
              study of structural complexity theory and some compelxity problems
relating to
              lattice problems.  Computational complexity theory is
the study of the
              inherent hardness of computational problems, both
in the worst-case measure as
              well as in the average-case measure.
This theory is the underpinning of all
              computer security based on the
hardness or insolvability of computational
              problems.

The investigator will study the interrelationship between a number
              of
complexity classes, especially those between determinisitic P and
              the
second level of the polynomial time hierarchy, building on the
              recent
breakthrough concerning the class S2, the symmetric second level class
              of
the hierarchy.  The investigator also explores a notion of
              persistent
NP-hardness.  This is to be an intermediate level of
              complexity
measure between worst-case hardness and average-case complexity
in
              the framework of Levin and others. In lattice problems, 
the investigator will
              search for  moderately efficient algorithms
for the shortest vector problem
              and the closest vector problem,
both in the worst case measure as well as in
              the average case measure.
The investigator will study their connections to
              random lattices,
and potential applications to the design of secure
              public-key
cryptosystems based on assumptions of hadness in the worst case
              
complexity only.
