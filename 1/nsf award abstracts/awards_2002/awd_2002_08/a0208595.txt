Abstract    :
              Kolmogorov complexity is a modern theory of randomness
and has many
              applications in computer science and
other fields. The investigator is
              enriching this theory
and its applications by doing research in two
              directions.

Analyzing the average-case complexity of an algorithm
is at the
              heart of practical algorithm analysis. 
It has been demonstrated over the past
              decade that 
Kolmogorov complexity is a powerful tool to help analyzing the
              
average-case complexity and the lower bounds of algorithms.
Examples are the
              average case analysis of Shellsort and Heapsort.
The PI plans to continue this
              work to systematically develop 
the tool, the Incompressibility Method.  This
              involves comparative 
studies to understand why, how, and when 
the
              incompressibility method
works. In order to demonstrate, and to uncover,
the
              power of this method, this method will be used to solve 
other open questions.
              Samples of some open questions include: 
improving Shellsort average-case
              lower bound analysis, 
average height of balanced trees, and Stack sorting
              lower bound.
 
The modern information age and the post-genomic era raises a
              
fundamental question: Given two sequences (genomes or English
documents),
              how much information do they share? For example,
given two genomes, can we
              measure their evolutionary distance? 
The goal of this second part of the
              proposal is to understand 
this fundamental question and develop tools.
In
              the past, the PI and his coauthors have partially answered this
question by
              defining the concept of Information Distance. 
Information Distance measures
              the absolute
thermodynamic energy required to convert one sequence to
              another.
However, it does not measure evolutionary distance because
genomic
              evolution allows long segment deletion/insertion, cheaply.
A new theory
              suitable for such evolutionary distance will be
developed.  To demonstrate the
              feasibility of this research,
some preliminary theory has been proposed and
              successfully applied to 
construct whole genome and chain letter phylogenies
              when no other
method applies. More recently, this theory has also
              been
applied to program plagiarism detection and language classification.
