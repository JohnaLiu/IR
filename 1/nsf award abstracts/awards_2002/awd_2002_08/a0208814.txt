Abstract    :
                   The investigators organize the Gordon Research Conference on
Theoretical
              Biology and Biomathematics.  The conference has nine
formal sessions, each
              consisting of 2-3 oral presentations with
an introduction by a leading
              scientist in the area, and two
afternoon poster sessions.  A wide variety of
              topics, ranging
from global environmental models to mathematical neuroscience
              to
genetic regulation networks, are represented.  The unifying theme
of the
              conference is quantitative modeling of complex biological
networks.  Invited
              speakers are selected on the basis of their
expertise in the respective areas,
              at the same time emphasizing
gender balance, minority representation, and
              incorporating
promising junior researchers.
     The primary goal of this
              conference is to bring together
established and young investigators from the
              field of
quantitative biology to share their approaches and progress and
to
              discuss the perspectives.  Such a multidisciplinary conference
is very
              important for identifying challenges in biology,
biotechnology, and medicine
              that require quantitative modeling
and computational approach.  Moreover, the
              participation of
students and postdocs helps to increase the number of
              people
working in areas of quantitative biology.
