Abstract    :
              The project will conduct research in the following topics:

The design,
              implementation and testing of scalable method that uses self-similarity to
              cluster numerical data sets.The design, implementation and testing of a
              scalable method that uses entropy to cluster categorical data sets, based on
              the notion entropy.The design, implementation of testing of a scalable method
              of clustering mixed data sets.The research will have an impact on the following
              applications.Projective clustering: The project aim to use a combination of a
              clustering algorithms and singular value decomposition to discover the
              dimensions that are most relevant to each cluster in high dimensional data
              set.Tracking clusters in evolving data streams: The methods proposed are
              characterized by a concise representation of the clusters that have been found
              at a given point, and therefore allow the clustering of continuously incoming
              data streams.
Labeling data through clustering: The incremental methods
              developed in the project to obtain new training data for classification
              algorithms.
