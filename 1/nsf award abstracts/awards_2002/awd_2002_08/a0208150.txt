Lower crustal and upper mantle rocks commonly show
              localized ductile shear zones, characterized by a finer grain size than the
              host rocks; such strain localization implies a strain weakening process.
              Dynamic recrystallization accompanying dislocation creep is a major process
              tending to reduce grain size, and several distinct mechanisms of dynamic
              recrystallization have been identified; for quartz these define three 'regimes'
              of dislocation creep, with distinctly different microstructures as well as
              mechanical behavior. The low temperature, higher stress process of grain
              boundary bulging produces strain weakening and localization in both quartz and
              feldspar, whereas the higher temperature process of subgrain rotation does not.
              Previous work on olivine has focussed on high temperature, low stress creep,
              although there are indications of bulging recrystallization and strain
              localization at lower temperatures. The goals of this project are to quantify
              the constitutive behavior and piezometer relation for bulging recrystallization
              in quartz, and for olivine to verify the existence of this process, determine
              the conditions over which it operates, and quantify the strain weakening it
              produces. The results should allow more accurate modelling of lithospheric
              deformation.
