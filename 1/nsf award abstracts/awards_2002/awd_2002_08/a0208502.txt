This research project is designed to accomplish two aims: 
              Aim 1:  To construct and array high-quality BAC libraries to provide a genomic
              resource on a wide range of species.  Aim 2:  To enable researchers working
              with green algae, non-seed land plants, and seed plants (including flowering
              plants) to identify genes critical for understanding plant form and function
              and how land plants arose and diversified.  This project will enable progress
              toward an understanding of the genetic basis for the transitions that mark the
              most fundamentally important steps in green plant evolution.  The Deep Green
              community (http://ucjeps.herb.berkeley.edu/bryolab/deepgene/index.html) will
              help to provide an infrastructure for ongoing scientific exchange. 
              Bioinformatics and a web site will be provided to the community to access these
              resources (http://www.genome.clemson.edu/).
