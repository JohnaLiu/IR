Abstract    :
              This research will develop advanced digital signal processing algorithms for
              specific
coherent imaging systems where complex signals are spatially and
              temporally sampled,
and subsequently processed by computers.Modeling of the
              physics of data acquisition
will play a crucial role throughout the signal
              processing chain,from preprocessing at the
sensor level to adaptive
              processing/beamforming and final image formation.The focal
research areas will
              involve ultra wide band medical ultrasound imaging,and
electromagnetic wave
              imaging in millimeter spectral bands.Millimeter electromagnetic
wave imaging
              could have important anti-terrorism applications such as detection of
plastic
              guns and knives in human body scanning at airports,and surveillance of
              suspected
safe houses,storage areas,and cargos by imaging through walls or
              crates.
In the medical ultrasound area,the research will involve the following
              specific topics:(1)
optimal transmit/receive beam forming for near field
              dynamic focusing;(2)multiple foci
B scan imaging for increasing scan
              rates;(3).theoretical performance bounds associated
with combined random
              processes of random scatterers and noise.and (4),phase
aberration correction
              algorithms for 3-D systems including new methods for dealing with
dispersed
              aberrators such as fat lobules,membranes,etc.,that can diffract and refract
              the
ultrasound beams.The research in electromagnetic coherent imaging will
              involve:
synergistic adaptation of the statistical ultrasound
              autofocusing/phase aberration
correction concepts to the electromagnetic
              spectrum;development of millimeter wa e
imaging algorithms for surveillance
              functions such as rapid body scanning and imaging
through thin dry medium such
              as wood,plaster board or stone.The research in all the
coherent modalities
              will involve:development of practical fast converging computer
implementations
              of reconstruction algorithms;extensive simulations,and performance
analyses of
              the new models and algorithms.
