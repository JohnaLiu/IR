Large amounts of water are carried into the
              upper mantle by subduction. It is generally assumed that water is released in
              near continuous fashion to depths of at least 150-200 km. However, it is
              unknown how water is transported from the slab to the volcanic front. Water in
              the mantle wedge strongly influences rheological and seismological properties
              and has a major impact on subduction zone thermal structure. The investigators
              propose to study the influence of water on mantle wedge dynamics in a
              collaborative and multi-disciplinary project. Recent rheological work has made
              it possible, for the first time, to quantify the influence of water on creep
              properties of olivine.   The investigators will systematically study the
              rheological influence of water, with particular interest in how the
              observationally inferred water distribution influences the balance of
              subduction forces and the generation of the cornerflow. The models provide
              predictions on subduction zone temperature and composition that allow for
              critical tests using observational and experimental constraints from seismology
              and mineral physics.
