Abstract    :
              Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG+) magnetograms will be employed as the
              principal data set to study the evolution of the solar photospheric magnetic
              field, and its relationship with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Potential-field
              source-surface (PFSS) coronal models will be constructed using the GONG+ data
              to specify the inner boundary condition. These will form the basis for the
              synthesis of specialized synoptic maps aimed at, (1) establishing the location
              of source surface magnetic neutral lines, (2) predicting solar wind
              characteristics based on the Wang-Sheeley model, and (3) delineating the
              evolution of open and close magnetic field regions. This information will be
              posted on a real time updated web site and delivered to the NOAA/Space
              Environment Center website. This effort will be essential for understanding the
              impacts of active region emergence and fragmentation on the evolution of the
              large-scale coronal magnetic field.
