Abstract    :
              

Through the Accentuating the Integration of Mathematics and Science (AIMS)
              program, Fayetteville State University will evaluate variables that contribute
              to low graduation rates and the steady decline of underrepresented minorities
              majoring in the mathematics and science fields.  Comprehensive approaches will
              be developed to enhance student performance and progress in mathematics,
              computer science, chemistry, physics, and biology. 

The infrastructure
              enhancement plan will include the following components:
(1) mathematics and
              science curriculum reform, improvement of gateway courses, and research
              training; (2) strengthening partnerships with industry, government, and other
              academic institutions to enhance the development of research programs on
              campus; (3) faculty development focusing on teaching/learning models,
              instructional delivery and assessment; and,
(3) evaluation and dissemination
              of project outcomes and best practices.
