BAC libraries for key branches of the flowering plant
              family tree will greatly accelerate progress in unraveling the 200-million year
              history of angiosperm evolution.  Extensive prior investments in the Poales and
              Brassicales make them important nucleation points for the monocots and dicots,
              respectively, from which to reach out across plant diversity to further
              investigate evolution of genome size, gene repertoire and function, and plant
              morphology.  We will make 5 libraries totaling 423,936 BACs from
              carefully-selected angiosperm genomes (see below) to empower new investigations
              of well-delineated questions in developmental, evolutionary, and comparative
              biology.  Among these, two (Ananas, Opuntia) will be the first BAC libraries
              known in their taxonomic orders, and two will be the first for important genome
              types (A, F) within a species complex (Gossypium) that is especially facile for
              asking fundamental questions about morphological transformations, polyploid
              evolution, and genome organization

These libraries will empower new
              investigations in monocots and dicots respectively, of general mechanisms
              associated with plant diversification, and the specific events that may account
              for major morphological-developmental transformations, by virtue of making
              possible important new comparisons to many taxa already well studied.  These
              libraries will also offer opportunities to shed new light on the genomic
              consequences of polyploidy, and new insights into the developmental genetics of
              other scientifically important features that are inadequately studied at the
              molecular level.  All of the taxa we will study are closely-related to
              economically-significant crops that exhibit features 'amplified' by human
              selection, and as such comprise botanical models in their own right for various
              aspects of plant growth and development.

This work will empower many
              scientific synergies to be realized by links with prior investments by the
              Arabidopsis and Rice Genome Initiatives, NSF Plant Genome Program (in the
              Poales and Malvales), USDA-IFAFS (in the Brassicales), and USDA-NRI genome
              programs (Malvales).  Community involvement in decisions relating to this
              project has been substantial.  Our research is closely-tied to strong training
              and outreach programs with a successful history of engaging undergraduates and
              groups under-represented in the sciences.
