Abstract    :
              This project sets out an agenda to study in detail three key operators designed
              for adaptivity in query processing: Eddies serve to do continuous, adaptive
              reordering of operators in query plans in the face of changing data statistics
              and system behavior.  SteMs expose the state management inherent in query
              processing as a first class operator in a physical algebra, allowing for
              adaptive competition and hybridization among query processing alternatives.
              FLuXen provide adaptive load balancing and fault tolerance across parallel
              machines. Using the Telegraph system infrastructure, this proposal's agenda is
              to investigate mechanisms and policies for efficient, robust eddies, SteMs and
              FluXen in the context of traditional and new query processing challenges. The
              end goal is to provide a parallel query processing architecture that can run
              nearly as well in perfect circumstances as a traditiona architecture, and --
              more importantly -- that can automatically adapt to run efficiently and
              robustly when faced with the kinds of imperfections and variations commonly
              seen in large-scale environments.
