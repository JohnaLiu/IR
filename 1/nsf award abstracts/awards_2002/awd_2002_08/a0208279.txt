Abstract    :
              "Frontiers of Plant Cell Biology: Signals and Pathways," the 22nd Symposium in
              Plant Biology at the University of California, Riverside (UCR), will be held
              January 15-19, 2003. The organizers are Natasha V. Raikhel and Zhenbiao Yang,
              Center for Plant Cell Biology in the Genomics Institute and the Department of
              Botany and Plant Sciences at UCR. Sequencing of the Arabidopsis and rice
              genomes has created new research directions, experimental approaches, and
              opportunities. Researchers are on the brink of elucidating the function of all
              the genes of Arabidopsis and other selected plant species. These exciting
              advances in plant biology are starting to reveal the molecular mechanisms
              underlying the functional properties of plant cells. Integrated genetic,
              genomic and biochemical approaches have led to the identification of signal
              transduction pathways, signal receptors, and biosynthetic pathways for inter-
              and intra-cellular communication; patch clamp studies have uncovered novel
              channels involved in cellular signaling; the structure and function of complex
              cell walls are being elucidated at an unprecedented pace; and more is being
              revealed about the machinery involved in targeting proteins to specific
              cellular locations. The aim of this symposium is to bring together students and
              scientists studying the plant cell from different perspectives genomic,
              bioinformatic, genetic, molecular, biochemical, and cell biological to
              highlight these recent advances and evaluate emerging approaches for the
              dissection of plant cell function at the molecular level. This is a rapidly
              developing area of plant science with abundant opportunity for young
              researchers to learn and contribute. The timing is ideal for a symposium that
              examines the functioning of the whole plant cell. This symposium will be
              distinct from others in the plant field because its small size is conducive to
              interaction among participants; such exchanges will likely lead to national and
              international collaborations. There will be approximately 200 attendees.
