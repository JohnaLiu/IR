Abstract    :
              
Energy is becoming the limiting resource for many applications, as processor
              performance and network bandwidth continue to rapidly advance.  Devices such as
              wireless sensor networks, cell phones with integrated personal organizers
              (PDAs), laptops, and even Internet hosting centers are all concerned about
              power consumption either due to limited battery capacity or the high cost of
              operating and cooling large server farms.  In many of these systems main memory
              can become a significant portion of the overall power budget, particularly with
              the advent of low-power, high-performance processors.

This project
              investigates main memory power management research issues that span several
              levels of computer system design: from the operating system managing memory
              power states, to the design characteristics of platform architectures, and
              finally down to the details of internal DRAM organization.
This project will
              investigate power management design decisions within each system level and
              explore interactions across levels.
