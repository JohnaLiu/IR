Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to improve estimates of the high latitude
              electrodynamic forcing of the thermosphere through quantification of variable
              electric fields and auroral precipitation, and through analysis of their
              influences on the thermosphere and on ionospheric currents.  The PIs propose to
              construct an empirical model of high-latitude electric fields and auroral
              precipitation that includes both average and variable components, and that
              quantifies magnitudes, coherences, and the correlation between the field and
              the precipitation.  Data will come from the Dynamics Explorer-2 (DE-2)
              spacecraft and from incoherent scatter radars.  The PIs will validate this new
              model by using it as input to the NCAR Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics
              General Circulation Model (TIE-GCM) and comparing their results with
              high-latitude observations of ground magnetic variations and neutral
              thermospheric winds and temperatures, including both mean values and standard
              deviations.
