Abstract    :
              The thrust of this collaborative project is to design, analyze and implement
              efficient algorithms for several tiling, packing and covering problems with
              rectangles in two or higher dimensions with applications in diverse areas such
              as: VLSI, computer graphics, image processing, database design, data mining and
              computational biology.  Since computing exact solutions for almost all of these
              problems is provably hard, the goal is to use diverse unifying techniques of
              algorithm design such as local-ratio, multi-phase methods, and slice-and-dice
              methods, and linear programming with nontrivial rounding and primal-dual
              schema.  They will develop novel data structures on grids for efficient
              approximation algorithms for these problems.
