Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Structural studies on Cdc42Hs
              mutant proteins that may initiate cellular transformation."  NMR spectroscopy
              is being used to characterize mutant forms of Cdc42Hs, an intracellular signal
              transduction protein cloned in E. coli. This protein binds GTP or GDP and acts
              as a molecular timing switch based on the nature of the bound ligand. The
              research will determine the structure and dynamics of two Cdc42Hs mutants to
              understand the role of Cdc42Hs in processes that lead to cell transformation.
