Abstract    :
              The demand for real-time data services has been increasing recently, as many
              real-time applications are becoming sophisticated in their data needs. A
              real-time database, a core component of many information services for real-time
              applications, can be a main service bottleneck. Current databases are not
              time-cognizant, are poor in supporting temporal consistency of real-time data
              and real-time execution of transactions, and therefore they do not perform well
              in these applications. To address this problem, a scheme for QoS management for
              real-time data services is proposed that provides guarantees on transaction
              timeliness and data freshness, which are considered two key performance metrics
              for real-time data services. The fundamental premise motivating this research
              is the need for real-time data service systems that are autonomous,
              data-intensive, and operable in unpredictable environments. The novel idea of
              using feedback control based QoS management to provide robust performance
              guarantees against unpredictable workload, incomplete knowledge, and load
              disturbances will be pursued. The scheme will be evaluated to validate the
              contributions using simulation. Success of this research would benefit an ever
              increasing set of applications, including several national critical
              infrastructures, that require real-time data services.
