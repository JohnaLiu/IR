Abstract    :
              Integrating humans with their naturally developed control algorithm and robots
              with their extended capability of applying forces and torques into one system
              offers multiple opportunities for creating a new generation of assistance
              technology for both healthy and disabled people suffering from neuromuscular
              diseases and neuro-degenerative disorders. The exoskeleton is a wearable
              robotic arm. It is worn by the human as an orthotic device and acts as a
              human-amplifier allowing the operator natural control of the device as an
              extension of his/her body while sharing an external load. One of the primary
              innovative ideas of this research is to set the human machine interface at the
              muscular level of the human physiological hierarchy using an expression of
              body's own control command (surface electromyography - sEMG) signals as one of
              the primary command signals of the exoskeleton for improving the synergy
              between the operator and the exoskeleton. The goals of this research are to
              design, build, and experimentally study the integration of a powered
              exoskeleton controlled by myosignals (sEMG) for the human arm with healthy
              people. It is anticipated that the scientific activity involved in this
              research will integrate and fuse multidisciplinary knowledge by promoting
              dialogues and collaborative work between students and faculty members from
              different disciplines with a long-term goal of improving the quality of life of
              the physically disabled community.
