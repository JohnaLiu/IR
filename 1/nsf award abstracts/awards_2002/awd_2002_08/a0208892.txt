Abstract    :
              Conditional branches are expensive.  Branches require a significant
percentage
              of the execution cycles since they occur frequently and can
cause pipeline
              stalls.  In addition, branches result in forks in the
control flow, which can
              prevent other code-improving transformations
from being applied.  We plan to
              develop path profile-based techniques
for replacing the execution of a set of
              two or more branches with a
single branch on a conventional scalar processor. 
              We propose to
improve performance by merging the conditions of two or more
              branches
into a single condition.  Previous approaches have accomplished
such
              merging of conditions that have either only involved a single
variable or have
              required special hardware to merge multiple
conditions together.  Techniques
              will be developed to produce a merged
condition involving multiple variables
              that can be used to bypass the
code testing the original set of conditions on
              a conventional processor.
Merging conditions may be very good fit for run-time
              optimization
systems, which optimize frequently executed paths during the
              execution
of a program.
