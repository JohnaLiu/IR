Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "The role of the cerebellum in
              learning the proper timing and amplitude of skilled motor movements."  The
              specific role of the cerebellum in learning motor movements is unclear.  This
              research examines motor learning in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), or VOR
              adaptation, of normal mice and PKCg mutant mice, which have abnormal input to
              cerebellar Purkinje cells.  It compares VOR adaptation, patterns of Purkinje
              cell activity during learning, and those sufficient for learning, in these
              mice.
