Abstract    :
              This project will analyze data from the Fast Auroral Snapshot Small Explorer
              (FAST) satellite in conjunction with solar wind data from the ACE and WIND
              spacecraft.  It will examine the processes that control the outflow of ions
              from the polar ionosphere.  In particular it will determine the relative
              importance of large scale Joule heating, Alfven wave heating and heating due to
              electron precipitation.  The work will produce a set of empirical scaling laws
              that can be used to parameterize ion outflow rates as a function of the various
              inputs.  It will also relate the outflow rates to the solar wind input
              parameters.
