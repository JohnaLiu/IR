Abstract    :
              A tomographic technique will be used to map solar wind structures, determine the
              extent of their interactions with the Earth, and locate their origins in the
              solar corona. The basic input data are interplanetary radio scintillation
              measurements supplied by the Solar Terrestrial Environment Laboratory of the
              Nagoya University (Japan). These are combined with a sophisticated numerical
              magnetohydrodynamic model of the heliosphere in order to reconstruct the
              trajectories of propagating interplanetary disturbances. This technique will be
              applied in real-time to ground and space-based data, and the results will be
              made available to the international community through the NOAA web-site. This
              study will allow the visualization of the extensive region between the Sun and
              the Earth with a novel level of completeness.
