Abstract    :
              This project aims at designing algorithms to infer 3-D models of the geometry
              (shape) and photometry (material) of objects from collections of images. Such
              algorithms are based on a representing visual scenes as dense surfaces, defined
              implicitly as functions of the measured images, and entail the numerical
              solution of partial differential equations. Our research aims at integrating in
              a unified analytical framework many ``shape from X'' algorithms for
              reconstructing spatial properties of a scene from images, including stereo,
              shape from shading, and shape from motion. Applications of the technology we
              plan to develop ranges from geology to medicine, manufacturing, security, to
              entertainment.
