Abstract    :
              The GRIDLOCK hypothesis is that use of a globally specified and locally
              interpreted policy language for specification of access-control policy can
              provide a new, unified approach to securing network applications. In
              particular, this approach can be used to specify network access-control
              policies and host access-control policies in combination to provide "virtual
              private services." GRIDLOCK simultaneously provides more security to
              applications, greater scalability, and unification of network access control
              and host access control. Policies are specified in a new policy-expression
              language, modeled on the KeyNote trust-management language.  This design
              supports compliance checking, with which credentials provided by a client can
              be validated to provide access to a resource.  The applicability of this
              layer-crossing approach to multiple virtual private services is
              investigated.

The research focuses on the development of formal semantics
              for the unified access-control policy, as well as a rigorous experimental
              investigation, using multiple example applications. The expected results
              include both the new policy-expression language and the demonstration that a
              scalable access-control model for networked applications is practical.
