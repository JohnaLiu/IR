Abstract    :
              Under the mentorship of  Dr. Ruth Peterson, the primary objective of this
              postdoctoral fellowship is to shed light on the differential consequences of
              incarceration at both the individual and community levels of analysis. At the
              individual level, the focus is on whether or not incarceration influences labor
              market outcomes for different racial and ethnic group members across contexts
              that vary in levels of segregation and social disadvantage. The interest in the
              impact of incarceration on the community is twofold: 1) to understand how the
              distribution of incarceration affects community organization and structure and
              2) to examine the consequences of incarceration for communities with different
              race/ethnic and class composition. The data selected for examining the
              consequences of incarceration at the individual level is the National
              Longitudinal Survey Youth 1979-1998 (NLSY). The basic modeling strategy will be
              to estimate three-level Hierarchical Linear Models (HLM) where level one is a
              person-year, level two is the person and level three is the spatial context of
              labor market conditions, disadvantage and segregation. The data for examining
              the consequences of incarceration at the neighborhood level will be drawn from
              the Ohio offender database maintained by the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation
              and Corrections and a neighborhood crime database for census tracts in Ohio
              cities being assembled by Professors Ruth Peterson and Lauren Krivo. The
              modeling strategy will be to estimate Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regressions
              for predominantly black, predominantly white and mixed census tracts.
