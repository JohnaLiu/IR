Abstract    :
              This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research by Professor Mahdi Abu-Omar of the University of California
              at Los Angeles to study the enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase from
              chromobacterium violaceum (cPAH).  A genetic deficiency in the homologous human
              enzyme, hPAH, is responsible for the disease phenylketonuria.  This research
              involves: 1) determining the rate-limiting step in the catalytic reaction of
              PAH by measuring 18O kinetic isotope effects;  2) trapping and characterizing
              intermediates involved in oxygen activation in PAH by kinetic and spectroscopic
              methods; 3) understanding the active site architecture and the origin of the
              substrate selectivity through site-specific mutants of the enzyme; and 4)
              establishing structure-function relationships by creating and exploring the
              reactivity of new PAH chimera composed of the regulatory domain of hPAH and the
              catalytic domain of cPAH.

The function of an important enzyme, phenylalanine
              hydroxylase, which synthesizes an essential amino acid, tyrosine that is
              further metabolized to important neurotransmitters will be studied.  The work
              will focus on how oxygen is activated at its iron-containing active site.
