Abstract    :
              This project will use subjectivity analysis to improve the accuracy of
              information extraction (IE) systems.  IE systems are designed to extract facts,
              but they are prone to false hits from subjective statements such as
              accusations, allegations, suspicions, and opinions. The first phase of the
              research will create a subjectivity classifier that uses learning algorithms to
              identify linguistic features associated with subjective language.  The
              classifier will use several natural language representations, including
              extraction patterns, N-grams, and noun phrases. The classifier will be embedded
              in a bootstrapping architecture so that it can learn from unannotated corpora,
              requiring only a small amount of annotated data to jumpstart the bootstrapping.
               In the second phase, the classifier will be integrated into an IE system to
              measure the impact of subjectivity classification on IE performance. 
              Information extracted from objective sentences will be treated as facts, but
              information extracted from subjective sentences will be labeled as uncertain or
              discarded.  This research will produce a better understanding of how subjective
              language is expressed and the role that context plays in recognizing
              subjectivity.  The potential impact of the research is to produce more accurate
              subjectivity classifiers and to demonstrate that subjectivity analysis can
              improve the performance of IE systems.
