Abstract    :
              This project investigates spoken language systems for the elderly and non-native
              speakers of English. Existing systems have been constructed for the average
              user and thus perform poorly for these nontraditional populations. The elderly
              have little access at present to computerized information, yet they have
              telephones that would enable them to access computers easily if the information
              were presented in a way that they could readily understand.  Non-native
              speakers have difficulty being understood by the same dialogue systems, which
              need to be adapted to their speech and aid them in finding the correct way to
              express themselves.  In order to improve the understandability of spoken
              output, Let's Go will investigate differences in lexical, prosodic and spectral
              content to enable elderly and non-native listeners to better understand the
              message.  In order to improve spoken input, the project will explore adaptation
              of the statistical models of the lexical and acoustic information of the
              incoming speech signal for the target populations.   Let's Go will assess the
              pertinence of its findings by creating a spoken language demonstrator that
              allows elderly and non-native users to access Port Authority Transit Bus
              information over the telephone.
