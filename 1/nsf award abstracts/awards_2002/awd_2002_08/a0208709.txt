Abstract    :
              Information theory has enjoyed over fifty years of rigorous
              research,
development, and application.
In spite of its relative
              maturity,
new challenges arise due to novel  applications and emerging
              theoretical
developments (e.g., there is a resurgence of interest in
              source
coding in multimedia applications, molecular biology, and
              security).
In the 1997 Shannon  Lecture Jacob Ziv
presented compelling
              arguments for ``backing off'' to a certain extent
from first-order asymptotic
              analysis of information
systems in order to predict the behavior of real
              systems with
finite (and often small) lengths (of sequences, files,
              codes,
databases, etc.) One way of overcoming these difficulties is
              to
increase accuracy of asymptotic analysis by replacing first-order
analyses
              (e.g., a leading term of the average code length)
by full asymptotic
              expansions and more
accurate analyses (e.g., large deviations, central limit
              laws).

This research primarily focuses on an important aspect of
source
              coding, namely, the redundancy rate problem.
Recent years have seen a
              resurgence of interest in
redundancy rates of lossless and lossy coding.
We
              describe analytic, combinatorial and algorithmic methods that
work hand in
              hand to solve this and other problems in information theory.
The redundancy
              rate problem for
a class of sources corresponds to determining the extent to
              which
the actual code length exceeds the optimal code length.
This problem is
              an ideal candidate
for second-order asymptotics
since one must look beyond
              the leading term of the code length,
which is known to be the entropy of the
              source.
Following Hadamard's precept we study these problems using
techniques
              of complex analysis such as generating functions,
Rice's formula, Mellin
              transform, Fourier series,
sequence distributed modulo 1, saddle point
              methods,
analytic poissonization and depoissonization, and
singularity
              analysis.  We present new results for
well-studied problems (e.g., optimal
              codes for maximal redundancy,
memoryless and Markovian sources) as well as
              novel formulations of old problems
(e.g., redundancy of the class of mixing
              sources, redundancy of
arithmetic coding and the Lemepl-Ziv codes).
              Furthermore,
we apply the techniques developed as a part of this study
to
              related problems such as prediction (based on pattern matching),
random number
              generators, the average worst case probability of
undetected error in channel
              coding, pattern matching approach to
(exact and approximate) run length
              coding, and others.
