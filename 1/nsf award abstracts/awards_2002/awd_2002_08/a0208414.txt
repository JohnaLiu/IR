Abstract    :
              This study will combine solar images derived from SOHO/LASCO and EIT and in-situ
              solar wind observations of interplanetary shocks with magnetohydrodynamic
              simulations of the global characteristics of the shock. From this synthesis one
              may derive information on the shock source location with respect to the Earth,
              the size of the coronal mass ejection, the shock compression parameters and
              characteristics of the magnetized plasma flow at its in situ observation at 1
              AU. This information will be used to identify the effect on the level of solar
              energetic particles at shock passage at 1 AU. As a result of this analysis, it
              should thus be possible to develop a better forecast capability for radiation
              levels at Earth than what is currently available through the NOAA space weather
              service.
