Abstract    :
              Determining the speeds of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) is very important for
              determining when a CME on the solar disk will impact the Earth.  The head-on
              speed of a CME is very difficult to measure directly and this project will
              investigate the possibility of using measurements of the associated filaments
              to determine the speed of the CME.  Observations in the Helium I (HeI) emission
              at 1032 nm will be used for this purpose.  The data will be obtained from the
              Mauna Loa Solar Observatory.  The HeI 1083 nm data will then be compared with
              data from the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph Experiment (LASCO) on the
              SOHO satellite.  In addition, the project will use magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
              simulations of the propagation of CMEs to help refine the predicted Earth
              impact times.
