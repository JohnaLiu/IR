Abstract    :
              
This research is focused on developing circuits and architectures for
              asynchronous high-performance computers.  Asynchronous organization has a
              number of significant advantages over the traditional globally synchronous
              approach that we plan to exploit.  These advantages can be broken down into two
              general categories: those that relate to the circuit-level properties of
              asynchronous circuits, and those that relate to the higher-level sequential
              properties of this form of implementation. Circuit advantages, which are mostly
              directly related to the absence of the global clock signal, include lower
              electro-magnetic interference (EMI), lower power, and easier system integration
              due to the local and modular interconnection of asynchronous system pieces. 
              Higher-level organizational advantages
include the ability of an asynchronous
              system to adapt to data-dependent delays in system components, take advantage
              of early completion of system activities, and more naturally mediate
              sub-task
concurrency during system operation.
