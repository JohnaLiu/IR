Abstract    :
              Recent advances in microbiology such as cloning demonstrate that increasingly
              complex micromanipulation strategies for manipulating individual biological
              cells are required. From a robotics standpoint, the manipulation of biological
              cells presents several interesting research issues which extend well beyond
              biomanipulation. Biological cells are highly deformable objects, and the
              material properties of these objects are not well quantified, so developing
              strategies for manipulating deformable objects must be addressed. Most
              biological cells are between 1 and 100 microns in diameter, depending on the
              cell type, so micromanipulation issues must be explored, including the
              appropriate use of high resolution, low depth-of-field vision feedback and very
              low magnitude force feedback. Although multi-axis force sensing capabilities
              would be useful for handling cells by providing information on injection forces
              as well as tangential forces generated by improperly aligned cell probes, no
              sensors capable of multi-axis force sensing at the force scales required are
              available. Robotic devices capable of complex manipulation of biological cells
              do not exist, and robotic systems capable of integrating a variety of novel
              sensory information for cell manipulation have not been created. By pursing
              robotic manipulation of biological cells, many interesting robotics research
              avenues in micromanipulation, deformable object handling, multi-sensor
              integration, and force and vision feedback assimilation must be explored. In
              this project, an autonomous microrobotic system capable of manipulating
              individual biological cells using real-time vision and force feedback is being
              developed, and the micromanipulation of deformable biological cells are being
              investigated.
