Abstract    :
              The research goals of this project are (1) to determine how the
              metacognitively-focused instructional tool called the
              Model-Observe-Reflect-Explain (MORE) Thinking Frame can be used in both high
              school and college chemistry laboratory courses to enhance metacognition,
              understanding, and problem solving, (2) to investigate how instructor
              professional development experiences can be designed to sustain the effective
              use of the MORE Thinking Frame, as well as specifically what instructors learn
              from such experiences, and (3) to augment and refine the model of how people
              use their metacognitive skills in the contexts of chemistry learning, problem
              solving, and instructor professional development. Design experiments will be
              employed to study the complex and dynamic interplay between instructor and
              student cognition (understanding, beliefs, metacognition); instructor
              professional development experiences; and classroom practices of communities of
              learners using the MORE Thinking Frame as instructional and professional
              development designs are simultaneously refined.  Throughout the course of the
              project, a sequence of instructional and curricular developments that centrally
              involve the Model-Observe-Reflect-Explain (MORE) Thinking Frame will be
              implemented, studied, and refined.  During the first year of the project, high
              school and college instructors will collaborate with the developers of the MORE
              Thinking Frame to learn about, adapt, and implement the MORE Frame in their own
              laboratory courses (without changing the experiments used in their existing
              curricula). In the second and third years of the project, the project team
              (including many of these instructors) will design problem-based laboratory
              modules to complement the use of the MORE Thinking Frame and to infuse more
              authentic inquiry into the chemistry laboratory courses.

Throughout the
              professional development experiences and successive implementations of the MORE
              Frame in various instructors' classrooms, data will be collected from a broad
              range of sources (both qualitative and quantitative) and analyzed to address
              the research questions and to inform future practice. In addition, a website
              will be constructed to provide information and support for implementing MORE
              curricula and instruction as well as to provide instructional materials for the
              problem-based modules developed. Finally, the project team will conduct
              workshops to disseminate information and materials.  This project will generate
              new knowledge about how metacognitively-focused instructional tools can be used
              to enhance students' science learning in various instructional contexts; how to
              structure effective professional development experiences and what instructors
              learn from such experiences; how laboratory teaching practices are linked to
              students' chemistry learning; and the relationships among metacognition,
              chemistry teaching, and chemistry learning.
