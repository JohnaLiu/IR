Abstract    :
              This program was enacted by Congress and is administered by the Department of
              Energy, Office of Science, with participation from the National Aeronautics and
              Space Administration and the National Institutes of Health.  It provides an
              opportunity for current public or private elementary and secondary mathematics,
              technology, and science classroom teachers with demonstrated excellence in
              teaching an opportunity to serve in the national public policy arena.  Fellows
              provide practical insight in establishing and operating education programs. 
              Albert Einstein Fellows bring to congress and appropriate branches of the
              federal government the extensive knowledge and experience of classroom
              teachers.  They provide practical insights and "real world" perspectives to
              policy makers and program managers developing or managing educational programs.
