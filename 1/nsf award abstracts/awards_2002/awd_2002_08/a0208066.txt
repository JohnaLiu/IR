Abstract    :
              The Learning Research and Development Center at the University of Pittsburgh
              will conduct a longitudinal study in which researchers will create a three-year
              sequence of model-centered instruction in the context of the Model-Assisted
              Reasoning in Science (MARS).  MARS current topics will be extended from sixth
              through eighth grades.  The project seeks to: (1) understand how working
              external models support content and process learning, (2) develop an evaluation
              model to tap strengths and weaknesses of different kinds of external models,
              and (3) identify pedagogical strategies that elicit and support model-assisted
              reasoning.  Student content knowledge and process skills will be measured
              through different test formats that include paper-and-pencil (TIMSS, NAEP, and
              Test of Scientific Reasoning items), written tests, class work, and classroom
              computer exercises.  Student motivation will be measured at the beginning of
              each year.  A small sample of students will be interviewed and given some
              transfer tasks twice a year.  Interviews will focus on two aspects: properties
              of the different model types and student's metacognitive understanding of the
              function of models in science.  Information on classroom implementation will be
              collected by direct observation, videotapes, and interviews with teachers. 
              Results of the study are expected to help extend theories of model-based
              reasoning and its applicability in classrooms.
