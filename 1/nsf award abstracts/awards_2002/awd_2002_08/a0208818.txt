Abstract    :
              Efforts are underway worldwide to create Web-accessible mathematical and
              scientific digital libraries. To leverage such resources, users should be able
              to search not only for text, but also for equations, formulas and other math
              constructs.

This project will develop the theory and algorithms for indexing
              and searching of mathematical expressions, and implement a Web-accessible math
              search and retrieval system. Also, the project will define and implement a math
              query language that is intuitive and expressive. This will allow users to enter
              full or fragmentary mathematical expressions as queries, and retrieve all
              documents containing the symbolic entities that match the query, even if those
              entities are represented graphically (e.g., GIF images). The methodology is to
              build a math search engine on top of a text search engine, and to translate
              math contents and queries into textual queries by means of novel textualization
              and structure-linearization-&-normalization techniques. A more powerful but
              demanding alternative strategy, structural indexing, will be developed in a
              follow-up project.

This unprecedented search capability will provide
              educators and students, from junior high schools to graduate schools, with an
              effective knowledge-discovery tool to enhance learning and problem-solving
              skills in mathematics and mathematical sciences. It will also be a valuable aid
              to researchers and practitioners in those fields.
