Abstract    :
              As part of this project, densities and cross-track (quasi-zonal) winds at
              400-450 km will be derived from accelerometer measurements by the STAR
              accelerometer experiment on the CHAMP and GRACE satellites from 2000 through
              2004.  On a storm-by-storm basis, the magnitude of storm response, degree of
              equatorward penetration, time delays, and other characteristics of the density
              perturbations will be examined, interpreted and compared with predictions by
              empirical models.  Wind patterns will also be derived and interpreted.  The
              full data set will be deposited in the CEDAR database.  Corrections will be
              made to the J70 model currently in use at NORAD, so as to better reproduce the
              observed density perturbations.
