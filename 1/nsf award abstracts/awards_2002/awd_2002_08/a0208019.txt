In most models of Cascadia subduction, lithology and
              heat flow models constrain the downdip extent of coupling between the
              subducting and overriding plates. Recent seismological studies suggest that
              some of the previous assumptions made regarding lithology may be unjustified. A
              preliminary model suggests that active surface deformation can be the result of
              deep coupling in addition to the shallow region that is indicated by currently
              accepted models. An exploratory model is being developed that tests the
              hypothesis that the Cascadia subduction zone is locked deeper than currently
              thought.  Traditional two dimensional dislocation modeling is being employed as
              a first step, possibly followed by more advanced models.

Three seismic
              hazards pose a threat to western Oregon and Washington state: large megathrust
              earthquakes; moderate size earthquakes on crustal faults; and large intraplate
              earthquakes within the subducted slab. All three of these hazards may be
              influenced by the location and extent of coupling between the subducting Juan
              de Fuca and overriding North America plates. Reducing the uncertainty regarding
              the downdip limit of this locked region will allow for better assessment of the
              potential for damaging earthquakes near the highly populated urban areas of the
              Pacific Northwest.
