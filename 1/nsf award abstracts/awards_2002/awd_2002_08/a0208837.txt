Abstract    :
              The Year 2002 Technical Activities Program was formulated by the Federal

              committees and the senior representatives of the sponsor agencies (Attachment
              3). The proposed program supports:

Conducting a two-day workshop on
              "Barriers and Incentives for Implementing Health-Protective Features and
              Practices in Indoor Workplaces" in accordance with the procedures of the
              National Research Council.
Formulating and publishing one information study on
              contracting and acquisition strategies and related issues.
Convening a one-day
              conference on physical security issues.
Convening a one-day forum focused on
              the future role of the federal government as an owner of facilities.
Convening
              two, one half-day government/industry forums on specific topics to be
              determined by the FFC.
Providing administrative and technical support for the
              FFC and its standing committees. This includes support for up to 35 committee
              meetings with guest speakers, maintaining and enhancing networking activities
              through the FFC Web site, and participating in industry conferences and
