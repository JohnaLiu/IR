This two-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in
              embedded and hybrid computer systems involves Rajesh K. Gupta and Sandeep K.
              Shukla of the University of California, Irvine, Jean-Pierre Talpin and Paul Le
              Guernic of the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and
              Engineering (INRIA) in Rennes (IRISA).  The research is aimed at enabling C++
              based design paradigms, a software programming language which can be used in
              object-oriented programming language IC systems and system on a chip (SOC)
              designs.  The research addresses development of C++ usage, which is
              "semantically clean" and can be used in high-level hardware systems. This
              requires semantics that matches across compilers, high-level synthesis tools
              and simulated behavior of C++ design.  The approach combines an unambiguous
              semantic framework named BDL (backbone description language) developed by
              researchers at IRISA and a split-level programming paradigm developed by the
              Irvine group. 

This award represents the U.S. side of a joint proposal to
              the NSF and INRIA.  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses of the U.S.
              investigators and graduate students.  INRIA will support the French
              researchers' visits to the United States. The U.S. and French teams represent
              expertise in software programming languages, hardware description languages,
              and formal semantics.
