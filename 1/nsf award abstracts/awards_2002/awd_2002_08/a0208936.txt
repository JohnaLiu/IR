Abstract    :
              The project aims at developing an evaluation methodology for content-based
              
image retrieval. The research involves: (1) Measurement of the complexity of
              
image testbeds which can be used to quantitatively determine the degree of
              
difficulty in retrieving images from the image testbeds, and (2) Comparison
              
of the performance of different retrieval approaches which can quantitatively
              
give an objective ranking of the performance of the retrieval approaches.
              
The project designs a general framework of image feature representations
              
which can be used as a vehicle to conduct statistical analysis on images and
              
forms a basis for establishing the evaluation methodology. Using this
              framework,
the evaluation method can measure the complexity of the image
              databases by 
their cross entropy and rank the retrieval approaches by their
              cross entropy 
with respect to a particular testbed. The image testbeds can
              thus be compared 
with each other on their complexity in supporting image
              querying. Furthermore, 
the retrieval techniques can be compared with each
              other without using queries 
so the human subjectivity is avoided. The
              algorithms developed in this project 
will be a valuable asset for the
              community to eventually establish a general 
theory of the evaluation
              methodology for content-based image retrieval research.
