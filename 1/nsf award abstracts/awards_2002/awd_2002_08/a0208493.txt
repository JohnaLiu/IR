This is a project to provide management and support for
              selected scientific activities associated with a pilot hole to be drilled at
              the site of the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD).  SAFOD is a
              component of EarthScope.  The SAFOD pilot hole is a separate, 2 km deep
              scientific drilling experiment to be carried out at the same surface location
              as SAFOD. This site is ~1.8 km SW of the San Andreas fault near Parkfield, CA. 
              The pilot hole project will be carried out as a collaborative effort between
              the International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP), NSF, and the US
              Geological Survey.  The ICDP has made available $1.5M to pay the costs for
              drilling, coring, logging and other rig-related activities.  NSF is providing
              support for science activities involving core and cuttings and measurements of
              various kinds in the hole.
