Abstract    :
              Dynamic maneuvers such as rapid starts, stops, and changes of directions are
              important behaviors for many mammals in high-speed pursuit or flight
              situations.  In this project we will study these maneuvers by means of a
              combination of theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experiment using
              robotic galloping machines.  The focus of the work will be on non-repetitive
              maneuvers, as opposed to the cyclic motions that occur when galloping or
              trotting.  An impulse-momentum model, combined with ballistic trajectories,
              will be used as the basis for our theoretical analysis.  Evolutionary robotics
              strategies, including genetic algorithms, will be used in  combination with
              high-speed dynamic simulation to evolve the dynamic maneuvers.  We will design
              and build a relatively small experimental galloping machine to further
              investigate the dynamics of such systems.
