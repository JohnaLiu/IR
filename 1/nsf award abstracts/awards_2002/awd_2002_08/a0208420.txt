Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002.
              The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of
              scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the
              fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest
              quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to
              increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority
              groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific
              enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will
              play important roles in training of the future workforce.

The research and
              training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Role of antagonistic coevolution
              in the rate of male accessory gland protein divergence."  Within a mating
              system, males and females often have divergent reproductive strategies,
              creating an antagonistic coevolutionary relationship between the sexes. The
              objective of this research is to investigate the covariance between sexual
              conflict intensity and the expression of sexually selected traits, life history
              traits and the rate of protein divergence in closely related Drosophila
              species.
