Abstract    :
              The next generation of computers will be multi-threaded,
allowing the
              simultaneous execution of several programs.
Most computer workloads are
              difficult to recast into
multi-threaded form, under-utilizing multi-threading
              capabilities.

This research studies a new approach to program
              translation:
Assist Threads.

An assist thread is a specialized version of
              an application program that,
when run as an independent thread, assists (and
              optimizes) the application.
Roles for assist threads include program
              profiling, monitoring, pre-execution,
and memory management.

Experiments
              show that assist threads
can effectively implement garbage collection.
An
              assist thread mimics an application's execution,
tracking memory accesses and
              recycling unused memory as it is recognized.
The main application thread
              ignores memory management concerns,
becoming simpler, faster and more
              reliable.

Other varieties of assist threads execute slightly in advance of
              an
application program, precomputing and preloading needed data
              values.

This research makes both theoretical and practical contributions
              to
compiler technology. It explores how to generate the
              computations
necessary to implement assist threads. It also experiments with a
              variety
of assist threads, evaluating their effectiveness and
              efficiency.

In summary, this research opens new avenues of application for
              multi-threaded
processors, making them more effective in supporting the needs
              of a wide
variety of computer users.
