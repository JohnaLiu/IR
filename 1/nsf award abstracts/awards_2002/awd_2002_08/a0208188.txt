Abstract    :
              The proposed research project builds on the previously demonstrated capability
              to retrieve O/N2 column density ratios from Far Ultraviolet (FUV) images
              obtained from the DE 1 satellite and the resulting demonstration of the
              correlation between large "clouds" of reduced O/N2 and reduced Nmax observed by
              ground based ionosondes.  The proposed research will carry this program forward
              by making use of additional ionospheric data, specifically, topside soundings
              obtained from the ISIS 1 and 2 satellites, incoherent scatter radar (ISR) data,
              and satellite in situ data during 1981 and 1982.  By providing topside electron
              density profiles during negative ionospheric storms, these data will constrain
              ionospheric and thermospheric models and allow the estimation of neutral
              density profiles during these events.  The ultimate goal of the research
              program is to improve and enhance the ability to model thermospheric and
              ionospheric behavior during geomagnetic storms, and to increase the
              understanding of the impact of geomagnetic storms on the midlatitude
              thermosphere and ionosphere.
