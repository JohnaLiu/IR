Abstract    :
              Progress in the field of natural language processing (NLP) is currently limited,
              at least in part, by the speed with which new annotated corpora can be created.
              In addition, there is evidence that achieving the next level of performance in
              automated text understanding will require annotated training corpora that are
              orders of magnitude larger than those currently available. In short, there
              exists a corpus annotation bottleneck in building robust, accurate NLP system
              components. The PI proposes, therefore, to investigate machine learning
              paradigms that will significantly reduce human annotation costs while
              maintaining or improving the accuracy of the natural language learning
              algorithms that are trained on the acquired corpora. The project will (1) study
              the application of active learning (Cohn et al., 1994) and weakly supervised
              bootstrapping algorithms like co-training (Blum & Mitchell, 1998) on a set of
              representative problems in natural language processing, (2) identify the
              benefits and limitations of these approaches for reducing the manual annotation
              burden during the creation of large training corpora for natural language
              learning, and (3) develop a cooperative learning framework (Pierce & Cardie,
              2002) that combines active and weakly supervised learning in an attempt to more
              effectively interleave manual and automated linguistic annotation
              efforts.
