Abstract    :
              This project will determine a well-defined set of rules for identifying periods
              of Steady Magnetospheric Convection (SMC).  An automated procedure will be
              established to go through a large database of satellite and ground-based data
              to identify SMC periods.  Once a database of SMC periods had been generated the
              project will then utilize that database to perform statistical analyses on the
              conditions under which SMCs arise.  If a clear set of solar wind and
              magnetospheric conditions can be identified as the generators of SMCs, an
              expert system will then be developed for making for detailed nowcasts and
              forecasts of space weather.
