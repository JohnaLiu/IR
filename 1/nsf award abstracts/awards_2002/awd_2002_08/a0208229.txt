Abstract    :
              This grant will host a two day workshop to investigate the current education
              programs and mission of Field Stations and Marine Laboratories and to develop
              recommendations on how this mission can be expanded. It is hoped that concerns
              on methods of increasing field biology in the undergraduate curriculum,
              increasing participation by underrepresented groups, collaborations with
              traditionally minority institutions, community colleges, and museums, and
              enhancing programs at field stations to cover all areas of biology will be
              addressed by the participants. Prior to the workshop, a survey will be
              conducted to assess the range and diversity of educational programs at field
              stations and marine labs. The outcome will be an oral presentation and paper
              and electronic brochures of the findings and discussions.
