Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT
What is the ``typical" traffic of a link? What constitutes ``abnormal"
              traffic, and therefore warrants an alert for suspicious behavior
              (intrusion)?
How will the Internet look like next year?  These are the
              questions that the project focuses on.

It has two major thrusts:
The first
              is to find patterns in the network traffic,  and the second is to find trends
              in the Internet evolution. The technical merit is  in the synergy of the
              networking and  data mining fields, pushing the envelope in both:
The
              networking field will enjoy novel insights and fast tools to predict the
              network performance.  The data mining field will benefit from new problems
and
              new tools (using fractals, power laws, large-graph algorithms),  that will be
              stress-tested on multiple Gigabytes of real, network data. 

The broader
              impact of this work will be a novel insight of the network behavior at the
              micro and macro level. In addition,  the work will explore our ability to
              predict the network behavior and its evolution. As a result, the work will
              provide new tools to identify abnormal behavior, that could be due to a
              security breach like a DDoS attack.
