Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to develop a novel framework to support
              more effective and secure content-based video access over large-scale database.
              Specifically, the framework includes: (a) a hierarchical video database
              management and indexing structure to define the contextual and logical
              relationships among the related visual concepts and thus facilitate more
              efficient video access; (b) a probabilistic semantic video classifier to bridge
              the semantic gap between the low-level visual features and the high-level
              visual concepts; (c) a hierarchical visual summarization and presentation
              technique to enable fast video browsing over IP networks; (d) a multi-level
              video database access control scheme to serve different classes of users and
              maintain the video data integrity and security.  A wide range of potential
              applications could benefit from this research, such as education and distance
              learning, health care and telemedicine, digital library, national security and
              defense, network-based media, and entertainment
