Abstract    :
              The general research goals will be to develop scheduling algorithms, to provide
              provable performance guarantees, and to explore lower bounds defining the
              limits of achievable performance.  The performance of an algorithm on a given
              instance will be evaluated by comparing the algorithm's achieved benefit to the
              maximum possible benfit which could have been achieved on the same instance. 
              The ratio between teh achievable benefit and the achieved benefit will be
              considered over an entire class of instances; the worst-case value of this
              ration is commonly called the competeitive ration of an algorithm.

The
              specific research goals will be two-fold.  The first direction of research will
              be to develop additional parameterization which can be used to describe the
              competitiveness of schedulers with finer granularity. The second goal is to
              better understand how subtle changes in the underlying modelaffect the
              achievable performance.
