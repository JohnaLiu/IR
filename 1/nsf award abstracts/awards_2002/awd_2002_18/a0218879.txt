              comprise the membership; the
United States is a key participant and strong
              supporter of IOC activities. The IOC develops and promotes international
              research to improve global undestanding of ocean processes and their
              relationship to the sustainable development and stewardship of ocean resoruces.
              This project consitutes the NSFportion of support to the Ocean Science Section
              of the IOC, including development of a new program on Multidisciplinary Science
              and Natural Resources and an international initiative to examine critical
              issues of land-atmosphere-ocean biogeochemistry.
