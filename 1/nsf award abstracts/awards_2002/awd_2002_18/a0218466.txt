Abstract    :
              Distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks have emerged as a prevalent way to
              take down web sites and have imposed financial losses to companies. The CSI/FBI
              survey (CSI 2001) shows that 36% of respondents in the last 12-months period
              have detected denial of service, which imposed more than $4.2 million financial
              losses. The effectiveness of DDOS defenses depends on many factors such that
              the nature of the network's topology, the specific attack scenario, and various
              
characteristics of the network routers. However, little research has focused
              on the tradeoffs inherent in this complex system. The researchers are
              developing a computational testbed to study security policies and the
              associated technologies that provide defenses against DDOS attacks.   The
              researchers are using this framework to evaluate various policies and
              technologies. Out model and the ensuing analyses are informed by research in
              the areas of computer science, information science, organizational theory and
              social networks.

There have been a number of proposals on how to control the
              on-going DDOS attack traffic. None have been widely deployed. The effectiveness
              of DDOS defenses depends on many factors, such as the type of network topology,
              the type of attacks and whether all ISPs are compliant in 
establishing
              defenses. However, little is known about the interactions among these factors.
              Knowing what tradeoffs will occur as these factors vary will enable
              stakeholders to make more informed security policy decisions in which they
              adjust for the chance that others may not make 
the same decisions. Our
              research illuminates these tradeoffs. Moreover, the computational model the
              researchers are building enables the user to examine the tradeoffs associated
              with various DDOS defenses and attack scenarios at the router level.

The
              researchers focus on two basic research questions. First, how do ISPs provide
              DDOS defenses at the lowest cost while their subscribers remain satisfied with
              the availability of network connections during attacks? A cost-performance
              analysis of the effectiveness of DDOS defenses is being conducted using results
              from the computational model. This cost-performance analysis will aid ISPs and
              local network administrators in their evaluation of DDOS defenses. Second, the
              researchers ask where are the critical points in a network to deploy defenses? 
              The researchers examine the impact of network topology on the deployment
              location of defenses. Graph level 
indices and models from social network
              studies will be used to categorize network topologies and to select deployment
              locations for defenses. This analysis will provide guidance to decision
              makers.

Benefits of this work research include: The policy framework the
              researchers are developing will help ISPs and subscribers to consider the
              benefits of providing DDOS defenses and to realize the tradeoffs in DDOS
              defenses. Results from this study will enable decision makers to make more
              
informed security policy decisions for computer networks. It is costly and
              unethical to conduct real world experiments of DDOS attacks on large networks.
              This research will provide a cost effective and ethical means for evaluating
              various attack scenarios and defenses. Further, topological measures developed
              in this research should be useful for studies of other large-scale topologies.
              As such, this work extends social network measures typically used on small
              person-to-person 
networks to large-scale computer networks. Finally, this
              research provides a theoretical basis for evaluating DDOS defenses building on
              interdisciplinary studies from the fields of computer science, 
information
              science, organizational theory and social network analysis.
