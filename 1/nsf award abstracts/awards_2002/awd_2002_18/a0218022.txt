This award supports 16 participants (nine from the United
              States and seven from Africa) in a US-Africa Workshop on "Integrated Land Use
              Change in Southern Africa: Process Modeling, Impacts, and Implications for
              Sustained Development," scheduled for July 8-12, 2002, in Zomba, Malawi.  The
              co-organizers are Professor Paul Desanker, with the Department of Environmental
              Sciences at the University of Virginia, and Professor Mzoma Ngulube, with the
              Faculty of Environmental Science at Mzuzu University, Malawi.  There will be a
              total of approximately 27 participants, who will be drawn from academia and
              governmental organizations in the United States, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania,
              South Africa, Lesotho, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.  The workshop will draw upon
              process studies of land cover-land use change (LCLUC) to advance the discussion
              of how the emerging field of sustainability science can inform and guide the
              sustained development of complex human-ecological systems.  The meeting is also
              expected to establish linkages between investigators in the United States and
              Africa for the development of collaborative, interdisciplinary research and
              education programs.

The way people use land is fundamental to the
              livelihoods, political stability, and economies of many countries, especially
              in Southern Africa where there is a heavy reliance on land-based economic
              activities.  And while the adverse impacts of land use are well known, they
              have not yet been well quantified.  Workshop participants will focus on better
              understanding the processes, rates, and modeling of land use change in Southern
              Africa, especially for the linked human-river basin-ecological systems within
              the greater Zambezi River Basin and its components, the Miombo biodiversity
              ecoregion, and Southern Africa in general.  The meeting will consist of plenary
              talks and small group discussions, and will also include site visits to examine
              ongoing projects within the Lake Malawi and Lake Chilwa basins.  It is expected
              that the results of the workshop will lead to a state-of-the art synthesis of
              land use change for the Zambezi region.  More broadly, the meeting's findings
              will inform the larger scientific community about integrating fundamental,
              multidisciplinary research studies on LCLUC into sustained development
              programs.  This information will also be useful to policy makers and resource
              managers.  Results will be disseminated through professional journals and
              meetings, and via a web site.

The project supports the participation of five
              junior investigators from the United States, as well as a postdoc and graduate
              student from Africa.

The Office of International Science and Engineering,
              the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences, and the Division of
              Environmental Biology jointly support this award.
