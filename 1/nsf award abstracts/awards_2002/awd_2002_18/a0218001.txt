Abstract    :
              The Coweeta LTER Research Program has evolved since 1980 from a site-based to a
              site- and region-based project examining the effects of disturbance and
              environmental gradients on biogeochemical cycling, and the underlying watershed
              ecosystem processes that regulate and respond to those cycles. The objective
              for the proposed 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific understanding of
              the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of land use and land-use
              change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the last 200 years, and
              forecast patterns into the future 30 years. This will be accomplished by
              addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of land-use change while
              continuing long-term studies of environmental gradients and natural disturbance
              regimes. The result will be a more complete understanding of ecological
              dynamics in the southern Appalachian Mountains that makes possible the
              development of reasonable forecasts of its future ecological state.

The
              guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity,
              and extent of land use represents human decision-making in response to
              socioeconomic and biogeophysical conditions with consequences that cascade
              through ecosystems. The research activities are organized into three
              initiatives: (1) characterization of the "socio-natural template," (2)
              ecosystem responses to the socio-natural template, and (3) forecasting
              ecosystem responses to changes in the socio-natural template. The integrated
              scientific research will provide both a description as well as an explanation
              of the underlying causes of land use and the consequences of land-use change
              for southern Appalachian ecosystems and society. It thus recognizes the
              complexity of land use as a process and the research and outreach needs as
              defined in the LTER Program and the broader scientific and public communities.
