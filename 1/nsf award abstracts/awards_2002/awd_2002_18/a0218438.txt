Abstract    :
              This is a SGER grant covering a period of twelve months.  The proposed tasks
              are:  

To explore different neutrino detector designs in the proposed
              Homestake/Yeats formation.

To work closely with manufacturers who are
              developing new photon detectors (PDs) so that the new PDs will be suitable for
              detecting neutrinos.  For example, they would supply specifications and check
              PDs for characteristics that are unique to neutrino detection, quantities such
              as: quantum efficiency as a function of wavelength, ability to stand pressure,
              longevity of the PDs, amount of intrinsic radioactive materials in the PDs,
              etc.
