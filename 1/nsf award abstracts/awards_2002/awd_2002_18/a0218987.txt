Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for investigators from Harvard and Northwestern
              Universities for an investigation of the creation and use of application
              signatures from the ATLAS high energy physics experiment, at the Large Hadron
              Collider (LHC) at CERN, Switzerland, as estimators for resource usage and
              adaptation for computing on a Grid. The experiment will be working with the
              largest data sets ever used in a physics experiment and will involve physicists
              distributed world wide. The access to these data and the analyses of them will
              require a grid network. Rather than just transfer the large data sets around
              the world, the scientists need to be able to regenerate the data by taking a
              limited signature of a specific data set, called an application signature, and
              invoke methods to cause a physical materialization.

The group proposes to
              develop application signatures for jobs in the ATLAS experiment; to develop
              tools to estimate the execution times required to complete computing tasks
              based on a limited set of application signatures; to use this information to
              help schedule tasks on a set of grid resources; to find the most efficient way
              to solve a particular ATLAS analysis problem; and to evaluate their results in
              terms of generalization to other applications.
