The spatio-temporal complexity and non-linear dynamics of
              coastal ocean flows will be studied using methods adapted from recent work on
              the non-linear dynamics of low-dimensional systems.  Stable and unstable
              periodic or approximately periodic solutions of a three-dimensional, numerical
              coastal ocean circulation model with realistic bottom topography and
              oscillatory atmospheric forcing will be computed and their dynamics analyzed. 
              The linear stability and disturbance growth properties of these solutions will
              be studied using Floquet theory, optimal disturbance, and Lyapunov vector
              analyses.  Applications toward ensemble forecasting methods for coastal ocean
              circulation will be explored.  This research is expected to yield substantial
              new insights into the nonlinear dynamics and inherent predictability of the
              coastal ocean system.
