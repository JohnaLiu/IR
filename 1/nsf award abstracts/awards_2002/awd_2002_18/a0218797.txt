Nader

This is an AWARE developmental visit proposed by Mr. Richard
              Nader, Texas A & M University to establish International Research Experience
              for Undergraduates (IREU)  sites in information technology, advanced materials,
              and geoscience in Taiwan. The purpose of this coordinated visit to Taiwan is to
              develop contacts and plans for developing a proposal for an international
              Research Experience for Undergraduates site based at the Texes A & M
              University, and involving the following universities in Taiwan: National Taiwan
              University, National Taiwan Ocean University, National Cheng Kung University,
              National Chiao Tung University, National Tsing Hua University and National Sun
              Yat Sen University.  Texas A & M is well positioned for a program of this type
              and it will advance the NSF objective of developing an internationally
              competitive and globally engaged U.S. science and engineering workforce.
