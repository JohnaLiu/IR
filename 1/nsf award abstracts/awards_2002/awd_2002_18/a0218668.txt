TITLE: Development of Force-Frequency Shifting for Low
              Frequency Structural Vibration Testing

Experimental vibration testing of
              civil and architectural systems is useful for addressing a number of issues
              including; assessment of structural health (degradation of bridges), and
              reduction of troublesome oscillatory motion in buildings for sensitive
              installations such as medical MRIs in hospitals and electron microscopes. The
              testing of these systems requires that a high amplitude force excitation be
              applied at very low frequencies (0.1 - 10 Hz), which is inherently very
              difficult to accomplish. The research program is focused on developing a new
              technique, referred to as Force Frequency Shifting (FFS), to provide such an
              excitation.  The FFS technique is based on the application of a high amplitude,
              high frequency force (at frequency fz) to a structure in a spatially time
              variant fashion (at frequency fx). The nonlinear dynamic behavior of the system
              produces an excitation at a sum and difference (fz+fx, and fz-fx) of the force
              and spatial motion frequencies. Of particular interest for low frequency
              vibration testing, is the difference frequency component (fz-fx). It is the
              innate ability of the FFS technique to create this low frequency component that
              is the focus of the project. The research will develop an FFS exciter with a
              computer-controlled array of variable stiffness actuators. This development
              will increase the low frequency force performance and control making the FFS
              suitable for vibration testing of the targeted systems.
