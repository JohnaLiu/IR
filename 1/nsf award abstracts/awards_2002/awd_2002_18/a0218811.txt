Abstract    :
              An existing real-time virtual reality database, created since 1997 and currently
              available only on a supercomputer at UCLA, will be converted to a format that
              can operate on the Internet. This database is a real-time computer model of the
              Roman Forum as it appeared in late antiquity. Created and authenticated by a
              Scientific Committee of leading archaeological experts on the Forum, the model
              includes the interiors and exteriors of each building and monument in the
              Forum. 

Research issues to be explored include: (1) How are real-time 3D
              computer models of cultural heritage sites like the Roman Forum best viewed on
              the Internet? (2) What other multimedia resources should accompany the 3D
              computer models to make the information offered about the site useful to
              scholars and students? (3) What does it mean to create an "authenticated" 3D
              computer model of a cultural heritage site? The existing Forum model will serve
              as a testbed for developing solutions to these problems. 

The project will
              help promote a better understanding of a key monument of Western civilization;
              and it will develop methodologies and technologies that can become standard
              solutions for the digital presentation of other important cultural heritage
              sites around the world.
