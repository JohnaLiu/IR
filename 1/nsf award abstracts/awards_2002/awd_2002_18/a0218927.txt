Abstract    :
              This research aims to further integrate the study of behavior in both animals
              and robots. The research investigates how rules of animal behavior can be
              analyzed, quantified, coded, and instantiated in robots. It focuses on
              individual and group sensorimotor behavior from a developmental perspective
              using Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus). Robotic rat pups will be built that
              instantiate sensorimotor rules discovered by careful observation and
              computational modeling of pups in isolation and in groups at different stages
              of development. Specific attention will be paid to how these rules change at
              different stages of development. For the study of behavior, the aim is to use
              robotic systems to validate rule-based computational models of behavior and
              generate testable predictions. For robotics, the aim is to transfer information
              from organisms that start out life as simple sensorimotor systems, but
              subsequently develop social behaviors, while developing new sensorimotor,
              learning, and cognitive capabilities. By studying precisely how these
              capabilities develop, this research will provide additional insight into the
              emergence of group behaviors in robotics. In the longer run, this research
              should facilitate the design of group robotic systems that develop greater and
              greater sensorimotor, learning, and cognitive capabilities over time.
