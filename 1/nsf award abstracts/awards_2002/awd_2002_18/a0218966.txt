Research
              has long documented that risks and opportunities vary systematically over space
              and time.   Just as poverty, residential instability, and home ownership are
              concentrated in certain sections of cities, so too are social disorder, crime,
              and violence as well as infant mortality, low birth weight, and accidents. 
              Rates of crime and other outcomes surge and decline with time, and some
              neighborhoods are more strongly affected by these changes than are other
              neighborhoods.  To examine how neighborhoods affect a variety of outcomes and
              how these effects change over time, this study will develop a method of
              statistical analysis that combines multilevel and spatial models.  Four aims
              organize the proposed work: 1) to incorporate a spatial auto-regressive process
              into the now-standard two-level hierarchical linear model; 2) to elaborate this
              model to include repeated measures on participants; 3) to incorporate repeated
              measures at the neighborhood level; and 4) to exploit spatial dependence in
              order to improve the reliability and validity of measures of neighborhood
              social process. Predictive validity will be assessed using data from thc
              Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN), which conducted
              a citywide neighborhood study in 1995 and will complete a replication of' this
              study in 2002. Methods will also be illustrated with PHDCN data on 6000 young
              people growing up in those neighborhoods between 1995 and 2002.  Software to
              implement the proposed methods will be tested through simulation studies before
              being distributed publicly.

The multilevel aspect of the model expresses the
              notion that urban space is divided into uniquely defined, more or less
              contiguous, self-contained "neighborhoods," often bounded by railroad tracks,
              major arteries, parks, or industrial districts. The spatial aspect of the model
              reflects theory and empirical evidence suggesting that neighborhoods, while
              somewhat distinct, are not independent. Rather, neighborhood social processes
              "spill over" into surrounding neighborhoods. The model thus represents the view
              that  neighborhoods are socially meaningful units that are linked spatially.
              Using the proposed methods, it will be possible to study not only how the
              social composition and processes in each neighborhood are related to human
              development but also how the composition and processes in surrounding
              neighborhoods affect the development of persons within a given neighborhood.
