Abstract    :
              The recent successful launch of the Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere,
              Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite presents a unique opportunity to
              obtain global measurements of the mesosphere that can be coordinated with
              ground-based instrumentation to further our understanding of the dynamics of
              this important region.  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
              project requests support for ground-based Medium Frequency (MF) radar
              measurements using the Imaging Doppler Interferometry (IDI) technique as
              implemented on the dynasonde operating at the Utah State University Bear Lake
              Observatory.  Because the IDI technique is viewed by many within the aeronomy
              community as being controversial, this study will also carry out a detailed
              analysis of coordinated meteor wind measurements, as well as undertaking a
              correlation analysis using similar measurements acquired with an MF radar being
              operated at the Platteville site in Colorado.
