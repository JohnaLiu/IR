This award will be used to support the
              participation of various professional scientists and graduate students on a
              workshop devoted to processes along the Kurile, Kamchatka, and Aleutians arcs
              that comprise one of the most active and least understood regions of volcanism
              and tectonism on Earth. This workshop will bring together workers from the US,
              Japan, and Russia who are dealing with understanding the same natural processes
              but within different politically designated intervals of this zone of
              subduction. The benefits are expected to extend beyond basic science to the
              coordinated monitoring and mitigation of natural hazards, such as those from
              earthquakes, tsunamis, and explosive volcanic eruptions and the sharing of
              information relevant to natural resources. An important role of the meeting
              will be to acquaint students with the broader context of their areas of 
              fieldwork and to facilitate direct contact with students from other countries.
              The intent is to stimulate international and interdisciplinary collaborations
              that will last throughout their careers. The meeting will also serve to inform
              and stimulate involvement by American geoscientists in their own island arc,
              the Aleutians. Although there has been rapid growth in hazards-driven
              monitoring and research there, the academic community of the lower 48 states
              has yet to take full advantage of the opportunities for basic research that the
              high level of activity of the Aleutians offers. The wish is to stimulate
              broader American participation in the volcanology of subduction, with a view
              toward developing a center-type initiative in the future.
