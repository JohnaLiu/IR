Mathematical and
              Algorithmic Analysis of Natural and Artificial DNA Sequences

The PI is
              developing tools that play an important role in understanding the properties of
              both natural and artificial genomes and thus, elucidates how such DNA evolves
              under natural and artificial conditions (in vitro or in vivo). The ultimate
              applications range from building error-resilient biological computers all the
              way up to understanding how genome structures (e.g., genes, gene families,
              synteny groups, haplotype blocks, chromosomes, etc.) have naturally
              evolved.

With this goal in mind, the PI is developing several modeling and
              statistical algorithms with efficient implementations in order to solve design
              problems in genomics, biosensors, biocomputation and evolutionary biology. The
              final  "tool box'' design contains: a software environment and language that
              allows users to visualize and analyze long DNA or RNA molecules, a "gene
              grammar" to model various genome-wide evolutionary processes, statistical
              analysis of the structures of various natural genomic DNAs evolving under
              replication and proof-reading processes and finally,  a physical annotation of
              the genome that can be used in designing genomic microarrays or aptamers for
              biosensors.
