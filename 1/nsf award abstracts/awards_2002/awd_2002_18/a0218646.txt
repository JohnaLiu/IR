              ABSTRACT

OCE-0218646


This study will continue the reference material
              program which for the last three years has made low dissolved organic carbon
              (DOC) reference material available to ocean chemists.  During this three year
              renewal, the PI will collect deep ocean water from the Sargasso Sea, prepare
              the water samples and have the DOC analyzed via consensus by a group of six
              independent laboratories.  Two of these consensus laboratories also will
              provide total nitrogen values for this DOC reference material.  Lastly, this
              program plans to double the number of users of the product to 150 laboratories
              worldwide.  The broader impact of this proposal is that of furnishing a DOC
              reference material to the scientific community involved in making DOC
              measurements which ensures that consistent, high quality DOC concentrations
              will be obtained by marine chemists both in the U.S. and abroad.
