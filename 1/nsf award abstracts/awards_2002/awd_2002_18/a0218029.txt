Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) is a 12 months study to develop
              new theoretical ideas about the processes through which firms evolve their
              dynamic capabilities. The study will contribute to the emerging body of work on
              the dynamic capabilities in two ways: a) by examining the role of managerial
              knowledge structures in shaping a firm's dynamic capabilities and their
              development: and b) by comparing the effects of differential environmental
              change (e.g., rate and predictability) on the process of capability
              development.

In conducting the proposed research the teams will take
              advantage of a naturally occurring experiment created by the terrorists attacks
              of September 2001. The large-scale dramatic change created by the events of
              September 11th will enable the research team to determine the impact of such
              change on the evolution of firms' capabilities. The study focuses on two
              industries - defense and biotechnology--that were both dramatically affected by
              the events of September 11th , yet have been characterized traditionally by
              different rates and types of change. The team will utilize a qualitative
              approach and rely primarily on an interview methodology to assess the processes
              of capability development in participating divisions of defense companies and
              biotechnology firms. The results of the study will be communicated through a
              series of company briefings, as well as publications in academic journals.
