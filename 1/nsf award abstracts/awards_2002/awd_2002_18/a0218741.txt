Abstract    :
              	This dissertation investigates how Danes mobilized in 1943 to rescue Danish
              Jews from Nazi deportation.  Unlike rescue efforts in other parts of occupied
              Europe, the Danish case was a nationwide collective movement.  The research
              should clarify the conditions facilitating high risk activism.  The Danish case
              will be compared with two other cases: the Netherlands (a similar culture
              without a collective response) and Le Chambon, France (a similar although
              smaller collective response, but a different culture).  The research will use
              archival data and interviews with participants to analyze the sources of the
              Danish movement.  Close attention will be paid to the role of social networks
              and the development of inclusive collective identities.  Pre-existing social
              networks connected by strong ties between separate clusters of people may be
              especially important for enabling this kind of high risk mobilization.  These
              networks are relatively uncommon since strong ties usually characterize
              overlapping but separate groups.  The usual use of weak ties to bridge those
              groups is not effective in high risk situations for which high trust is
              necessary to initiate mobilization attempts.
