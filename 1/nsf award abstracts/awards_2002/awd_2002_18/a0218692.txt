Abstract    :
              This project systematically investigates the value of pedagogical agent features
              (*image: character, realism, gender, ethnicity; *animation: task-related,
              expressive; and *pre-defined agent roles: expert, motivational advisor,
              co-collaborator) in supporting learning-related outcomes. Using Multiple
              Intelligent Mentors Instructing Collaboratively (MIMIC) as the research
              environment, the standard experimental research design includes multiple
              factors and will be analyzed primarily via MANOVA. Additional micro-genetic
              data from logged agent-learner interactions and supplemental case studies
              triangulate the findings. All participants are individually randomly assigned
              to treatment conditions with large sample sizes (125-200 students), including
              educational technology undergraduate  students from both a state university and
              a historically black university. The instructional content focuses upon the
              ill-structured domain of instructional planning with diverse learning outcomes,
              including metacognition, cognitive strategies, attitude/motivation, as well as
              traditional performance. Through extensive dissemination of results to the
              relevant multi-disciplinary communities, this project proposes to: a)
              illuminate principles of learning with pedagogical agents, b) facilitate
              computer scientists in prioritizing areas of future development for pedagogical
              agents; c) inform teachers of the most desirable characteristics of agent-based
              applications for their
students; d) refine key features for pedagogical agents
              within distance learning course  nvironments; and, e) advise instructional
              systems designers in developing training systems for industry and government.
