Collaborative
              Research: Quantum Mote Carlo Algorithms and Complexity

This collaborative
              project with the University of Connecticut is exploring both new quantum
              algorithmic techniques and tools for proving impossibility results for quantum
              computation. Specifically, the focus is on quantum Monte Carlo algorithms,
              which try to solve problems by doing a random walk in the space of possible
              solutions.  In addition, fundamental limits on the power of quantum
              computation, developing impossibility results for quantum circuits is being
              explored and proving that simple generalizations of Shor's factoring algorithm
              will not work for the Graph Isomorphism problem, which along with Factoring is
              a likely candidate for a quantum algorithm.

Specifically, quantum walks
              (unitary analogues of stochastic processes) on various combinatorial structures
              by employing both Fourier analysis for groups and new tools suited for less
              symmetric Spaces is being studied.  Cases where quantum walks explore the space
              more quickly than their classical counterparts, and other cases where they
              become localized and mix more slowly than a classical walk are being explored. 
              In addition Fourier analysis to develop lower bounds for shallow quantum
              circuits and information-theoretic bounds on the process of sampling from the
              quantum Fourier transform are being studied. In particular, the quantum Fourier
              transform over non-Abelian groups, and hidden subgroup and hidden subspace
              problems for such groups is being investigated.  This is closely related to
              Graph Isomorphism, and explore tractable special cases while showing it is hard
              for a Shor-type algorithm in general.
