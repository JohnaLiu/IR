Title:	      
                                       Investigation of hydrodynamics of suspensions of

ABSTRACT

The objective of the proposed project is to
              significantly improve the effectiveness of the boundary integral method by
              "hybridizing" it with a finite-difference technique. The purpose is to be able
              to carry out numerical simulations with many particles suspended in a fluid
              with the objective to study flow characteristics of drops, capsules, and
              particles. The novel aspect of the approach is to project the point force
              distribution on the boundary on an underlying collocation points and solve for
              the flow field on this grid.  The method will be applied to suspensions,
              emulsions with and without surfactants, capsules, and foams.  The method is
              shown to be scalable on large parallel processors.
