Abstract    :
              This is a US-Russian collaborative research project that will explore the
              isospin dependence of fragmentation and spallation reactions produced in 1 GeV
              proton induced reactions.  The principal investigator is Dr. ManYee B. Tsang
              from Michigan State University.   Her Russian collaborators are  Dr. Lyudmila
              Andronenko and Dr. Mikhail Andronenko from the St. Petersburg Nuclear Physics
              Institute.  

This project will take advantage of the unique capabilities of
              both research groups.  The US group pioneers the isoscaling analysis and
              modeling while the Russian group has accumulated 1 GeV proton induced
              fragmentation and spallation data on many different isotope targets over the
              past decades.  This collaboration will further understanding of the global
              nature of the isoscaling phenomenon and possible extraction of the symmetry
              terms in the Nuclear Equation of State.

This project in nuclear physics
              research fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts
              in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and
              capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of
              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
