Abstract    :
              This research focuses on the adoption of new process technologies by firms.  In
              particular, it looks at how the consequences of technology adoption are related
              to firms' organizational structures and the stages of the industry lifecycles. 
              

Existing evidence on industry evolution shows that industries go through
              one or more major episodes of restructuring during their lifecycles.  The
              evidence suggests that changes in the number of firms in an industry often
              occur at times when new technologies are introduced that change the competitive
              advantage among firms.  We will identify how the firm's organizational
              structure affects its ability to exploit industry transitions by successfully
              adopting new technologies and acquiring capacity through mergers and
              acquisitions in the restructuring of industries. 

This project will help
              understand how new technologies diffuse through the population of firms, and
              how this diffusion affects the size and organization of firms and their
              incentives to merge or acquire other firms.  Understanding how the process of
              diffusion occurs will help statisticians project future productivity increases
              and help in the evaluation of government policies to monitor increases in
              productivity.
