Decision-Making
              Deoxyribozyme Networks

In this project, silicomimetic networks of enzymes
              are being developed.  These networks will reproduce the functionality of
              individual silicon devices to perform Boolean algebra functions with analytical
              inputs and decision outputs and they represent first artificial autonomous
              decision-making sets of molecules with potential for incorporation into drug
              delivery or analytical systems. 
 
The computation components of these
              networks (i.e. "circuits") are being made modularly from deoxyribozyme-based
              logic gates (YESA, NOTA, AANDB, YESANOTB), which have oligonucleotides as
              inputs and outputs.  Communication between individual molecular gates is being
              developed through connections in which an output oligonucleotide, formed or
              degraded by a catalytic action of an upstream gate, is an input allosteric
              effector of a downstream gate.  This type of  communication allows serial
              connection or tiling of individual elements.  Computer program is being
              developed, which would aid in the construction of any decision-making tree from
              custom-made materials and then coupled to deoxyribozyme-based sensor arrays. 
              For example, one analytical network under construction senses the presence of
              an oligonucleotide, a small molecule and a protein, and makes a decision to
              release or not a fluorescent signal.
