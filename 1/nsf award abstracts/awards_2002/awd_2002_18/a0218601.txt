Proposal Title: ITR:Novel Hybrid {Discrete/Continuous} Computational Models
              for Very High Dimensional Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: From the Molecular to
              the Continuum Scale
Project Abstract
This ITR research and educational
              project is in an application area at the intersection of Information Technology
              and an engineering/science discipline. Work is proposed that will develop
              computational models of complex nonlinear dynamical systems that are often
              encountered in nanoscale phenomena and devices such as biological and polymer
              materials that are currently being studied experimentally with Atomic Force
              Microscopes. The principal goal is to develop a hybrid discrete/continuum model
              that will reduce by orders of magnitude the number of degrees of freedom needed
              to describe the system without any essential loss of information. 
The
              research will be complemented by an educational plan that includes a newly
              developed course, "Dynamics of Very High Dimensional Systems", the writing of a
              new textbook/monograph of that same title and the mentoring of a post-doc and
              undergraduate student who will assist with the research and the new course.
