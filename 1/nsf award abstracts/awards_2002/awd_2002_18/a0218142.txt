ITR/DDDAS Generalized
              Polynomial Chaos:  Parallel Algorithms for Modeling and Propagating Uncertainty
              in Physical and Biological Systems

The applications we target are prototype
              problems in bioengineering and in nanotechnology.  The coupled nature of such
              problems and the many parameters involved provide a good testbed for evaluating
              the performance of the new algorithms at resolutions from 0.1 to 1 billion
              degrees-of-freedom.  The sources of uncertainty may  be caused  by incomplete
              knowledge or fluctuations in boundary or initial conditions, geometric domain,
              transport coefficients, mechanical properties, and other external forcing or
              volumetric sources.

The proposed work will have significant and broad impact
              as it will establish a composite error bar in large-scale simulations and will
              enable numerical stochastic approaches to large-scale simulations of physical
              and biological systems.  It will also benefit many other fields including
              climate and network/web traffic modeling, where current uncertainty modeling
              approaches are inadequate.  Stochastically simulated responses can serve as
              sensitivity analysis that could potentially guide experimental work and dynamic
              instrumentation.
