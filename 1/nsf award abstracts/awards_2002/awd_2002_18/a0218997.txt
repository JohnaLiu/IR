Abstract    :
              This project explores new ways of searching, organizing, preserving, and
              interacting with large information resources in the humanities and the social
              sciences. It involves the creation and support of a digital library of
              materials of significant international importance drawn from the Franklin D.
              Roosevelt Library and Digital Archives (which includes image, sound, video and
              textual data), and the encoding, annotation, and multi-modal linkage of a
              portion of the collection to develop state-of-the-art methods for search and
              retrieval. The goal is to establish methods and procedures that can be later
              applied to the full FDR collection, and to consider the best means to enable
              flexible and creative access to this important resource. 

The project
              involves, on the one hand, computer scientists with significant experience in
              the representation of and access to on-line data, together with historians who
              require sophisticated and intelligent access to on-line historical resources.
              Because we will apply techniques from several technical fields to data that is
              typical of the humanities, the project represents an important
              cross-disciplinary effort. Another benefit is the collaboration between two
              undergraduate liberal arts institutions, Marist College and Vassar College, and
              the potential to involve students from both institutions in cutting edge
              research.
