Abstract    :
              This proposal focuses on improvements in spectral boundary element method for
              simulation of multiphase flows.  These include drops and cells suspended in
              Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids that may be subjected to steady and
              oscillatory flows.  A convincing case was made that the computational time will
              be significantly reduced using the proposed algorithm.  The proposed
              educational activities are well integrated into the planned research.
