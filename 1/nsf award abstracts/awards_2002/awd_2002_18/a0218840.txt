Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Society Symposium on Solid State Chemistry of Inorganic
              Materials IV will be held in Boston, MA December 2-6, 2002.  The goal of the
              conference is to facilitate multidisciplinary interactions information exchange
              within a broad spectrum of researchers, to include CAREER grantees, and top
              post doctoral scholars and graduate students working in priority areas of the
              broad field of solid-state chemistry.  The NSF funds will be used exclusively
              to offset the expenses associated with attending the symposium for U.S.
              participants, specifically graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, junior
              faculty and selected plenary speakers in the area of solid state chemistry of
              inorganic materials.

The Solid State Chemistry community continues to have a
              direct impact on important technological areas that are crucial to advancing
              society through the design, synthesis and application new materials.  Examples
              include porous solids for catalysis, thin films for electronics and
              electrooptic devices, and nanostructured materials for high-strength composite
              structural materials.  Since these technical areas are of very high priority to
              industry, students educated and trained in these multidisciplinary areas
              involving solid-state chemistry compete very well in the job market and go on
              to contribute in many significant ways to the global economy.
