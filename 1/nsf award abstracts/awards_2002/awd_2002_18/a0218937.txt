Abstract    :
              This proposal is to support work on developing an interactive Grid-enabled
              analysis environment for physicists working on the high energy physics CMS
              experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Switzerland. The
              environment will be lightweight yet highly functional and will make use of
              existing CMS tools as plug-in components. It will consist of tools and
              utilities that expose Grid system functions, parameters and behavior at
              selectable levels of detail and complexity. Use will be made of Web services
              and it is expected that many of the components will be sufficiently generic to
              be useful for other experiments and scientific endeavors utilizing Grid
              computing technology. 
The effort is closely related to work ongoing in the
              GriPhyN,  iVDGL, PPDG and SciDAC projects.
