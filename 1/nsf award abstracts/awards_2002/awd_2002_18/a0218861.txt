Abstract    :
              The Genesis Group of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory is working
on a
              computational theory of human intelligence.  Their work is grounded in
two key
              assumptions: first, that humans think with their language, vision,
and motor
              systems, and their interaction; and second that humans can think
abstractly
              because they can build on a foundation of thinking about concrete
events in
              the physical world.

Their plan includes the development of a testbed that
              features paths,
agents, causes, both language and visual inputs and outputs,
              complex state
transitions, and support for abstract reasoning in abstract
              worlds.

They propose to exploit both symbolic and nonsymbolic
              representations.  The
symbolic representations will include a representation
              for describing the
movement of animals and artifacts along trajectories and a
              representation
for describing state transitions in terms of a vocabulary of
              qualitative
changes.  The nonsymbolic representations will include memory
              traces lying
close to experienced sensory inputs.

The Genesis Group expects
              success to lead not only to a better
understanding of natural intelligence buy
              also, in the long term, to
important practical results, such as computer
              applications with genuine
commonsense and educational applications that
              exploit an understanding of
how best to engage human linguistic and visual
              problem solving faculties.
