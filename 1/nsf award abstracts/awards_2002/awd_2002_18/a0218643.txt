Abstract    :
              Research is proposed on 1) visualization of the diffusion monte carlo algorithm
              as it is applied to He clusters and 2) calculations of the excited electronic
              states of He clusters using a new monte carlo development.  The calculations
              will be treating many-body systems of up to 300 degress of freedom and will
              examine the computational issues associated with parallelization of the needed
              algorithm.
