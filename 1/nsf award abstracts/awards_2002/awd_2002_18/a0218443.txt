Collaborative
              Research: Quantum Mote Carlo Algorithms and Complexity

This collaborative
              project with the University of New Mexico is exploring both new quantum
              algorithmic techniques and tools for proving impossibility results for quantum
              computation. Specifically, the focus is on quantum Monte Carlo algorithms,
              which try to solve problems by doing a random walk in the space of possible
              solutions.  In addition, fundamental limits on the power of quantum
              computation, developing impossibility results for quantum circuits is being
              explored and proving that simple generalizations of Shor's factoring algorithm
              will not work for the Graph Isomorphism problem, which along with Factoring is
              a likely candidate for a quantum algorithm.

Specifically, quantum walks
              (unitary analogues of stochastic processes) on various combinatorial structures
              by employing both Fourier analysis for groups and new tools suited for less
              symmetric Spaces are being studied.  Cases where quantum walks explore the
              space more quickly than their classical counterparts, and other cases where
              they become localized and mix more slowly than a classical walk are being
              explored.  In addition Fourier analysis to develop lower bounds for shallow
              quantum circuits and information-theoretic bounds on the process of sampling
              from the quantum Fourier transform are being studied. In particular, the
              quantum Fourier transform over non-Abelian groups, and hidden subgroup and
              hidden subspace problems for such groups is being investigated.
