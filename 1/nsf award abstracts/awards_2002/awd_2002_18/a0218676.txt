Abstract    :
              EIA 0218767 Jerome Pine California Institute of Technology Title:  A Neurochip
              for Studying Neural Networks in Vitro
	The mammalian central nervous system
              has enormous capabilities for information processing; analysis; and generation
              of appropriate outputs for a huge variety of task.  It far surpasses current
              best efforts with man-made hardware and software.  Learning in detail about how
              real neural networks function holds the promise of guiding efforts to improve
              man-made systems, and perhaps showing the way to revolutionary rather than
              evolutionary improvements.  Yet doing this is a daunting task for in vivo
              systems, where huge numbers of neurons operate cooperatively, and observation
              of their individual behaviors in full detail is far beyond the capabilities of
              current technology.  Understanding the behavior of small neural networks in
              vitro is a potentially valuable start, and it is proposed here to create a
              silicon-based system, called a "Neurochip", with unique capabilities for
              observing the behavior of every neuron of a small network in detail.  Each
              neuron will be in an enclosure" which incorporates an intracellular electrode
              for recording and stimulation.

The experimental system is being constructed
              mainly from commercial components.  The neurochip itself is being fabricated
              using novel methods, but ones, which can be duplicated, in any serious
              fabrication laboratory.  The low temperature fabrication process for the
              neurochip can be done on a silicon wafer, which incorporates CMOS circuitry, so
              an on-board computer could be made part of the system.
