Time Optimal Control of
              Quantum Information Processing Systems

Time optimal control of quantum
              mechanical systems can significantly minimize decoherence effects in coherent
              manipulation of quantum pheonomenon. The central theme of the project  is to
              develop a mathematical theory for optimal unitary control of  quantum networks.
              Network of coupled two level quantum systems form the benchmark for a quantum
              computer. Finding the minimum time it takes to produce a desired unitary
              evolution in a network of coupled quantum systems is of fundamental practical
              importance not just in the field of quantum information processing but the
              whole field of coherent spectroscopy. In particular, focus is on optimal
              control of network of coupled spin half particles (acting as qubits in liquid
              and solid state NMR quantum conputing with fixed interaction Hamiltonian and
              ability to selectively excite some of the qubits. One of the goals of this
              project is to develop geometric methods for computing fundamental bounds on the
              minimum time it takes to produce unitary evolution in a network of coupled
              quantum systems and find time optimal control laws which achieve these bounds.
              

These methods are based on variational ideas as captured by the theory of
              optimal control. Finding optimal strategies to control the dynamics of quantum
              networks can be reduced to problems in Riemannian geometry of computing
              subriemannian geodesics in certain homogeneous spaces. Using these geometric
              techniques time optimal control strategies for quantum networks are being
              computed.
