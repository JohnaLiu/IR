Electromagnetic and informational processes in biomolecular
              polymers

In this project the electric dipole moment and quantum properties
              of tubulin, microtubules (MTs), microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and
              cytoskeletal networks immobilized on thin metal films utilizing surface plasmon
              resonance and femtosecond laser pulses are being studied. The goal is to
              understand the electrical and conjectured quantum properties of the
              cytoskeleton and determine whether biomolecular polymers and specifically
              tubulin can be used as bits or qubits in the protein-based devices such as
              logic gates, nanowires and memory registers in the biological and quantum
              computers of the future. Measurements of the electric dipole moment of tubulin
              and its dynamics in polymerized and free tubulin, investigate the formation and
              propagation of the predicted kink-solitonic electric dipole moment flip waves
              and monitor the polymerization and dynamics of MT-MAP networks under different
              conditions are being measured. In addition, this research is ideally suited to
              test MT-based 'quantum brain' and 'quantum neuron' models predicting such
              phenomena as large-scale neuronal quantum coherence and teleportation of dipole
              quanta.
