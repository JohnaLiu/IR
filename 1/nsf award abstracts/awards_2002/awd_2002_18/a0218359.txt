Molecular Robotics for DNA
              Nanostructures

The objective of this project is to develop molecular motors
              that are incorporated into self-assembled DNA lattices. The main goal of this
              project will be to develop experimental proof-of concept demonstrations of the
              construction of novel DNA motors such as a DNA motor that is designed to have
              both translational and rotational motion. Incorporation of molecular motors
              into DNA arrays has many applications: It can selectively manipulate molecules
              using molecular motor devices arranged on DNA tiling arrays; A DNA array of
              motors may offer a mechanism to do DNA computation of arrays whose elements
              (the tiles) hold state; Parallel cellular automata computation may be executed
              from arrays of finite state automata each of which hold state. This project is
              also developing DNA nanostructures containing motors that operate autonomously
              without environmental changes. Methods are being tested to use "fuel DNA" to
              provide energy to drive the motion of DNA nanostructures. As an alternative
              approach, experiments are conducted to incorporate protein motors such as
              Kinesin into DNA lattices. In particular, the use of selective aptamer binding
              to link protein motors to periodic sites of a DNA lattice will be tested. The
              resulting arrays of protein motors have many applications to nanorobotics,
              e.g., they are potentially very useful for sorting and transport of
              nanoparticles.
