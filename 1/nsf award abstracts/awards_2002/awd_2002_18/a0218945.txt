Abstract    :
              The PI will carry out exposure experiments of fresh basaltic glass in seawater
              on the ocean floor, and compare the results to the behavior of natural basalt
              glass exposed at the same site in terms of the role of microbial communities in
              the alteration of the glass. Study environments are located on the submarine
              slopes of Hawaii at water depths ranging from 200-2000m, at water temperatures
              ranging from near freezing to hydrothermal spring temperatures of approximately
              80 degree C. Exposed rock surfaces vary in age from a few years to several
              100kyrs and include sites on Loihi Seamount, Puna Ridge and the submarine
              slopes of Kohala and Hualalai. With other funds from NOAA's NURP program, the
              PIs will undertake 16 submersible dives in FY's 2002/2003, to carry out the
              field portion of the study. This award will support cruise participation for
              the recovery of previously-placed exposure charges, and the chemical, and
              microbiological laboratory investigations of materials recovered from the
              dives. The PIs will observe and characterize the microbial populations and
              physical effects of natural microbial alteration on well defined glass
              surfaces. They will compare reaction rates in the one-year exposure experiments
              to the rates of basalt alteration in natural exposure of several years to
              nearly a million years. Chemical mass balance will allow the PIs to determine
              the chemical exchange rates between seawater and the  basalt exposure
              experiments.
