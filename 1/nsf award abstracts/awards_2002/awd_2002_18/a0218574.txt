Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to develop an innovative algorithmic development to simulate
              physical problems involving large-deformatin interactions among multiple
              materials such as fluid/solid regions with moving boundaries at the interface. 
              The proposed research advances Information Technology through the development
              of a new paradigm, which incorporates leading-edge simulation techniques with
              high performance computing and data visualization.
