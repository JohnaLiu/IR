Description: This award provides partial support for the
              first ICFA School/Workshop at the new Center for Instrumentation at Istanbul
              Technical University (ITU) in Istanbul, Turkey, June 17-28, 2002.  ICFA, which
              is the International Committee on Future Accelerators, has been holding a
              regular series of instrumentation schools/workshops every two years in
              different locations.  The US organizers for this school/workshop are Dr.
              Marleigh Sheaff, Senior Scientist Emerita, University of Wisconsin, Madison and
              member of the International Committee on Future Accelerators (ICFA), and Dr.
              Muzaffer Atac of Fermilab and UCLA and the Scientific and Technical Advisor for
              the Center.  The Turkish co-organizer is Professor Mahmut Hortacsu of Istanbul
              Technical University, who is also the Director of the new Center.  The Center
              for Instrumentation will be a permanent facility where lecture courses and lab
              exercises will be offered on a regular basis to students from Turkey and other
              countries in the Africa, Near East, and South Asia region. This first workshop
              at the Center focuses on instrumentation in elementary particle physics.  The
              goals of the workshop are to encourage the development of instrumentation by
              the students at their home institutions and to promote collaboration among
              physicists at early stages in their careers.

Scope: Turkey is a suitable
              host for this workshop because of its location between Europe and Asia and its
              proximity to Africa, from which it is especially desirable to attract students.
              The Center for Instrumentation will provide training and online help with
              questions on instrumentation for the students after they return to their home
              institutions.  Support for the new center will be provided by Istanbul
              Technical University and by the Turkish Science and Technology Council
              (TUBITAK). Several other Turkish universities are also expected to contribute. 
              This award is supported by the Office of International Science and Engineering
              and the Division of Physics.
