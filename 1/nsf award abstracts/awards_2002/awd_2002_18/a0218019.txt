Abstract    :
              This proposal describes a set of new techniques for managing access to remote
              files in the wide area. The vehicle for evaluating these techniques will be a
              wide-area file system called MoteFS. MoteFS will provide fast, flexible, and
              secure access to remote files over untrusted wide-area networks.  In more
              detail, the following mechanisms and policies will be investigated:
-
              fine-grained namespace mechanisms that allow namespaces to be efficiently and
              securely added, mutated, transferred and deleted at granularities from single
              files to millions of files.
- decomposable credentials, which allow credential
              holders to locally derive and transfer weaker credentials without contacting
              file owners.
- a cross-server versioning abstraction, which allows correlated
              versions of a group of files to be referenced even if they span multiple users
              and file systems.
- client-side differencing, which allows redundant data to
              be eliminated during network writebacks.
- wide-area prefetching and caching
              algorithms.
The combined effect of these techniques will allow allow users to
              interact with their files in a flexible, secure, location-independent manner.
