Abstract    :
              An important and challenging question currently facing biologists is the
              identification of binding sites in DNA.  These regulatory elements are for the
              proteins that are involved in the regulation of genes.  The appropriate
              computational tools can be extremely valuable for pruning the search space of
              experiments, efficiently suggesting potential regulatory elements on which to
              focus limited laboratory resources.  As more related genomes are sequenced and
              our understanding of regulatory relationships among genes, improves, a novel
              problem arises that is addressed here.  Namely, the data to be analyzed will
              often be heterogeneous, a collection of co-regulated genes from one species
              together with their orthologous, i.e., corresponding, genes in several related
              species.  This project will design, implement, and test algorithms for this
              novel problem and related issues in the discovery of regulatory elements. All
              software will be made freely available on the Internet.
