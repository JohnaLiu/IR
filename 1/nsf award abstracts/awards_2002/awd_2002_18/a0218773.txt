A National Agenda for Advancing the Undergraduate
              Mathematics Curriculum

This project supports a major initiative to stimulate
              and direct curriculum development and collaborative multidisciplinary
              relationships for the undergraduate program in the mathematical sciences. The
              project creates a set of curricular recommendations and an agenda for
              implementing them, and these are disseminated to mathematics faculty and
              department chairs, deans, and faculty in partner disciplines. The goals of the
              project are 
1. To expand the numbers of students undertaking substantial
              study of the mathematical sciences, majoring in the physical sciences and
              technology as well as in the mathematical sciences, and continuing to graduate
              study in these areas;
2. To better prepare students for teaching, scientific
              careers, employment in business or industry, and other jobs for which
              mathematical preparation is needed;
3. To improve curricular offerings for
              students who might take only one college-level course in the mathematical
              sciences.

An outcome of the project is a publication of recommendations and
              models of good practice for the undergraduate program in the mathematical
              sciences that are based on extensive consultations with mathematicians and
              users of mathematics.

The Division of Undergraduate Education and the
              Division of Mathematical Sciences jointly funded this project.
