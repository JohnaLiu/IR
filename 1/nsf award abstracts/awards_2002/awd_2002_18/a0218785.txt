Abstract    :
              This project will manage the coordination, synthesis, data collection and
              outreach for the PARCS (Paleoenvironmental Arctic Sciences) component of the
              ARCSS (Arctic System Science) Program. These activities will provide overall
              coordination of PARCS research to maximize its scientific impact and
              productivity.  To achieve its goals, the PARCS Science Committee (SC) will
              support: (1) data and science management, (2) workshops and Working Group
              meetings to coordinate regional-scale projects and integration of specific data
              sets to address the two research priorities, (3) a PARCS Community Meeting to
              assess the outcome of research on the two priority topics and formulate new
              research priorities and collaborations, and (4) outreach efforts to disseminate
              information on current PARCS activities and the results of the PARCS research
              efforts.
