Abstract    :
              This is a US-Polish collaborative research project on new possibilities for
              Higgs physics and electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB).  The principal
              investigator is Dr.  John Gunion from the University of California at Davis.  
              His Polish collaborator is Dr. Bohdan Grzadkowski from Warsaw University. 
              

The researchers will focus on exploring new possibilities for WESB and
              Higgs physics as well as on means for testing these new ideas using forthcoming
              accelerator data.
Progress made in this research area could have profound
              impact on interpreting new accelerator data in such a way that fundamental
              progress in the construction of an ultimate theory of elementary
              particle/fundamental interactions will be possible.   This project will also
              provide US graduate students opportunities to enhance their experience and
              familiarity with the global science and engineering world.

This project in
              physics fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in
              the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and
              capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of
              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
