Title:
              "Collaborative research: Computerized Decision Aid for Acute Care Nursing"

 
               This project addressed problems associated with building Decision Support
              Systems to serve nursing. Most healthcare environments call upon nurse
              clinicians to make complex decisions on a contiual basis. Automated decision
              support systems backed by evidence-based knowledge and standardized guides,
              such as clinical algorithms, are capable of supporting clinical nursing
              decisions. However, effective real-time access is limited. This project
              addresses this problem by delivering current clinical knowledge via an
              off-the-shelf handheld computer using wireless access to a central server. 
              Innovative data mining and knowledge discovery algorithms, using a combination
              of case based and rule based learning with added confidence measures, permit
              bi-directional inferencing based on individual client data. This technology
              provides real-time decision support for the multiple cases and sequential
              decisions characterzing present nursing practice. Nurses are able to consider a
              full range of alternative explanations, determine addtional data needs, find,
              isolate and examine patient case outliers for additional diagnostic data or
              verify the appropriateness of a  selected strategy. A fully developed system
              may have the capacity to maintain a history of series of decisions and outcomes
              thereby, overtime, improving the case base and rule bases used for decision
              support. Outcomes of this real time decision support may include timely health
              care, less biased decisions, and improved patient outcomes.
