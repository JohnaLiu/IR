Abstract    :
                   This award is for a study entitled "Crossing Death Valley Together:
              Industry-University Intellectual Property Dynamics" which is designed to
              provide a systematic inquiry into the organizational-level dynamics between
              industry and universities around intellectual property (IP).  While interest in
              IP has soared since the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, virtually all data collected on
              IP centers on the positives in the aggregate; the number of licenses negotiated
              the number of patents or disclosures, the total number of revenues or number of
              products launched.  There is little information on what doesn't work, failures
              and strained relationships, or the impact on broader industry-university
              relations on current emphasis on IP.
     The material will be gathered
              through confidential (i.e., not-for-attribution), face-to-face interviews
              essential to get at the rationales, expectations, criteria and comparisons that
              frame the decision-makers understandings.  Sources for the study will include
              university administrators, faculty and technology management officers, industry
              managers responsible for dealing with universities and a limited number of
              interviews with venture capital managers.  Data analysis will center on
              in-depth content analysis of interview materials in search of underlying models
              of practice together with statistics characterizing the interviews and
              comparisons with available quantitative data including AUTM surveys and
              information on IP failures. The research will be conducted with the 
              cooperation with the Industrial Research Institute and the Center for
              Innovative Management Systems.
