Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is a systematic computer-aided design system for the
              synthesis of mechanical devices that guide spatial movement.  Existing design
              systems can display and animate a predefined device, but none have the ability
              to assist an inventor in finding a new device given a description of its
              desired function.  This function to form synthesis process has been developed
              for planar mechanisms, and our goal is to extend it to spatial mechanisms and
              robots.  The basic strategy is to evaluate the kinematics equations of an
              articulated chain at goal positions that define the desired movement workspace.
               The solution of these equations define the physical dimensions of the chain. 
              The architecture of the design system is structured to provide platform
              independence and to be compatible with collaborative use and development via
              the Internet. 

If successful, this research will provide the theory and an
              example implementation of a design system that enables mechanical designers to
              specify a desired spatial movement and the topology of a device, to
              automatically formulate and solve the associated design equations, and then to
              interactively survey, evaluate, and modify candidate designs.  Preliminary
              results show that this has the potential to make available a large number of
              devices for inventive applications.  The resulting products can provide
              effective low-cost automation for the home, office and factory.
