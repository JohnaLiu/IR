This Information Technology Research Program grant supports
              the development of a distributed computing infrastructure in computational
              petrology.  The computational model calls for the development of highly
              optimized and rigorously tested server code that will be built to perform basic
              level phase property/stability calculations.  This code will be published as an
              Application Programming Interface (API) and distributed via a CORBA IDL to
              client machines on the Internet. Remote users will access the server in one of
              two ways: either as remote procedure calls from user written clients, or by
              downloading clients developed in conjunction with the server code effort that
              are designed to solve specific problems.  Clients will be written to address
              the needs of both the research and the teaching community.  Extensive
              documentation and tutorials will be produced.
