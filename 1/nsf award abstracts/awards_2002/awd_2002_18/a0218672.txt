Abstract    :
               

In many imaging applications, mobile agents--such as untethered
              reconnaissance robots and micro air vehicles--transmit and receive
              bandwidth-intensive image data over wireless networks. A key issue in
              developing small, mobile agents is minimizing their power requirements. The
              most significant source of power dissipation in a wireless communications
              system is the transmission of data over the wireless link. Compressing the data
              before transmission is a direct way to significantly decrease power
              requirements; thus, effective image compression algorithms are critical to
              realizing a mobile, wireless, real-time, high quality imaging
              system.

Various hardware platforms can be considered for mobile computing.
              Of these platforms, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are the most
              compelling for wireless, mobile, fast, low-power, handheld/wearable/embedded,
              image compression devices. FPGAs can be used as the basis for implementations
              that are low cost, easily updated, and significantly faster than
              microprocessor-based implementations.

The objective of this project is
              twofold: to design new, efficient image compression algorithms and to design,
              build, demonstrate and evaluate FPGA implementations of state-of-the-art image
              compression systems. Our close-knit interdisciplinary team of image compression
              and hardware specialists will allow for end-to-end system performance analysis.
              This critical assessment is almost never performed and yet it is important to
              understanding the combined effects of algorithmic and implementation design
              choices.

In addition, two or three real-world interdisciplinary projects
              that can be utilized in senior-level digital signal processing and digital
              design classes will be designed and published.
