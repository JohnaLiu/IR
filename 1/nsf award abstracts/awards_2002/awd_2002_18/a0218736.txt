He
The past decade, dubbed the "Decade of the Brain", has witnessed
              explosive growth in the ability to observe and measure brain activity in human
              subjects.  The technique of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has
              enabled precise anatomical localization of brain structures that are activated
              during certain psychological processes.  Though fMRI has high spatial
              resolution, temporal resolution is on the order of a second.  In contrast,
              electrophysiological (EEG type) recordings, which can be obtained from the
              scalp and measure the electrical activity of ensembles of neurons activated
              synchronously (event-related potentials (ERP) provide millisecond level
              temporal resolution but limited spatial resolution.  Tremendous efforts have
              been made to localize electrical source generators within the brain that
              underlie ERP components evoked by specific sensory, motor, or cognitive events.
               The approach, called electrophysiological neuroimaing, attempts to image the
              neural source distribution within the brain from electophysiological recordings
              obtained over the scalp by deconvolving the volume conduction process.  

The
              focus of this proposal is to achieve high spatial and temporal resolution in
              brain imaging by mathematically combining MRI and EEG data.  The method
              involves placing constraints derived from one imaging modality on possible
              inverse solutions of the other modality.  Once the algorithms are developed,
              the method will be applied to obtaining finer localization of brain structures
              involved in detecting and responding to an error in a cognitive task.  The
              multimodal brain imaging technique will be assessed for applicability and
              performance in studying executive control systems in healthy subjects and
              disturbance of executive functions in selected groups of patients with
              schizophrenia.
