This award will support Dr. Deepak G. Bhat and Dr Ajay P.
              Malshe to visit Dr. Mariana Staia, of the Department of Materials Science and
              Metallurgical Engineering of the Central University of Venezuela in order to
              plan a research  collaboration on the fundamental tribological interactions of
              coated tools.  While the need for durable surface-engineered tools has long
              been recognized, the tribology, chemistry, and physics of materials
              interactions at the mating surfaces and contact points between the tool and
              work-piece are not fully understood. For instance, stringent machining and
              frictional conditions require effective lubrication over a wide temperature
              range, where the stability of the coating may itself be compromised. 

The
              visit will help to design a study that aims to improve the process of producing
              coatings for cutting tools with the potential of minimizing the need for
              coolants and lubricants in machining and lessening negative impacts on the
              environment.   The US group will contribute their expertise in machining and
              processing while the Venezuelan side has the equipment and the expertise for
              tribological and metallurgical tests.
