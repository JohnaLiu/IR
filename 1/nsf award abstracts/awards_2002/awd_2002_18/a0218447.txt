Ribozymes as
              Molecular Logic Gates

Biological macromolecules have the potential to
              perform computations.  'DNA computers' such as those pioneered by Adleman and
              his co-workers have already been shown to be able to perform simple
              calculations.  However, these computers have for the most part been based on
              'hybridization logic' involving base-pairing interactions between digitally
              encoded strands.  The emphasis on 'hybridization logic' limits the utility and
              applicability of nucleic acid computation because there are very few ways to
              read in environmental conditions or read out answers.

Nucleic acid enzymes
              (ribozymes) may prove to be the equivalent of the transistors or logic gates
              that underlie silicon computation, and could potentially increase the ultimate
              applicability of nucleic acid computation by interfacing directly with the
              environment and generating easily read answers.  Ribozyme logic gates will be
              developed and integrated with mesoscale shape elements (known as MUFFINS) for
              the logical evaluation of sets of analytes in the environment.
