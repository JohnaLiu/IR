Abstract    :
              Greg Voth, Gary Ayton, and Thomas Cheatham of the University of Utah are
              supported by the Division of Chemistry through the Information Technology
              Research program in a collaborative effort between theoretical chemistry and
              computational biology.  They will develop and implement a novel multi-scale
              computational grid simulation method designed to examine spatially and
              temporally coupled phenomena in large biomolecular assemblies.  Applications
              include DNA, actin filaments, microtubes, and amyloid plaques.

Currently, it
              is computationally intractable to perform atomistic simulations on macro-scale
              dimensional problems. Moreover, traditional continuum simulation methods break
              down as the meso-scale regime is reached.  This research is expected to result
              in the construction of a viable micro-to-macro simulation methodology which, in
              the context of large biological systems, will address long-range
              electrostatics, water vibrations, solvent interactions, conformational
              sampling, and external fields.
