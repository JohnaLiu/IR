Development of computer-aided stereographic projection
              techniques has greatly aided interpretation of Earth Science structure and
              processes. We have developed and implemented an affordable PC/Linux based
              stereo projection system ("the Geowall") that can be used by individual
              research groups and within the undergraduate curriculum.  The main goals of
              this collaborative Information Technology Research project between the
              University of Michigan (EAR-
0219246; PI: P. van Keken) and the University of
              Illinois at Chicago  are to greatly improve the content development and
              delivery for Earth Science applications. This will include the development of
              conversion software and viewers for existing Earth Science applications;
              implementation of tools for interaction and manipulation of 3D data; testing of
              these tools in Earth Science departments; improvement of the collaborative
              environment for work between groups of researchers; and dissemination through
              the Geowall consortium (geowall.org).
