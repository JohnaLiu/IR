This award supports Professor Alan Strahler, a graduate
              student, and colleagues from Boston University  for travel to collaborate in
              remote sensing research with Dr. David Lupp and others of the CSIRO Earth
              Observation Center in Canberra, Australia and with Professor Ziaowan Li and
              colleagues of the Institute of Remote Sensing Application of the Chinese
              Academy of Sciences. NSF support will enable the US group to participate in
              ongoing field measurements in Australia and China and to work with their
              collaborators to improve their theory.

Their work focuses on the imaging of
              vegetation canopies from aircraft or satellites using radiometric instruments. 
              They are developing an alternative to the radiative transfer theory of how
              light is scattered by vegetation canopies.  Their approach describes the canopy
              as a collection of discrete three-dimensional objects, which leads to many
              practical applications.  Their fundamental objective is to retrieve details
              from the vegetation cover such as the size, shape and spacing of the leaves and
              plants.   This information will have direct application to studying the carbon
              balance and dynamics of vegetated ecosystems at landscape scales.
