Abstract    :
              The proposed research aims at extending the benefits of scaling (i.e., Moore's
              Law) into the ub-0.07$\mu$m regime by developing error control techniques for
              digital sequential circuits.  The overall goal is to evaluate the practical
              implications of recently developed dynamic error correction and algorithmic
              noise tolerance techniques in terms of enabling the design of sequential
              circuit architectures that are cost-effective and operate at speed and energy
              efficiencies that exceed the limits imposed by current VLSI architectures. 
              The
successful completion of this project can lead to the development of
              acomprehensive set of circuit design techniques that permit tradeoffs between
              reliability, speed and energy-efficiency in ways that have not
been exploited
              before. 

The objectives of this research thrust are two-fold:  (i)  The
              immediate goal is to develop error control methodologies that enable the
              construction of functional sequential systems out of unreliable components that
              may be fast, inexpensive or have reduced energy requirements.  The novelty of
              the proposed research lies in that it it explores the case when the error
              correction mechanism operates at a different time scale than the rest of the
              system.  (ii)  The ultimate goal is to build prototypes of such sequential
              circuits in order to
evaluate their actual performance and potential. 

The
              proposed research also has a significant educational and outreach
component,
              motivating graduate students to contribute to research that
focuses on the
              fringes of circuit theory, signal processing, coding
and graph theory, control
              theory and information theory.
