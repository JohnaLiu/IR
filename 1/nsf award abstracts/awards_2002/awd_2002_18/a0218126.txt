This award provides travel support for a delegation of
              senior and junior scientists to the US-India Workshop: Learning from the Indian
              Development Experience, Bangalore, November 2002.  US PI Tojo Thatchenkery,
              Department of Social & Organizational Learning, George Mason University (GMU)
              and Chiranjib Sen, School of Public Policy, Indian Institute of Management
              (IIM), Bangalore are co-organizers of this workshop.  This gathering of
              scholars from a range of disciplines will focus on India's development
              experience, particularly as related to the emerging Information and
              Communication Technology (ICT) industry.  The assumption is that the Indian
              development model is different from other national development success stories
              such as for Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong.  The workshop will
              contribute to fuller understanding of India's innovation-led development
              (private sector) model and its applicability to other developing countries. 
              The workshop will foster Indo-US collaboration and create a collaborative
              program between GMU and the IIM's School of Public Policy, which will study
              policy implications of ICT for India's globalization efforts.  The proceedings
              of the workshop will be published.  Funding for this workshop is provided
              jointly by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division
              of Social and Economic Sciences.
