Abstract    :
              Water and carbon dioxide, in either liquid or supercritical phases, are widely
              regarded as
environmentally benign media for organic chemical reactions. 
              Significant effort has been
devoted to developing useful chemistries in these
              solvents as a means of pollution prevention.  All of this previous work has
              used either water or carbon dioxide separately. The proposed research involves
              the use of mixtures of these two compounds as the reaction medium for
              acid-catalyzed, organic chemical reactions. Water will be the main component in
              the system.  Experiments with different acid-catalyzed reactions (e.g., phenol
              alkylation, alcohol dehydration, etc.) will be performed, and the effects of
              the composition of the reaction medium, the system density, temperature,
              reactant concentrations, and reaction time on reactant conversion and product
              yields will be determined. In terms of the broader impacts, acid-catalyzed
              reactions are used widely in the chemical industry. It has been estimated that
              the number of commercially important acid-catalyzed reactions exceeds the
              number of all other catalytic reactions combined. Therefore, advances that make
              acid-catalysis more environmentally benign could have a broad impact throughout
              the chemical industry. The practice of incorporating examples from the research
              in graduate and undergraduate class will be continued. The results from this
              research project will provide the reaction kinetics and mechanistic insights,
              information that is needed to assess the technical, economic, and environmental
              feasibility of doing acid catalysis in carbon dioxide-enriched high temperature
              water.
