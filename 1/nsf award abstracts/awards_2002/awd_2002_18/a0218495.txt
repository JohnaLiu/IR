Abstract    :
              Fault tolerant protocols are essential for providing various services (routing,
              group communication, broadcasting, multi-casting, etc.) in large, dynamic,
              distributed systems, where both processors and communication links can
              malfunction intermittently.  For example, in mobile and ad hoc networks,  the
              communication links are unreliable and some nodes may be unreachable for
              certain amounts of time. Such networks, consisting of mobile hosts that 
              communicate via wireless radio channels, are being increasingly  used for local
              area networks, law enforcement, military operations and a myriad of other
              applications. 

The traditional approach in designing fault tolerant
              protocols assumes an upper bound on the number of faults and involves a worst
              case design by fault masking.  While this approach
provides 100% system
              availability under assumed conditions, the implementation becomes very
              expensive.  At the same time there are numerous applications for which the lack
              of system availability for very short periods is acceptable. 
              Self-stabilization is an ``optimistic'' model to design 
distributed fault
              tolerant systems; no upper bound on the number of faults is necessary, systems
              always reach a legitimate global state starting from any arbitrary (possibly
              illegitimate) state, and no central control is needed.  However, system
              availability is not guaranteed during  the convergence period.

This research
              addresses the design and analysis of fault tolerant self-stabilizing protocols
              for global communication primitives for dynamic distributed systems, especially
              suitable for mobile ad hoc networks. The research focuses on several
              aspects:

-- Create paradigms and guiding principles for designing
              self-stabilizing distributed algorithms;
-- Explore methodologies for
              translating a conventional algorithm into a self-stabilizing analog;
--
              Discover and analyze self-stabilizing protocols for global communication
              primitives (resource center location, leader election, etc.) in a network;
--
              Explore fractional (rational) valued self-stabilizing algorithms as a way to
              obtain improved approximate solutions to otherwise NP-hard problems;
--
              Measure the degree to which self-stabilizing algorithms can contain a single
              fault.

The research takes a combined theoretical and experimental approach,
              and applies its results to emerging distributed applications for ad hoc
              networks.
