Abstract    :
              The primary coupling between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere is
              accomplished via electric currents flowing along the Earth's magnetic field. 
              Upward current regions generally result from downward flowing electrons which
              have been observed with many satellites.  In contrast, downward current regions
              generally involve upward flowing electrons that have been more difficult to
              observe.  Thus our outstanding of the downward current regions has lagged
              behind our understanding of the upward current regions.  This study will
              develop a self-consistent picture of the plasma and field properties of
              downward auroral current regions.  The results will lead to a better
              understanding of such features as ion conic particle distributions, downward
              pointing electric fields and ELF/VLF turbulence.  The theoretical underpinning
              of the study will be to break the problem into two separate but coupled
              problems with vastly different time scales.  ELF/VLF turbulence operates on
              times scales of milliseconds, while the evolution of the large-scale auroral
              current structures takes place on time scales of minutes to hours.  Thus a
              self-consistent high frequency spectrum can be determined in the context of a
              slowly evolving background distribution.
