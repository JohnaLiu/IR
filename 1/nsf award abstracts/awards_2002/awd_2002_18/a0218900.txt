Abstract    :
              The investigators are planning to determine the nature of interplanetary cosmic
              electrons by measuring the spectra of electrons (negatrons and positrons) in
              the nearly unexplored energy range from 50 MeV to 500 MeV at the time of the
              next solar minimum period.  The main effort is to develop a lightweight balloon
              borne instruments capable of a long-duration (20-30 day) flight from McMurdo
              Station, Antarctica.  Such a flight is also capable of examining variations in
              time of the relative abundance of positrons over a complete solar rotation. 
              Electrons between 50 MeV and 500 MeV probe both large scale and turbulent
              structures in the solar wind on length and time scales not accessible when only
              ions are measured.
