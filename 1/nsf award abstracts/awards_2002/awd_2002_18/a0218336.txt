Abstract    :
              An innovative light source is assembled.  The source consists of an ultrafast
              laser, a highly nonlinear fiber, and a highly dispersive fiber connected in
              series.  It is robust, portable and "wavelength-agile", scanning through a 1200
              nanometer range of wavelengths in 3 microseconds.  It will be applied to
              studies in high-pressure combustion, measurements of fluid fuels, and
              development of new sensors.  It will also be incorporated into existing
              advanced laboratory courses.
