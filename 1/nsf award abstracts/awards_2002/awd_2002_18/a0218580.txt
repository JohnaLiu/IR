The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) is an
              international project to assess the likely impacts of climate change on the
              physical, biological, and human systems of the Arctic.  This workshop provides
              an opportunity for international collaboration in assessing the impacts on
              human systems.  The workshop, called "Snowchange," will bring together
              researchers and indigenous persons from Russia, Canada, and the Nordic
              countries to discuss climate change, its causes, and its significance for
              Arctic residents.  The workshop will identify Russian case studies for the ACIA
              with regard to indigenous perspectives on climate change.
