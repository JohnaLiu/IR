The proper development of the nervous system is essential to
              the f unction of any organism. The nervous system integrates sensory input,
              coordinates motor output, controls autonomic functions, and shapes memory and
              cognition. To accomplish these tasks, the nervous system employs billions of
              neurons that will form trillions of connections with their appropriate targets.
               For  example, in the olfactory system, odorant in the environment are detected
              by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) located in the nose. 
In order for odorant
              information to be properly transmitted to the brain, however, these neurons
              must be connected, or "wired together," with their appropriate partners in the
              brain. How this critical feat of pathfinding and target recognition is
              accomplished is still largely unknown.  In one model, this process is mediated
              b cues  located at various points within the brain that would interact  with
              and guide neurons to  their target.  These cues would form, in essence, a
              "roadmap", that would help guide neurons to their target.
In this proposal, we
              will combine bioinformatics, statistical methods, and genomics to begin to
              determine the shape of this map. As a model system, we will study the ability
              of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) to identify their targets in the olfactory
              bulb.
