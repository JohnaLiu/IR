Abstract    :
                   This research project addresses the gap in the understanding of the
              polyhedral (geometric) structure of general mixed-integer programming problems.
               With an ultimate goal of developing efficient and effective cutting plane
              procedures for mixed-integer problems with general integer variables, strong
              cutting planes applicable to general mixed-integer problems will be identified
              through polyhedral analysis of fundamental single-constraint mixed-integer
              sets. The methods of the research are based on a recent work on sequence
              independent lifting of valid inequalities through the use of superadditive
              functions for general mixed-integer programming.
     The expected outcome of
              this research project is novel cutting plane procedures that will be
              incorporated in branch-and-cut algorithms for solving large-scale mixed-integer
              programming problems. If successful, the research project may lead to
              significant advances in the understanding of general mixed-integer polyhedra
              and in the solution methods for large-scale instances of mixed-integer problems
              with general integer variables.
