Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

The Natural Hazards Research and Applications Information Center at
              the University of Colorado in Boulder has served as a national and
              international clearinghouse for research data on natural disasters, related
              technological events, and programs to reduce damages from them since 1976. 
              This proposal requests renewal of support for the Center for the two-year
              period from October 2002 through September 2004.  While the Center's basic
              activities will not changer significantly, they will be adjusted to reflect the
              new challenges facing the hazard community in the 21st century.  The Center
              will continue to monitor and disseminate hazards research information to
              multiple users.  Furthermore, it will publish and distribute the Natural
              Hazards Observer to over 15,000 subscribers six times a year, operate the
              electronic Disaster Research newsletter, and disseminate information via the
              World Wide Web and traditional hard copy publications.  The Center will
              continue to co-sponsor the Natural Hazards Review journal with the American
              society of civil Engineers and produce the Natural Hazards Information
              publication series.  It will continue to build its library database as well as
              upgrade the system it uses to put the database on the Web.  In July of 2003 and
              2004, the Center will sponsor an annual national and international workshop
              involving hazards researchers and practitioners.  Also, the Center will provide
              travel grants to social scientists to conduct "quick response" studies of
              specific hazard events in the immediate post-disaster period, while
              simultaneously facilitate a conversation to explore the need for the United
              States to establish a more systematic approach to "quick response" research
              following major urban disasters.  The Center's in-house research program will
              focus in two directions.  First, it will develop a program to sponsor
              competitive dissertation grants for new scholars of hazards and risk.  Second,
              research will continue to questions identified in Disasters by Design:  A
              Reassessment of Natural Hazards in the United States (Mileti and others, 1999).
