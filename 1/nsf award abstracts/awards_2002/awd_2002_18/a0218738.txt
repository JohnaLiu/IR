Abstract    :
              This proposal presents a visual approach to the representation and validation of
              document structures specified in XML and transformation of one structure to
              another, in a general framework of automatic language generation. The
              underlying theory of this visual approach is a context-sensitive graph grammar
              formalism. The proposal demonstrates the conciseness and expressiveness of the
              graph grammar formalism and its suitability to visual specification and
              automatic generation of visual XML languages. 

The PI's previous research on
              the graph grammar formalism and visual language generation will be extended and
              adapted to suit automatic generation of visual XML design languages with tools
              that assist the design of XML-like of documents and their translations between
              each other. A set of tools will be developed to facilitate the visual
              specification of XML-like document structures and automatic generation of
              target documents. The tools would therefore enable a wide community to use the
              latest computing and Internet technology in storing and exchanging digital
              documents. The tools and the concepts associated with them will also make
              excellent teaching and self-training vehicles for the courses on programming
              languages, compilers, and visual interfaces.
