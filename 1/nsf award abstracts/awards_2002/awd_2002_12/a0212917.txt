The main objectives of the proposed research are to determine
              Holocene migration lags of western
hemlock and western redcedar in the
              interior Pacific Northwest and to examine the relative importance of climatic
              change,dispersal limitation,and stand-level invasibility as controls of
              migration. These two species currently co-dominate late-successional forests in
              a coastal distributional range and an interior distributional range separated
              by a >160-km wide dispersal barrier of semi-arid grassland and pine forest.
              Preliminary data suggests that invasion of these species into the interior
              range lagged behind the establishment of suitable climatic conditions by >3000
              years, longer than any migration lag hypothesized by previous studies. This
              possibility stands in sharp contrast to the inference from several decades of
              paleoecological studies in the coastal range that migration lags were generally
              unimportant in the heterogeneous landscapes of the Pacific Northwest where most
              species arrived shortly after deglaciation. Because of the dearth of
              paleoecologic and paleoclimatic data from the interior range, however, it
              remains uncertain to what extent the range expansion of hemlock and cedar into
              the interior lagged behind climatic change to suitable conditions and how
              climatic constraints, dispersal limitation, and stand-level invasibility
              affected their expansion. 

To address the research objectives, this study
              will employ a suite of paleoecologic tools and state-of-the-art paleoclimatic
              methods to reconstruct vegetation, fire disturbance, and climate at three pairs
              of sites across a latitudinal gradient in the interior range. Specifically,
              sediment cores from these sites will be analyzed for pollen,lignified
              stomata,wood fibers,and plant macrofossils to detect range expansion of hemlock
              and cedar at three spatial scales (between the coastal and interior ranges,
              within the interior range, and arrival adjacent to lakes).Macroscopic-charcoal
              analysis of these sediment cores will be used to identify fire events and
              assess the effect of fire on stand invasibility.Reconstructions of effective
              moisture and growing-season temperature will be made from oxygen-isotope and
              trace-element analyses as well as diatom and midget
              ransfer-functions.Chronological controls will be based on AMS 14 C dates of
              plant macrofossils,ages of tephra layers,and 210 Pb dates of bulk
              sediments.These results will be
integrated to quantify migration lags of
              hemlock and cedar and assess various scale-dependent migration controls.

To
              our knowledge,this is the first comprehensive paleoecological study using
              independent measures of vegetation,disturbance,and climate to address the
              relative roles of dispersal limitation,stand-scale invasibility,and climatic
              constraints during range expansion.This project will result in a large
              multi-proxy data set relevant for understanding future range shifts on the
              fragmented landscapes of the northern temperate regions.Evidence of a large
              migration lag at the inter-range scale would suggest that long-distance
              dispersal events occur infrequently,and thus range shifts at similar scales
              during anticipated climatic change may be constrained by limited long-distance
              dispersal.In contrast,evidence of climatic limitation (i.e.,no migration
              lag)would imply that the relatively small-magnitude changes toward cooler and
              wetter climatic conditions in the last 4000-2000 years were necessary for the
              invasion of hemlock and cedar into the interior range,and thus these forests
              will be vulnerable to future warming. Contrasting migration lags across the
              coastal and interior ranges and within the interior range should offer insights
              into the patterns of plant migration in highly fragmented landscapes versus in
              the absence of a dispersal barrier.At the local scale,evidence for
              fire-mediated invasion would show that stand-scale invasibility is an
              additional important mechanism controlling the range expansion of these
              species.This multiple-proxy/multiple-scale approach represents a significant
              advance in interpreting Holocene records of plant migration.
