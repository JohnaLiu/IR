Abstract    :
              Shaul Mukamel of U. Rochester and Rudy Marcus of Caltech are supported by the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program for a Summer School for
              graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, where instructors will lecture on
              many-body techniques in chemical physics.  The 12-day school will be
              administered through the Gordon Research Conference office.  Lectures will
              emphasize physically motivated approximations, connections to current
              experiments, and transferability of mathematical methods to other, quite
              different problems.

The main goals of the school are to expose students to
              tutorials in targeted subdisciplines of chemical physics, familiarize them with
              state-of-the-art techniques in greater depth than normal course work, and allow
              them to become acquainted with peers at other institutions at the early stages
              of their careers.
