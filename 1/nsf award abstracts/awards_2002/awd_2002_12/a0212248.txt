Abstract    :
              A grant has been awarded to Dr. Annalisa Berta at San Diego State University
              to
support a collaborative project involving museum and university scientists
              in the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships among fossil and living
              species of baleen whales. Both anatomical and molecular data sets will be
              employed and the results of separate and combined analyses of these data sets
              explored. This study will add considerable new anatomical information from
              fossil baleen whales (especially characters from the skull and jaws) examined
              in various museum collections in the US, Europe, Australasia, and Japan. This
              framework will then be used to interpret the development of the unique filter
              feeding specializations of baleen whales, especially the evolutionary
              transition in feeding from tooth-bearing fossil species to baleen-bearing
              modern species.
	Few studies have investigated the interrelationships of
              baleen whales and the results are conflicting. This study will place modern
              baleen whale diversity in a historical context. Study of the past diversity of
              baleen whales in relation to times of global climate change may suggest
              conservation strategies for endangered modern species that may not have
              otherwise been considered.  This project will provide training for both
              undergraduate and graduate students.  Results of the study will be incorporated
              into exhibits about whale evolution planned at the San Diego Museum of Natural
              History.
