Gordon Research Conference

The purpose of
              this grant is for partial support of the Gordon Research Conference
              on
Chemistry at Interfaces to be held 7-12 July 2002 at Connecticut College in
              New London,
Connecticut. The funds requested will be used to encourage wider
              participation in the
conference by young chemical engineering faculty and
              promising graduate students by
providing partial support for travel expenses
              and conference fees.

The program for the conference has four sub-themes: 1)
              Biomolecules at Interfaces, 2)
Self-Assembly at Interfaces, 3) Consequences of
              Colloid Forces and 4) Charge Effects in
Nonaqueous Media. 22 speakers and 20
              discussion leaders have been invited and agreed to participate in the oral
              program. In addition to the invited talks, posters are encouraged
to be
              submitted from all conference participants, especially from those not invited
              to
speak. A 30-minute time slot is included in the morning program each day
              for oral
overviews. The Vice-Chair will select between 3 and 6 posters to be
              summarized orally
each day in this time slot. Full examination of all posters
              will be conducted in each
afternoon's poster session. A final report will be
              prepared and submitted to the National Science Foundation.
