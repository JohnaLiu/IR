Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University
              of Minnesota supports an interdisciplinary research program with over twenty
              faculty participants from the departments of chemical engineering and materials
              science, electrical and computer engineering, physics, and chemistry.
              TheCenter's research is organized into three interdisciplinary research groups
              (IRGs). IRG1, Microstructured Polymers, investigates the use of block
              copolymers to direct the structure and function of microstructured molecular
              materials. IRG 2, Crystalline Organic Semiconductors, is a new effort whose
              goals are to elucidate structure-property relationships and to apply that
              knowledge to the synthesis of new organic semiconductors with enhanced
              performance in field-effect transistors.  IRG3,  Magnetic Heterostructures,
              aims to understand interfacial spin transport, magnetization dynamics, and
              exchange coupling in magnetic heterostructures with well characterized
              interfaces.

The Center's research benefits from extensive materials
              synthesis and characterization facilities that include microscopy, X-ray
              scattering, polymer synthesis, rheology, molecular characterization and tissue
              mechanics.  The MRSEC operates a broad education and outreach program that
              includes summer research fellowships for faculty-student teams from four-year
              colleges, fellowships for individual Native American students, research
              experiences for undergraduates and for teachers. The Center also has an
              extensive industrial partnership program by which member companies participate
              in collaborative research and education efforts with MRSEC faculty
              participants.

Participants in the Center currently include 23 senior
              investigators, 6 postdoctoral associates, 27 graduate students, and 2
              technicians and other support personnel.   Professor Michael D. Ward directs
              the MRSEC.
