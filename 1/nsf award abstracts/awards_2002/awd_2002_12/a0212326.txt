THREE FUNCTIONALLY DISTINCT ADHESIONS IN FILOPODIA

	Filopodia are sensory and motile
              structures, vital for the motility and guidance of growth cones.  Growth cones
              can advance but cannot respond to guidance cues if bereft of filopodia, the
              tips of their filopodia are specialized for signal reception, and adhesion of
              just a single filopodial tip to a cue can alter discrete elements of motility
              as well as axonal trajectory.  Individual filopodia were analyzed with
              correlated optical recording, electron microscopy and immunolabeling, to
              elucidate the role of filopodial adhesions in motility and guidance. 
	We
              report that, contrary to common belief, all substrate adhesions are not created
              equal.  Individual filopodia develop adhesions at three sites, and these
              adhesions differ distinctively in function.  Tip adhesions suffice to signal. 
              Basal adhesions lie at filopodial bases and along internal actin bundles,
              associate with a novel organelle, the "focal ring," and function in filopodial
              emergence and dynamics.  Shaft adhesions lie along filopodial shafts, lack a
              focal ring, and control the extent of lamellar ("veil") advance.  When present,
              shaft adhesions inhibit veil advance.  Veils are unaffected by basal adhesions,
              but stop advancing as they encountered shaft adhesions.  Veils readily advance
              along filopodia lacking shaft adhesions, but not along filopodia displaying
              shaft adhesions.  This relationship is not due to veils removing adhesions as
              they advance.  Reducing adhesion with antibodies decreases the proportion of
              filopodia with shaft adhesions and coordinately increases veil advance.  Of
              particular interest, guidance cues can act by targeting shaft adhesions.  When
              a filopodial tip contacts an inhibitory cue, the signal induces shaft adhesions
              and coordinately abolishes veil advance, whereas contact with a permissive cue
              prohibits shaft adhesions and coordinately promotes veil advance.  Cues that
              target shaft adhesions produce systematic changes in veil advance and thereby
              modulate axonal trajectory.  
	Individual growth cone filopodia thus develop
              three functionally distinct adhesions that can help regulate both motility and
              navigation.  These adhesions also have structural and compositional
              distinctions.  For instance, basal and shaft adhesions differentially associate
              with Rho GTPases, basal adhesions with Rac1 and shaft adhesions with Cdc42.  We
              are currently testing the hypothesis that one way in which Rac1 and Cdc42
              control motility is by selectively inducing adhesions that differ in function.
