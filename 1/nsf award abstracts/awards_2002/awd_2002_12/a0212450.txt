Abstract    :
              This award is to support research that will develop a continuous record of
              glaciation over the last two to three glacial cycles in mid latitude South
              America that can be compared to nearby ice core records and glaciomarine
              sequences.

Field work will be undertaken to map moraines and outwash
              terraces in detail.  Surface exposure dating will be carried out to provide a
              high-resolution chronostratigraphic framework within which paleoclimate data
              can be placed.  Soil analyses will be performed to provide soil-moisture
              history for the region.  Other analyses that will be performed to fine-tune
              exposure surface dating include better estimates of boulder erosion rates, and
              refinement of local production rates for cosmogenic nuclides.
 
The broader
              impacts of this proposed research center on the development of a continuous
              high resolution record of southern hemisphere glaciation.  Successful
              development of this record holds the potential for answering fundamental
              questions regarding synchrony of climate change in the northern and southern
              hemispheres.
