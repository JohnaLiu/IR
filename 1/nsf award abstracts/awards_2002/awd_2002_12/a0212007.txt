Abstract    :
              0212007  Mainelis  The control of airborne microorganisms that are capable of
              causing serious health problems or even death has become a serious concern
              since the recent anthrax spore episode in the United States.  Electric fields
              have been used to kill various bacteria, yeasts and spores in liquids, but have
              not been used to inactivate airborne microorganisms.   This research will
              result in the development of a laboratory test facility for exposure and
              determination of the inactivation efficiency of airborne microorganisms by
              electrical fields of different magnitudes and polarity for different periods of
              time.
Three different microorganisms will be used, one of which is a surrogate
              for anthrax spores i.e. Bacillus subtilis var. niger.
