Abstract    :
              Osmotic stress caused by drought and salinity has been a major selective force
              in plant evolution and an important factor limiting crop productivity. 
              Understanding the mechanisms by which plants detect and respond to osmotic
              stress is important for basic plant biology and for crop improvement.  Previous
              studies suggested that plant adaptation to osmotic stress is governed by a
              complex network of regulatory pathways, but most of the key components in these
              pathways remain to be identified.  This project continues previous effort in
              using Arabidopsis mutants to identify such regulatory components.  Several
              Arabidopsis mutants impaired in osmotic stress-responsive gene expression were
              recovered from a genetic screen by luciferase imaging using plants that express
              the RD29A-LUC (firefly luciferase under control of the stress-inducible RD29A
              promoter) transgene.  Some of the mutations have been isolated through
              map-based cloning, which provided significant new insights into osmotic stress
              responses in plants.  For example, cloning of SAD1 revealed the involvement of
              RNA metabolism in osmotic stress signaling.  This research is based on such
              findings and is aimed at identifying new regulatory components in osmotic
              stress signal transduction.  Specific aims include the cloning and
              characterization of two new genetic loci involved in osmotic stress signaling,
              and the identification of genetic suppressors of existing mutants such as
              sad1.
