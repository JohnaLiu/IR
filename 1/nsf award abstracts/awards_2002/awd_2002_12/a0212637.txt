The Drosophila wing is an important model for analyzing how
              signaling pathways are coordinated to organize development of a cell field and
              link patterning with growth.  Discovering all the players will be key to a full
              understanding of the processes involved.  Additional genes with wing-enriched
              expression patterns have been discovered by microarray analysis, here a
              functional-genomics approach will be taken to probe the roles of these genes in
              wing development.  Oligonucleotide microarrays were used to identify thirty
              transcripts with four-fold or greater enrichment in the wing versus the body
              wall.  These include genes known to be specifically expressed in the wing (for
              example, nubbin, Distal-less, knot, and bifid).  Here it is proposed to test
              whether uncharacterized transcripts with similar enrichment have functional
              roles in wing development and to analyze how they are regulated by major
              signaling pathways.  The first three objectives relate to this goal.  In the
              first, the functional roles of the wing-enriched genes will be investigated by
              examining phenotypes resulting from ectopic expression and following gene
              silencing.  In the second, the role of the morphogens, Wingless, Hedgehog and
              Decapentaplegic, in controlling the expression of these novel genes will be
              assayed.  In the third, targets of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)
              signaling will be identified by comparing  EGFR mutant wings with wild type
              wings in microarray experiments.  The function of novel targets will be
              investigated.  In the fourth objective, a workshop will be offered for high
              school students to investigate the expression pattern of genes that have the
              potential to encode posterior-specific transcripts.
