Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for the 2002 Gordon Research Conference on
              Correlated Electrons to be held June 29 - July 3 on the Campus of Colby College
              in Waterville Maine.  NSF funds will be used to partially defray the
              registration costs of advanced graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and
              young faculty with no other support. The physics of correlated electrons is
              both rich in basic science challenges and pregnant with possibilities for
              technological impact.  The conference will cover a broad range of topics that
              are among the most active in this field including, superconductivity and
              related properties of two-dimensional electrons in organic-molecule
              field-effect-transistor systems, ferromagnetism in diluted magnetic
              semiconductors and other low-electron-density systems, and new advances in
              experimental and theoretical studies of oxide superconductivity.

This
              award provides partial support for the 2002 Gordon Research Conference on
              Correlated Electrons to be held June 29 - July 3 on the Campus of Colby College
              in Waterville Maine.  NSF funds will be used to partially defray the
              registration costs of advanced graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and
              young faculty with no other means of support. The physics of correlated
              electrons is both rich in basic science challenges and pregnant with
              possibilities for technological impact.  The conference will cover a broad
              range of topics that are among the most active in this field.  Conference
              highlights include reports on the latest advances of efforts to understand
              ferromagnetism in semiconductors, a phenomenon that could enable long-term
              information storage and information processing to occur in the same
              semiconductor device, and reports on superconductivity controlled by gate
              voltages in organic materials, a phenomenon that could lead to room temperature
              superconductivity.
