Abstract    :
                 Biogenic amines are compounds that can act as modulators of nervous system
              function and behavior in vertebrates and invertebrates.  Octopamine is one of
              these, and one of the most widely studied neuromodulators in arthropods.  In
              honeybees, octopamine plays a role in controlling behavioral plasticity. 
              Levels of octopamine are higher in the brains of forager bees that leave the
              hive to get food compared to levels in nurse bees that work inside the hive,
              and treatment with octopamine causes bees to forage precociously.  A particular
              enzyme, tyramine beta-hydoxylase (TbH) is critical for biosynthesis of
              octopamine, so brain levels of octopamine depend at least in part on the
              activity of TbH.  This collaborative project uses molecular, biochemcial and
              behavioral approaches to determine how TbH is regulated by both social and
              endocrine factors.  Enzyme activity, gene expression, and metabolic
              biochemistry clarify how octopamine is synthesized and released in the antennal
              lobes of the brain of honeybees during development of the behavioral change. 
              Results will be important to understanding how an important neuromodulator is
              regulated in the context of behavioral plastiticty and in socially regulated
              gene expression.
   This work will have impact beyond neuroendocrinology to
              animal behavior and to agricultural applications.  There is also an important
              component of student training at the predominantly undergraduate institution
              involved in the collaboration.
