Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to study protein and enzyme dynamics and
              function using optical single-molecule detection and spectroscopy with in vitro
              and in vivo techniques.  The central goals of this research are to utilize
              diffraction-limited confocal, total internal reflection, and wide-field
              epifluorescence optical microscopy and spectroscopy to attack three primary
              thrust areas:  (a) characterization and understanding of the photophysical
              behavior of several red-emitting autofluorescent proteins at the
              single-molecule level, proteins which are key elements in a wide array of in
              vivo cellular labeling and gene expression studies,  (b) development of
              reliable and reproducible methods for specific surface attachment of functional
              proteins to transparent surfaces, so that unwanted proteins do not stick to the
              surface in single-molecule studies, and (c) extension of recent success in
              observing single transmembrane proteins in living cells to establish new
              methods and protocols for observing single molecules in vivo.  In all of these
              studies, the fact that individual copies of proteins will be studied, one at a
              time, provides an additional critical source of information about the presence
              and extent of heterogeneity in these complex systems.

To accomplish these
              ends, physical, chemical, and optical expertise will be combined with the
              molecular biological and biochemical expertise of several collaborators. Owing
              to its multidisciplinary organization, the fundamental research in this program
              will not only generate new knowledge about the biophysical properties of
              important protein systems, but, in addition the advances in instrumentation
              will provide novel groundwork for technology transfer to other relevant
              disciplines. Furthermore, the increased knowledge about both optically driven
              and spontaneous changes in the emissive state of fluorescent proteins may lead
              to design of mutants with improved properties for application in biology and
              other fields.  At the same time, the broadly-based multidisciplinary
              environment which has been assembled to perform this research will provide
              excellent training and education opportunities for the next generation of
              biophysical scientists. This project is supported by the Molecular Biophysics
              Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the
              Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Divisions of Physics and Chemistry
              in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.
