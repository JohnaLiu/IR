Abstract    :
              This project involves a three-year laboratory study on the nature of organic
              aerosol surfaces in the presence of water vapor. Laboratory studies will be
              used to quantify uptake parameters for several species at the gas/liquid
              interface. The techniques to be used include: a) a droplet train fast flow
              reactor, b) a bubble train reactor, and c) an aerosol mass spectrometer
              kinetics apparatus. These techniques make it possible to extract basic
              quantitative information necessary for modeling heterogeneous/multiphase
              interactions of gas phase species with atmospheric droplets and aerosols. This
              effort will improve understanding of heterogeneous chemical processes that take
              place on the surface of atmospheric aerosols and contribute to understanding
              the influence of atmospheric aerosols on human health and climate. Through REU
              supplements to this award, undergraduate students will have opportunities to
              participate in the research.
