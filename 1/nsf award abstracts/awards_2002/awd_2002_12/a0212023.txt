Ordinary statistical methods cannot be used to study variation
              or correlations among species because the fundamental assumption of
              independence of observations is violated due to the pattern of similarity
              expected as a result of their common evolutionary history. This project is
              concerned with the development and evaluation of special statistical methods
              that can be used to take this dependence into account. Work is proposed on
              generalized least-squares models, mixed effects models, generalized linear
              models (using extensions for non-independent data), and generalizations for the
              analysis of multivariate data (especially for suites of shape variables
              obtained from geometric morphometric studies).  Generalizations to models of
              reticulated evolution and geographic sampling will also be investigated.  These
              methods will be applied to several data sets in order to evaluate their
              usefulness in practice.
Support for a graduate student is included in the
              project, along with enhancements to software programs that the Principal
              Investigator has made available for many years to the science community.
