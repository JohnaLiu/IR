Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for the 2002 Gordon Research Conference:
              Research at High Pressure, June 23-28, Kimball Union Academy, Meriden, NH. 
              This interdisciplinary Conference addresses new developments in fields such as
              physics, chemistry, earth and planetary science, materials science, and
              biology.  Recent advances in high-pressure methods have led to the creation of
              new materials, and to opportunities to study physical, chemical and biological
              processes under high-pressure conditions.  The Conference will feature invited
              talks in exciting new areas such as shock wave techniques, materials syntheses,
              high pressure liquids, nanomaterials, high pressure biochemistry, sampling the
              deep Earth, new synchrotron and neutron experiments, high-pressure
              superconductivity, and new metallic behavior at high pressure.  Opening and
              closing sessions will feature provocative talks to provide challenges and
              opportunities for theory and experiment in high pressure research.  The NSF
              funding will facilitate participation by students and junior scientists, as
              well as "newcomers" to the high-pressure field.  The Conference is supported by
              the Condensed Matter Physics Program, the Solid State Chemistry Program, and
              the Petrology and Geochemistry Program.
