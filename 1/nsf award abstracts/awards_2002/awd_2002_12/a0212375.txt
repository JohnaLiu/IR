Abstract    :
              
In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division and the Solid State Chemistry Program of the Division of
              Materials Research, Nelson will conduct research in time resolved optical
              spectroscopy and coherent optical control of condensed matter systems.  The
              complex dynamics of disordered and partially disordered materials will be
              studied over time scales ranging from femtoseconds to milliseconds. 
              Supercooled glass-forming liquids and ferroelectric crystals, both of which
              exhibit complex dynamical behavior that changes sharply as a function of
              temperature, will be investigated.  Novel methods for far-infrared, or
              terahertz (THz) frequency spectroscopy, as well as automated methods for
              spatiotemporal femtosecond pulse shaping will be exploited for generating
              intense, focused THz beams with field levels exceeding 2 MV/cm. 

This
              research is concerned with the complex dynamical behavior of condensed matter,
              mainly solids, ferroelectric media and supercooled liquids.  Novel high
              frequency infrared methods, including terahertz echoes will be developed.  The
              work has the potential of leading to practical devices.  Students and
              postdoctoral research associates participate in this research.  Nelson will
              also conduct an ambitious outreach program to bring research experiences in
              physical chemistry/chemical physics to secondary school students
