Abstract    :
              Understanding quantitatively how environmental changes cause selection and
              evolution is a fundamental challenge for evolutionary biology.  We are now in a
              position to address a variety of fundamental questions about how changes in
              weather and climate determine selection and evolution.  Is selection in the
              field primarily due to infrequent exposures to extreme (hot or cold)
              temperatures, or is the frequency of average temperature conditions more
              important?  How does geographic variation in the thermal environment generate
              differences in selection and evolutionary divergence in traits of organisms
              that depend on temperature? Can we predict quantitatively  how alterations in
              the thermal environment, such as those due to climate warming, will alter
              selection and evolutionary responses?  To address these questions, the proposed
              studies will use laboratory and field experiments to test predictions of a
              quantitative, mathematical model describing selection and evolution.  Our
              studies use temperature effects on growth rate in Pieris rapae (Imported
              Cabbageworm) caterpillars as a model system;  this species has experienced a
              world-wide expansion of its geographic range during the past 200 years, and is
              now an important agricultural pest in some regions.
