Abstract    :
              Brian Gibney of Columbia University is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic,
              and Organometallic Chemistry program for research on de novo design and
              synthesis of metallo-proteins.  Metal-ion binding will be used to initiate a
              'flip' of protein configuration between alternative configurations. Detailed
              study of the characteristics of such synthetic systems will be used to increase
              understanding of factors that control allostery and cooperativity in enzymes,
              hemoglobins, and other important biologically occurring systems. 

An
              already-characterized four-helix bundle scaffold will be used to develop a
              protein that binds two metal centers (a heme and a Zn(II) center) in a
              cooperative fashion.  Completion of this phase of the work will confirm that
              allostery can be used to design and synthesize functional proteins.
              Chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques will be used for separations and
              characterization of products. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)
              experiments, as well as X-ray crystallography, will be used to determine such
              structural information as distances between protein loop regions. Kinetic
              studies and ligand-binding investigations will be carried out to support the
              main research effort.  Understanding gained in this project has potential
              utility in design and fabrication of ultra-small mechanical switches that would
              be highly useful in biological and/or information-processing applications.
