Partial support is provided for the 2002 biannual Gordon Research
              Conference on Ttibology.  The conference will be held August 4-9 at Roger
              Williams University in Bristol, Rhode Islans.  Session topics are focused on a
              general physics theme of "paths of least resistance".  Topics include friction,
              lubrication and wear mechanisms, as well as the role of surface science and
              advanced modelling.  The Gordon Conference format will assure that cutting edge
              research is discussed extensively in an informal atmosphere.  NSF support will
              be used primarily to support the attendance of graduate students and junior
              researchers.  The outcomes of the conference will be advances in basic science
              and follow-on impact on industrial applications in this important area as
              results transfer to industry.
