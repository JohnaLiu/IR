Abstract    :
              The project will advance the understanding and modeling of Madden-Julian
              Oscillation (MJO) variability in the tropics from numerical experiments with a
              regional model and coordinated diagnostic studies.  The experiments are
              designed to test various hypotheses for MJO genesis, particularly those related
              to internal mechanisms and specific boundary forcing.  The focus will be on
              initiation and development of intra-seasonal convection over the equatorial
              Indian and western Pacific ocean basins.  Drs. Weare and Chen (University of
              California, Davis) will conduct a suite of numerical experiments with regional
              models (MM5, WRF) in which boundary conditions can be manipulated to
              selectively suppress one or more of the hypothesized mechanisms.  The PIs
              expect comparisons of "control" and "perturbed" simulations of 20-70 day
              variability to reveal the dominant mechanism of MJO development in both normal
              and ENSO climate conditions.  Simulation of MJO variability poses a great
              challenge:  The state-of-the-art atmospheric GCMs and coupled climate models
              (e.g., NCAR's Community Atmospheric Model and Community Climate System Model)
              are presently unable to simulate this phenomenon and its tropical and
              midlatitude impacts.  The project will thus lead to greater understanding and,
              potentially, more accurate modeling of MJO variability, and its influence on
              long-term weather and seasonal-to-interannual climate variability.
