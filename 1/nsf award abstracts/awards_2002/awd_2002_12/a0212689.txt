Abstract    :
              

The ribosome is a large (2.5 MDa) macromolecular complex made
of RNA and
              protein that is responsible for translation of the genetic
code in all living
              organisms.  Recent progress on the three-dimensional
structure of the ribosome
              has given many new insights regarding the molecular
mechanism of action of the
              ribosome in protein synthesis, including specific
models that explain how
              specific structural features give rise to
specific functions.  This project is
              aimed at testing models for four
functions: (a) discrimination of initiator
              tRNA; (b) the role of protein
S7 in E-site function; (c) the role of
              intersubunit bridges in translocation
of tRNA; and (d) the mechanism of
              unwinding of mRNA secondary structure
by the ribosome.  These models will be
              tested by introducing mutations
in critical elements of ribosomal proteins
              and/or ribosomal RNA that are
proposed to be involved in these functions,
              followed by in vitro and/or
in vivo functional assays.
