Abstract    :
              The use of transition metals in organic synthesis forms the rationale and
              unifying concept for this project.  The foci of this research are threefold. 
              First, the regioselective reactions of pi-allyl Pd complexes will be studied;
              second, the template-enhanced asymmetric synthesis of the natural product
              ophiobolin-C will be carried out and third, the asymmetric synthesis of
              magellanine will be accomplished using Pauson-Khand cycloaddition methodology. 
              

With this proposal, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is
              supporting the research efforts of Dr. Marie E. Krafft of the Department of
              Chemistry at Florida State University.  Professor Krafft will focus her work on
              developing new organometallic reactions which can be used to carry out
              selective carbon-carbon bond forming reactions and to apply the methodology
              towards the synthesis of natural properties having interesting biological
              properties.  The work has broader impact on the pharmaceutical and agricultural
              industries and the project provides an excellent training ground for
              undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral collaborators.
