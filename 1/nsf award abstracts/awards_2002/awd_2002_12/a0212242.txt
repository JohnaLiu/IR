Abstract    :
              The vast majority of caterpillars feed on a narrow range of plants, often within
              only a single family.  Among the distinguishing characteristics of such
              specialized feeders are enzymatic detoxification systems, including cytochrome
              P450 monooxygenases, that are ideally configured for metabolizing the toxins
              that typify their hostplants.  The tiger swallowtail (Papilio glaucus) and its
              relatives, however, are exceptional among caterpillars in that they can feed on
              a much broader range of plant families.  In doing so they encounter a
              substantially greater diversity of plant toxins, which differ in their
              biosynthetic origin and structure. This project is aimed at determining how the
              biochemistry and molecular biology of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases of the
              tiger swallowtail and its generalist relatives differ from the P450 systems in
              their specialized relatives in the genus Papilio.  Most  Papilio species are
              specialized for feeding on plants containing toxins called furanocoumarins, and
              these species rely on P450s in the CYP6B family for detoxification.  Although
              they rarely encounter them, tiger swallowtails can metabolize these compounds
              too, albeit at lower rates.  In this project, differences in the structure and
              regulation of the CYP6B genes will be mapped within the genus Papilio (1) in
              order to understand how generalized habits can arise within specialized
              lineages and (2) to determine how P450 evolution can contribute to changes in
              detoxification capabilities.
