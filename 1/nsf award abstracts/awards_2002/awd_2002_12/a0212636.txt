Abstract    :
              Aquatic ecosystems are threatened by over enrichment with nitrogen (N) and
              phosphorus (P).  For unclear reasons, P enrichment generally has the greatest
              impact in freshwater while N enrichment has the greatest impact in saltwater. 
              The goal of this study is to understand how the biogeochemistry of N and P
              change along the transition from freshwater to saltwater in an estuary.  The
              project will measure inputs and removals of N and P along the salinity
              transition of the Patuxent River estuary, investigate the importance of
              watershed-derived particulate P, and test hypotheses about interactions of N,
              P, iron and sulfur cycles. Transformations and releases of N and P will be
              measured by incubating sediment cores from along the salinity gradient.  The
              mechanisms of salinity effects will be investigated by experimentally altering
              concentrations of seawater, sea salts, sulfate, and nitrate over incubated
              cores.  The results will help guide nutrient management in coastal
              ecosystems.
