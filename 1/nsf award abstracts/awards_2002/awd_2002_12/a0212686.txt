Abstract    :
              
Currently, there is not enough good data on what types of genetic 
changes
              occur when organisms evolve an adaptation.  This data can 
only come from
              high-resolution genetic analyses of natural 
adaptations.  The fruitfly,
              Drosophila sechellia, is uniquely suited for 
such an analysis as it can be
              manipulated genetically and has an 
indisputable adaptation.  A close relative
              of D. melanogaster, a 
genetic model species, D. sechellia has adapted to
              consuming the 
fruit of Morinda citrifolia, a fruit that is toxic to other
              fruitflies.  The first 
two experiments in this grant are in-depth genetic
              analyses of D. 
sechellia's adaptation.  The genes involved in this adaptation
              will be 
precisely mapped and their effects estimated. This data is a
              
necessary first step towards the identification and cloning of the 
adaptive
              alleles.  The final experiment will determine the relative 
importance of
              standing genetic variation versus new mutations in the 
evolution of an
              adaptation by artificially evolving resistance in related 
species of
              fruitflies.
The proposed research will help us understand how organisms
              
genetically change in response to environmental change. 
Specifically, this
              grant will impact our understanding of how insects 
evolve resistance to plant
              produced pesticides and will give insight 
into how insects choose the plants
              upon which they feed.
