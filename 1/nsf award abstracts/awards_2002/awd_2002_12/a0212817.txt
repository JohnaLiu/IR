Studies on locomotion concern the mechanisms and
              systems associated with initiation and generation of movement in animals. The
              nervous system controls locomotion through neural networks that can be compared
              to computer circuits. Unlike computer circuits, neural networks exhibit a
              plasticity to adjust functionally so they can speed up or slow down in
              different behavioral situations. It is believed that movements would look
              robot-like without such plasticity. Neuromodulators such as the biogenic amine
              serotonin (5-HT) participate in maintaining the plasticity of neural networks.
              The specificity of 5-HT actions is based on the expression of seven 5-HT
              receptor subtypes in the cell membrane of individual neurons throughout the
              nervous system. 

A zebrafish 5-HT2-like receptor was cloned and its role in
              the locomotion of zebrafish larvae will be explored. The zebrafish, Danio
              rerio, has become an attractive animal model for studies on locomotion because
              this fish exhibits simple motor patterns and has a simple nervous system.
              Activity of multiple neurons can be monitored in intact animals using optical
              recording techniques. Moreover, mutants can be generated and molecular tools
              such a genome map and database are available. However, the 5-HT system in the
              zebrafish is not well understood. As outlined in this proposal, mapping of the
              expression of the new zebrafish 5-HT receptor in the brain and spinal cord,
              pharmacological characterization of the zebrafish 5-HT receptor, and
              identification of 5-HT receptor expressing neurons in the pectoral fin motor
              pathway of zebrafish larvae will allow the construction of a model for the
              function of 5-HT receptors on the generation of pectoral fin movements. These
              studies will contribute to a better understanding of mechanisms underlying the
              orchestration of neuronal activity in a simple vertebrate brain.
