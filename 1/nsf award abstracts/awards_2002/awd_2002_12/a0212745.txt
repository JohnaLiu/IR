Abstract    :
                         Long-chain fatty acids are important substrates for energy production
              and macromolecular biosynthesis and are important regulatory molecules. The
              transport of fatty acids into the cell represents an important metabolic
              process common to most bacterial and animal systems.  The most well understood
              fatty acid transport process is found in the gram-negative bacterium bacteria,
              Escherichia coli.  In E. coli, long-chain fatty acids are taken up by a process
              that is linked to utilization and fatty acid-dependent gene expression.  This
              process requires the fatty acid transport protein FadL and the enzyme fatty
              acyl CoA synthetase (FACS).  FadL functions to move fatty acids across the
              outer membrane while FACS activates these compounds for further metabolism
              rendering this process unidirectional.
        
        The technical and
              scientific significance of this work is several-fold.   First, it will define
              how the transport protein FadL is positioned within the membrane.  This
              research will involve modifying the protein for detection and the introduction
              of amino acid substitutions to assess function.  Second, this work will use
              fluorescent techniques to define the activity of FadL using artificial
              membranes.  More specifically, this will involve monitoring the movement of
              fatty acids across membranes containing FadL so that the fundamental properties
              guiding activity can be determined. Third, this work will investigate how FACS
              moves into the membrane, where it activates fatty acids as they are
              transported.  And fourth, we expect to define the structure of FACS to further
              understand how this protein functions in fatty acid transport.

         This
              work is designed to provide fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms
              underpinning the movement of fatty acids across the membrane and how they
              subsequently function as effecter molecules regulating fatty acid responsive
              gene expression.  This experimental system serves as a paradigm for
              understanding this process in other systems, including mammals. In addition,
              this research program will provide a training environment in molecular
              genetics, molecular biology and biochemistry for graduate, undergraduate and
              high school students.
