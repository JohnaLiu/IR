Abstract    :
              A grant has been awarded to Merrill Peterson, Western Washington
University, to
              study the evolution of premating barriers between two
hybridizing beetle
              species.  The research combines lab and field studies to
determine the costs
              of hybridizing across a 75km-wide zone of
hybridization.  In measuring these
              costs, the research will take into
account the degree to which multiply-mating
              females preferentially use
sperm from same-species males, and measure material
              benefits females may
gain from hybrid matings.  This study will also determine
              the balance
between selection against hybridization and the rate of genetic
              exchange
with populations outside of the zone of hybridization, a process that
              will
tend to counter the effects of selection.
	This research program will
              address long-standing questions
regarding the evolution of reproductive
              barriers between species, using a
novel geographic perspective.  In so doing,
              it will provide answers to
fundamental questions in speciation research.  The
              grant will also support
the training and mentorship of underrepresented
              undergraduates through a
summer internship program, Minority Opportunities for
              Research on Evolution
(MORE).  Participants in MORE will get hands-on
              experience and training for
careers in biological research.
