One of the central problems in evolutionary biology is to
              understand the processes that lead to new species. This project will determine
              whether and how the coevolutionary arms race between red crossbills and
              lodgepole pine is leading to new species of red crossbills (finch-like birds).
              First, mark-and-recapture methods will be used to determine whether natural
              selection as a result of coevolution has caused the observed morphological
              divergence between crossbill populations. Second, aviary experiments and field
              studies will address how reproductive isolation (i.e., speciation) might have
              occurred as a by-product of divergent selection. Finally, genetic studies using
              AFLP primers will be used to determine the extent of genetic differentiation
              between different crossbill populations and to develop a phylogeny of all North
              American red crossbills. 

This work aims to link two of the most important
              evolutionary processes, coevolutionary arms races and speciation, to patterns
              of biodiversity and to how geographic patterns of diversity arise. Being able
              to document such coevolutionary interactions, with the real possibility that
              they are now contributing to the origin of new species, is not only exciting,
              but may also provide insights that will help prevent undesirable extinctions.
              Such interactions have rarely been well documented for any taxa, let alone for
              birds, which capture the attention of many citizens.
