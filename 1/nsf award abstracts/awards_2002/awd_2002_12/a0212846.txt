Abstract    :
              Capsid proteins play many functional roles during the life cycle of viruses,
              including host cell recognition, specific encapsidation of genomic nucleic
              acid, and the formation of the essential interactions required for progeny
              virus capsid assembly and release. For the ssDNA Parvoviridae, the exact role
              of their capsid proteins in these processes requires further elucidation.
              Genetics studies have shown that interaction of the major parvoviral capsid
              protein, VP2, with host cell factors play a crucial role in tissue tropism and
              entry into the host cell. The methodologies of X-ray crystallography,
              biochemistry and virology will be utilized to study two closely related strains
              of minute virus of mice, MVMi (immunosuppressive strain) and MVMp (prototype
              strain) and their interactions with sialic acid, a component of their
              infectious receptor, to gain insights into mechanisms of specificity of capsid
              interactions in virulence determination. In addition, the X-ray structure of
              MVMi, in which approximately 30% of the ssDNA genome is ordered provides a
              unique model for defining molecular interactions between a viral capsid and its
              genome that ensure selective recognition and packaging. The aim is to identify
              a possible genomic signature that drives parvoviral DNA recognition and
              encapsidation. Research developments and achievements will be integrated with
              educational training of senior undergraduate and graduate students in the use
              of a multidisciplinary approach to study macromolecular interactions.
