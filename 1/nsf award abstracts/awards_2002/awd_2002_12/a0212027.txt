Abstract    :
              	Viviparity-live-bearing modes of reproduction, rather than egg-laying-has
              evolved independently in lineages of many animals.  It therefore is a
              consequence of convergent evolution, with the same feature occurring in taxa
              that do not share a common ancestor that bears the trait (homoplasy). 
              Viviparity in amphibians has many different expressions of these independent
              evolutions including retention of the internally fertilized ova in the oviducts
              with our without maternal nutrition after yolk is resorbed, intraoviductal
              cannibalism, retention of externally fertilized ova in the skin of the mother's
              back, and others.  
	This research program will investigate the mechanisms by
              which viviparity has arisen by comparing 1) features of parental ovaries,
              oviducts, and skin with those of related species that are egg-layers to
              elucidate the effects of 'pregnancy' maintenance; 2) patterns of development of
              embryos of taxa with different modes of viviparity and with related egg-laying
              species; 3) modes of retention of the developing embryos, including the
              hormonal substrate as measured morphologically; 4) modes of nutrition of the
              developing young; 5) the features of metamorphosis of the young of viviparous
              species as compared with those of related egg-layers; and 6) length of
              'pregnancy' and the environmental and physiological cues for birth.  The study
              will be one of the first to consider mechanisms by which homoplasy has evolved,
              rather than simply documenting instances of such patterns of evolution.
