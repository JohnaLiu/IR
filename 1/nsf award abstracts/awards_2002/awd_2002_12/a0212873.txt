The ecological communities of organisms found in nature
              have usually been treated as collections of independent species.  However, the
              great advances made recently by phylogenetic biologists in understanding the
              "tree of life" mean that ecologists can now examine the evolutionary
              relationships among the species in their communities.  Knowing this
              phylogenetic structure also enables ecologists to detect the processes
              organizing species membership in the communities, and thus provides a powerful
              new tool to understand species-rich systems.  In the proposed research software
              tools will be developed for assembling and analyzing community phylogenetic
              structure, and will be applied to an endangered, rain forest tree community in
              Borneo, and to the Californian flora.  A comparative survey of the phylogenetic
              structure of other plant communities around the world will also be performed. 
              The proposed research will promote a closer integration of evolutionary biology
              and community ecology.
