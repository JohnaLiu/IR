Abstract    :
              This proposal requests travel funds from the National Science Foundation to help
              fund a focused workshop, to take place in part at the Louisiana State
              University (LSU), and in part at the LIGO Livingston Observatory, to aid in the
              creation of "source working groups" for interferometric gravitational wave
              detectors.
