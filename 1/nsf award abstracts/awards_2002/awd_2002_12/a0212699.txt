Abstract    :
              The research in this project will focus on the preparation and study of azoles,
              primarily pyrazoles and isoxazoles, and pyranones.  For the syntheses, some
              emphasis is placed on multiple anion-type syntheses coupled with standard
              preparative methodology as exemplified by Claisen-type reactions, aldol-type
              reactions and alkylations.  Starting materials will consist of readily
              available ketones, hydrazones and carboxylic acid hydrazides.  Each of the
              projects will be organized into smaller component investigations thereby
              allowing each undergraduate participant to be involved in at least two
              investigations.

With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI)
              award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
              research efforts of Dr. Charles F. Beam and Dr. Jason S. Overby of the
              Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the College/University of
              Charleston.  The principal investigators will focus their work on the
              preparation of heterocycles that have interesting biological activity, that
              have interesting ligand properties and  compounds that are viable ligands for
              the construction of new metallocene derivatives.  The students working in the
              project will have the opportunity to gain from the experience of both an
              organic and an inorganic chemist.
