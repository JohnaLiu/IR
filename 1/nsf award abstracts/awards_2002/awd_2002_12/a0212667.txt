Abstract    :
              A central goal of evolutionary biology is to understand the ways in which
              species become reproductively isolated from one another.  One powerful approach
              to this problem involves the study of naturally occurring hybrid populations. 
              In particular, inferences about the genetics of reproductive isolation can be
              made through the study of differential movement of genes across a hybrid zone
              between two species.  Genes contributing to reproductive isolation are expected
              to move less freely across a hybrid zone than genes that do not contribute to
              reproductive isolation.  The primary objective of the proposed research is to
              assess the number and relative contribution of genes to reproductive isolation
              between two European house mouse species, Mus musculus and M. domesticus, that
              naturally hybridize in central Europe.  Approximately 900 mice from two
              transects across this hybrid zone in Germany will be genotyped for 68 genetic
              markers of known chromosomal location and a statistical analysis of the
              relative movement of these markers across the zone will be made.

Because the
              complete sequence of the mouse genome will be available soon, this research
              will lay the groundwork for identifying specific genes involved in reproductive
              isolation.  The study is both significant and unique in its utilization of a
              vast amount of genetic information to address a fundamental problem in biology,
              that is, the genetic basis of speciation.
