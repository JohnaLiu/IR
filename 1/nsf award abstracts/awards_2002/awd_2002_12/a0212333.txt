Abstract    :
              Undisturbed peatland ecosystems are believed to represent a net sink for
              atmospheric carbon (C).  This research focuses on C balance in western Canadian
              peatlands of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, a region where disturbances,
              especially fire, diminish the regional C sink strength.  In addition to direct
              C losses via combustion, peatlands continue to release C after fire, as peat
              decomposition continues with greatly diminished post-fire net primary
              production of vegetation.  The investigators will examine the effects of
              wildfire on the C balance of peatlands across western Canada.  The research is
              structured around three questions: how do post-fire C fluxes vary spatially and
              temporally across western Canadian peatlands; to what extent is regional
              variation in post-fire C-balance recovery attributable to variation in
              post-fire plant successional pathways; and to what extent is regional variation
              in post-fire C-balance recovery attributable to variation in post-fire plant
              nutrient and moisture conditions in the burned peat substrate?
