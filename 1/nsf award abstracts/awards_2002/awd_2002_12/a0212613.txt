Abstract    :
              The control of reproduction is fundamental to the structure and evolution of
              animal societies.  This project will examine the causes and consequences of
              variation in the breeding structure of colonies of the termite Nasutitermes
              corniger, focusing on the number of reproductive males and females (kings and
              queens) and their apportionment of reproduction.  The wide range of colony
              genetic structures present within natural populations provides opportunities to
              test hypotheses arising from the rapidly growing body of theory on reproductive
              partitioning in social groups.  Nest dissections, behavioral assays, and
              analysis of a highly informative set of genetic markers will determine (1) how
              reproduction is partitioned among co-occurring queens and kings, (2) how colony
              genetic structure affects interactions within and between groups, and (3) how
              colony reproductive characteristics change through time.  

Despite their
              ecological and economic importance, termites are understudied relative to other
              social insects.  Nasutitermes corniger is particularly well suited to the
              proposed research due to its abundance and to the comparative ease with which
              the queens and kings can be collected from mature colonies.  Besides adding to
              knowledge of fundamental aspects of termite biology, this research will
              contribute to the broader understanding of social behavior, reproductive
              competition, and the genetic structure of populations.
