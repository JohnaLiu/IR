Proposal Title: 	The Use of
              Arrays of Sensors and Actuators to Control Convective Flows


The PI and his
              students will undertake a theoretical and experimental study of active control
              of thermally induced convective flows.  Because such flows are nonlinear with
              many degrees of freedom, effective control is quite difficult. The research
              will extend previous work to develop means by which all sensors can interact
              with all the actuators simultaneously. Numerical simulations will be carried
              out to study the dynamics of the controlled system, and experiments will be
              conducted in upright circular cylinders with different aspect ratios, using
              different liquids having a wide range of Prandtl numbers, while employing
              arrays of micro-fabricated sensors and actuators.  This is a fundamental study
              that has the potential of enabling control strategies for modifying transport
              phenomena in significant industrial processes.  The research should also
              facilitate the integration of active control strategies with thermal transport
              into new educational materials.
