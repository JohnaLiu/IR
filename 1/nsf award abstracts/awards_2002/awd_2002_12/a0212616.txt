Description:  This award supports a US-India cooperative
              research project entitled Diagnosis of India's Weather Prediction Model's
              Forecast and Simulation Deficiencies.
US PI Sumant Nigam, University of
              Maryland will collaborate with Indian meteorologists, Shyam Singh, Sarat Kar,
              and Gopal Iyengar of the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting
              (NCMRWF), in New Delhi.  They will test the physics of India's numerical
              weather prediction model by producing multi-year simulations of the past
              climate, using observed lower-boundary conditions.  Analysis of the
              ensemble-mean climate simulation, particularly comparison with the
              corresponding period observations, will allow one to determine the deficiencies
              of the model's physics. 
Improvement in the model's physics will have a
              beneficial impact on climate simulation and on short-to-medium range weather
              forecasts developed by the NCMRWF.   

Scope:  The research goal is to
              diagnose the reasons for deficient weather forecasts produced at the NCMRWF by
              India's only operational numerical weather prediction model.  Consequently,
              successful completion of the research will lead to improved weather forecasts
              in India and better understanding of the observed modes of recurrent
              seasonal-to-interannual variability, particularly during the Indian summer
              monsoon.  There is immense research interest in this topic among monsoon
              meteorologists worldwide.  Beyond the immediate objective of facilitating
              NCMRWF's participation in the international Atmospheric Model Intercomparison
              Project (AMIP), this research will help benchmark the model's performance,
              foster additional analysis of the NCMRWF model integration's, and accelerate
              model development by drawing on the experience of the international
              meteorological community.  This award is jointly supported by the Division of
              International Programs and the Division of Atmospheric Sciences.
