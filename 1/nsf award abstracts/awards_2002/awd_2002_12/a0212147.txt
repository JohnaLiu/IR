Abstract    :
              This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research by Peter T. Wolczanski of Cornell University to study the
              mechanism and thermodynamics of olefin-alkylidine rearrangements catalyzed by
              niobium and tantalum complexes with tris-tertbutyl silicon oxide (silox)
              ligands.  The sulfur analog of silox will be used to explore the secondary
              structures of linked manganese, iron, cobalt and nickel tetrahedra to explore
              bio-inspired organometallic chemistry.  Electronic factors involving
              oxygen-atom transfer are to be explored with silox-rhenium-oxo derivatives. 
              The fundamental coordination and organometallic chemistry of square planar
              tungsten(IV) silox derivatives will be investigated for reactivity parallels
              with d8 complexes in oxidative addition reactions.

Reactions of
              organometallic complexes with silicon-based ligands will be studied to address
              fundamental questions as to how these reactions proceed.
