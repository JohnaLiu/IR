Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will fabricate a
              nanostructured, palm-size gas chromatography (GC) for the in-situ, and low cost
              analysis of volatile chemicals.   Gas chromatography has been widely used as an
              analytical instrument for volatile organic compounds.  The existing GC
              instruments, including the portable ones, have inherent limitations that make
              them unsuitable for the continuous, on-line/in-situ monitoring applications. 
              The proposed program will design and demonstrate a nanotechnology-based
              miniature GC to detect, identify, and quantify chemical pollutants.  The proof
              of principle demonstration is based on an EPA furnished test matrix.

The
              miniature GC is expected to be pocket sized, low power (1-5 W), low cost (<
              $500/unit) and low maintenance.  In addition to the EPA environmental
              monitoring applications, the miniature GC has a variety of other applications
              for DOD, NASA, and other government agencies involve in chemical warning
              medicine, homeland security, and demilitarization and treaty verification.
