Abstract    :
              Nancy Makri at University of Illinois has submitted a renewal proposal to
              develop and apply forward-backward semiclassical dynamics methods for
              large-scale simulations of polyatomic systems.  She proposes to integrate these
              methods with a rigorous path integral description of the Boltzmann density,
              state-of-the-art molecular dynamics techniques for optimal sampling of phase
              space, and on-the-fly ab initio calculations of forces to produce a powerful
              tool suitable for including quantum mechanical effects in simulations with
              hundreds of particles.  Extension to treat exchange effects in bosonic fluids
              is also planned.  Applications will focus on vibrational relaxation in liquids
              and the dynamics of doped helium clusters.

Energy transfer in and out of
              molecular vibrational modes plays an important role in many topics of current
              interest, such as chemical reaction pathways and laser control.  It is clear
              that understanding the mechanism of energy relaxation phenomena in large
              molecules, clusters, or in solution requires a delicate treatment of nonlinear
              many-body interactions and quantum effects, which will be pursued in this
              research effort.
