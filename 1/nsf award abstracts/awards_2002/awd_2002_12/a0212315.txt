Abstract    :
              This project will examine the importance of leaf detritus with differing decay
              characteristics on ecosystem properties in headwater streams that receive most
              of their energy from the surrounding forest as autumn-shed leaves. By
              manipulating the quality and complexity (i.e., number of leaf types) of
              detrital resources, the investigators will test the hypothesis that quality and
              complexity of detritus in a detritus-based ecosystem regulates ecosystem
              structure and function. This will be accomplished by controlling detritus
              persistence and availability to stream-dwelling consumer organisms. Increasing
              the complexity of leaf detritus should reduce temporal variation in key
              ecosystem characteristics and processes such as standing crop of organic
              matter, organic matter export, fungal reproduction, nutrient retention,
              ecosystem metabolism, and invertebrate abundance, biomass and production.
              Anthropogenic reductions in global biodiversity require an improved
              understanding of the impacts of biodiversity on ecosystem processes, such as
              the consequences of different riparian replanting schemes for stream
              ecosystems.
