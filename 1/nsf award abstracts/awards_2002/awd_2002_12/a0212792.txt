Abstract    :
              This study addresses the degree to which the water transport capacity of plants
              limits their productivity.  Specifically, we focus on the hydraulic properties
              of tree stems and branches (the "xylem") in relation to the photosynthetic
              capacity of the leaves.  Our goal is to understand the physiological linkages
              between vascular and photosynthetic capacity.  We have chosen to address this
              fundamental question by examining seasonally dry forest trees.  Our rationale
              for this reflects the important role that seasonal precipitation patterns play
              in determining the longevity and productivity of leaves in these forests.  We
              will monitor the extent to which vascular tissues become damaged during periods
              of low water availability (drought) and the effects that this has on the
              productivity of leaves.  Our study will be one of the first to examine directly
              the link between vascular and photosynthetic capacity in trees.  The results of
              this work will increase our understanding of how plants copy with dramatic
              changes in soil water availability, and will contribute to our knowledge of
              factors influencing the productivity and ecology of seasonally dry tropical
              forests.
