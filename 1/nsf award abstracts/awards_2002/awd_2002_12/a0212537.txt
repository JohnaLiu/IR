Abstract    :
              All habitats rely on the bacterial fixation of atmospheric nitrogen or on the
              synthetic production of nitrogen fertilizers for providing a supply of fixed
              nitrogen.  Some plants have established symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing
              bacteria, and therefore can obtain much of their nitrogen from the atmosphere. 
              One prime example of this relationship is the alfalfa/Sinorhizobium meliloti
              symbiosis.

It is increasingly evident that exopolysaccharides produced by S.
              meliloti play specific roles in the development of the root nodule symbiosis
              between the bacteria and legumes, particularly at the level of nodule invasion.
               The structural specificity and the small amounts of exogenous
              exopolysaccharide necessary to successfully rescue the invasion deficiency of
              S. meliloti exopolysaccharide mutants, suggest that low molecular weight
              exopolysaccharides act as signaling molecules during the invasion process. 
              This work aims to understand the signaling mechanisms that lead to the plant's
              response to exopolysaccharides, and the identification and characterization of
              the putative plant receptors that detect or recognize the presence of the
              exopolysaccharide signals.

The answers to these and related questions will
              lead to a greater understanding of the signaling mechanisms between symbiotic
              partners and may also provide insights into the possible uses of
              oligosaccharides as signaling molecules in other biological systems.
