Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Phase I Project is to develop a bioremediation
              technology for treating groundwater contaminated with N-nitrosodimethylamine
              (NDMA). NDMA is a potent carcinogen and an emerging groundwater contaminant in
              the United States. Accordingly, the State of California has established an
              acceptable level in drinking water for NDMA of only 20 ng/L. Current
              technologies for treating NDMA, such as ultraviolet irradiation and carbon
              adsorption,   are expensive and/or ineffective for removing the contaminant to
              required levels. Envirogen scientists have recently discovered a bacterial
              strain that is capable of metabolizing NDMA during growth on a second substrate
              (i.e., by co-metabolism). This bacterium is one of only a few strains that are
              known to degrade NDMA. In the course of this Phase I  project, the
              biodegradation of NDMA by this organism andby other bacterial strains
              possessing similar broad specificity oxidase enzymes will be examined. The most
              effective culture(s) will be seeded into bioreactors and the abilities of these
              strains to remediate NDMA in groundwater will be quantified. In addition, the
              potential to
stimulate specific microorganisms in contaminated aquifers to
              degrade NDMA by cosubstrate application will be tested.
     The commercial
              application of this project is in the area of wastewater treatment linked to
              municipal drinking water supplies. Additional  industrial and military  uses of
              the core technology are also expected.
