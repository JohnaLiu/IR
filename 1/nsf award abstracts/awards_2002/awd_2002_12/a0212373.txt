Developmental timing is fundamental to all multicellular
              organisms. For tissues and organs to form properly, developmental events must
              occur in the proper succession with the appropriate synchrony. The mechanisms
              that explicitly govern the timing of these events are not well understood in
              any organism. Valuable insights, however, have come from the investigation of
              heterochronic genes of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Dr. Moss will
              investigate an new and important heterochronic gene, lin-46, which helps
              specify the stage-appropriate fates of cells during the animal's larval
              development. The LIN-46 protein acts early in the developmental timing pathway,
              downstream of the key regulators LIN-14 and LIN-28. Proteins related to LIN-46
              in plants and animals are known to mediate protein-protein interactions.
              Therefore, to control developmental timing LIN-46 is likely to interact with
              proteins that coordinate the behaviors of cells and may be regulated by LIN-14
              and LIN-28.

The work outlined in this proposal will address how LIN-46
              governs developmental timing from two aspects. First, Dr. Moss will elucidate
              the molecular relationship between the lin-46 and other heterochronic genes by
              determining whether lin-46 expression is regulated by lin-28 and lin-14,
              whether they act in the same cells, and whether they are in a linear genetic
              pathway. Second he will characterize the interaction of LIN-46 with other
              proteins. He predicts that at least one other protein encoded in the C. elegans
              genome interacts physically with LIN-46 and is necessary for its function. He
              will search for other proteins that interact with LIN-46 using molecular and
              genetic approaches.

The long-range impact of this work will be an
              understanding of the molecular basis of developmental timing regulation by
              LIN-46 and how it has evolved. What is learned about developmental timing in C.
              elegans may be widely applicable to other animals. The process of developmental
              timing is of broad biological interest because its importance in the evolution
              of animal form.
