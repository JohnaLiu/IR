As in all other eukaryotes and prokaryotes, diversification of
              form and function during plant development depends on cell polarity. 
              Relatively little is known in molecular terms about how cells translate
              polarizing cues into localized cytoskeletal assemblies that direct the
              polarization of other cell components or of the cell growth machinery.  With
              the support of a prior NSF award, a genetic approach was taken to analyze
              mechanisms by which maize leaf epidermal cells become polarized, focusing on
              three Brick (Brk) genes required for the polarized growth and division of
              epidermal cells.  Building on this work, studies are proposed here to further
              advance our understanding of plant cell polarity, with the following specific
              objectives:  
1. Complementary approaches will be taken to localize BRK1
              protein in polarizing subsidiary mother cells and expanding epidermal pavement
              cells.  2. Complementary approaches will be taken to identify candidate
              BRK1-interacting proteins and investigate their in vivo interactions with BRK1.
               3. As shown for the Brk genes, two Pangloss (Pan) genes promote the
              polarization of subsidiary mother cells, but are not required for polarized
              cell expansion.  The functions of Pan genes and how they relate to those of Brk
              genes will be further elucidated through phenotypic analysis of single and
              double mutants.  4. To help build a bigger picture of how maize leaf epidermal
              cells become polarized, one additional epidermal cell polarity gene (Pan1,
              Brk2, or Brk3) will be cloned and molecularly characterized by means of
              transposon tagging.  The intellectual merit of the work proposed is augmented
              by the central importance of cell polarity in the development of all eukaryotes
              and prokaryotes, and the fact that BRK1 (and probably the entire pathway in
              which all 3 Brk genes were shown to function) is conserved among eukaryotes. 
              Therefore, our findings will most likely have an impact outside the boundaries
              of plant cell biology.  The broader impact of the work proposed will mainly be
              the education and training of young scientists participating in the research,
              including one postdoc, one Ph.D. student, and a series of undergraduates.
