This research investigates the evolutionary response of
              woodrats to
temperature change over the late Quaternary. The project involves
              work at cave sites in the southwestern United States, using fossilized woodrat
              middens or debris
piles. Middens consist of plant fragments, fecal pellets and
              other
materials embedded in crystalized urine ("amberat"); when sheltered
              in
caves they persist for thousands of years. Measurements of
              radiocarbon-dated
fecal pellets are used to estimate body size; for most
              mammals, size is sensitive to
environmental temperature.  Over the next year,
              we will investigate a
number of potentially problematic sampling and
              statistical dimensions of
our study system, including conducting studies with
              modern animals to
examine midden deposition and composition.

Organisms may
              respond to anthropogenic climate change by adapting or going
locally extinct. 
              However, the timing, magnitude and nature of such
responses remains unclear. 
              The past ten thousand years are arguably the
best proxy we have for
              understanding the likely effects of anthropogenic
climate change.  By
              examining different species of small rodents at
different locations within
              their range over the late Quaternary, and
estimating the thermal thresholds at
              which different types of evolutionary
responses occur, we may be able to
              better understand how future climate
change will impact mammalian
              populations.
