Radiative feedback from massive stars is energetically
              fundamental to galaxy and cosmic evolution, and it also provides essential
              emission-line diagnostics of conditions both locally and in the distant
              universe. Our current limited understanding of radiative feedback greatly
              hampers investigations of present-day local processes as well as of galaxy
              formation and the early universe. Dr. Sally Oey, at Lowell Observatory, will
              carry out a comprehensive investigation of radiative feedback
              processes
ranging from specific nebular ionization conditions to large-scale,
              global ionization processes in galaxies and the intergalactic medium. The goals
              are: 1) To understand specifically how ionizing spectral types and chemical
              abundances affect nebular emission, and to calibrate corresponding nebular line
              diagnostics; and 2) to understand global radiative feedback processes in
              galaxies by investigating large-scale properties of diffuse ionized gas, HII
              region populations, and implications for the escape of ionizing photons from
              galaxies.
