Abstract    :
              This project will combine summative and formative evaluation techniques to apply
              to completed Phase 1 and ongoing Phase 2 Model Institutions for Excellence
              awards. The evaluative study will interpret the quantitative and qualitative
              outcomes and the elements of the program that led to success or failure to
              accomplish the goals of the MIE program. The outcome of the study will be a
              document describing the successes and failures of the MIE projects, the factors
              that led to success and failure, and a summation of the MIE projects that can
              be used to guide other institutions in developing models to increase
              participation of under represented groups in SMET undergraduate and graduate
              programs.  This research will be of value in determining how to assess and
              disseminate successful models that lead to institutional change in promoting
              the participation in SMET careers of under represented groups.
