As the dangers of
              our world become more apparent, and our desire to prepare for them increases,
              there is a
growing need for virtual experiences: simulated environments that
              convey to a participant the sense that they
are in a situation, not just a
              place. A virtual experience can provide an opportunity to explore a situation
              that
is too dangerous to rehearse, too impractical to create, or too
              inconvenient to attend. They may be used for
training, for example to give
              first hand experience to emergency response personnel in directing
              panicked
crowds; for design, for example to determine how people interact with
              a space before it is constructed; or
for entertainment. The key to a virtual
              experience is that they combine environment and situation. Simply
creating a
              visually compelling virtual environment is insufficient.
Our vision is to use
              compelling virtual experiences in training, research and entertainment. To be
              effec-
tive in these applications, virtual environments must be authored to
              meet specific pedagogical and commu-
nicative goals. Realizing this vision,
              therefore, requires technologies for both simulating and rendering the
worlds
              and enabling an author to specify behavior effectively.
