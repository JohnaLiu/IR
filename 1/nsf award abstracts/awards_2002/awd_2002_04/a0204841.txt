Abstract    :
              Roald Hoffmann of Cornell University is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to carry out research that aims to (1) explain
              the electronic structure of molecules, discrete or extended, that present
              puzzles in bonding, (2) develop a qualitative understanding of the chemical
              bonding in important classes of molecules, with a focus on relationships
              between molecular and extended systems, stressing the construction of
              conceptual bridges between organic and inorganic structures, (3) look broadly
              and qualitatively at problems of reactivity on surfaces and at interfaces, (4)
              predict as yet unsynthesized systems with unusual properties, and (5) devise
              further analytical tools for applied quantum chemistry.  The methodology to be
              employed will be quantum mechanical calculations of both qualitative (extended
              Huckel method) and quantitative (density functional theory) reliability, as
              well as the apparatus of perturbation theory for constructing interpretations. 
              Outcomes are expected to provide a wide range of chemists, physicists, and
              materials scientists with the tools to analyze and understand qualitatively
              bonding, structure, and reactivity over a wide range of discrete molecules and
              extended structures. 

Although the computational apparatus of quantum
              chemistry is at a stage where it is possible to attain predictive chemical
              accuracy for medium-sized molecules, there remains a strong need in the
              chemical community for explanations and increased understanding.  These
              explanations represent a portable, qualitative accounting of the factors
              responsible for the structure, energetics, and reactivity of molecules, and are
              the goals of this research.  Such accounting can be couched using chemical
              ideas that are qualitatively useful to the broad scientific community, such as
              electronegativity, orbitals, electrostatics, and steric effects.
