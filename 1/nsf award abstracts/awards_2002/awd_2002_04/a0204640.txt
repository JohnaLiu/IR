Title: Advances in Numerical
              Magnetohydrodynamics - Novel Schemes and Adaptive Mesh Refinement on Structured
              Meshes 

The recent literature has seen an explosion of interest in the field
              of numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). This stems from the fact that robust
              total variation diminishing (TVD) schemes have been formulated and adaptive
              mesh refinement (AMR) techniques have been designed. The MHD equations evolve
              the magnetic field in divergence-free fashion and this divergence-free
              evolution is essential for physically consistent computation of the MHD system.
              The ideal MHD schemes that have been formulated have second order accuracy. In
              this project we focus on the formulation of second order accurate methods for
              resistive MHD on AMR meshes. The work will rely on the use of Krylov subspace
              techniques.

The equations of resistive magnetohydrodynamics are used in
              various settings in physics, astrophysics and engineering. They are useful for
              advanced methods for rocket propulsion as well as in nuclear fusion-based power
              generation. As a result, being able to understand how to solve these equations
              will help society because it will help us make progress on those very useful
              applications. In several of these societally useful applications, interest
              often focuses on solving these problems on an adaptive mesh in order to
              efficiently resolve solutions. As a result, we will focus on formulating second
              order accurate techniques for resistive adaptive mesh refinement
              magnetohydrodynamics in this work.
