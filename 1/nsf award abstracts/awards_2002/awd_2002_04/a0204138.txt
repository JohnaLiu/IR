Title: 
              Mathematics Socialization & Identity

On almost every measure of mathematical
              achievement and persistence, African American students lag behind their peers.
              Because mathematics serves as a gatekeeper for information technology majors
              and careers, African Americans are also disproportionately shut out of these
              areas. In order to better understand the societal, community, school, and
              intra-personal forces that affect their under-representation, Contra Costa
              College and Dr. Danny Martin have been awarded a three-year ethnographic and
              observational study that will focus on mathematics socialization and
              mathematics identity among a diverse group of African Americans. 

The
              participants in this study will be African American parents, community members,
              students and teachers of students selected from communities in two northern
              California cities-Richmond and San Pablo. Both cities are located within 50
              miles of Silicon Valley and have significant African American populations.  The
              two cities also have school systems that are representative of many urban
              districts.  The project will also focus on selected programs, services, staff,
              and students at Contra Costa College, an institution that has had a high rate
              of success in transferring minority students to four-year colleges and
              universities in mathematics, computer science, and engineering.
