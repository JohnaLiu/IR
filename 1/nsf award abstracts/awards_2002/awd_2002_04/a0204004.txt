Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) provides funds for an
              examination of fluorescence as a means for identification of bacteria on solid
              surfaces.  A number of constituents common to all organisms, including several
              amino acids and vitamins, fluoresce in response to ultraviolet or visible
              light.  Because the amount, duration and wavelength of such florescence should
              vary with the exact composition of each organism, measurement of florescence
              could provide a means to identify bacteria in the presence of other materials
              and distinguish one type of bacteria from another. Using a synchrotron light
              source for irradiation of bacteria at well-defined wavelengths between 170 and
              700 nm., the peak wavelength and time-decay of fluorescence by several,
              non-pathogenic species of Bacillus and other bacteria will be determined and
              then compared to the fluorescence of other particulate materials including
              plant pollen and clay.  The goal is to investigate the potential utility of
              fluorescence as the basis for a device to detect bacteria on the surface of
              envelopes and other objects.
