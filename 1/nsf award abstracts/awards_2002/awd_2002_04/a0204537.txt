Abstract    :
              The ongoing work involves the analysis of the structural behavior of the
              Pentagon building on 11 September 2001. There are two poignant questions about
              the observed behavior of the building that deserve
              investigation:

1.	Immediately upon impact of the Boeing 757, the reinforced
              concrete building lost approximately 30 columns in the ground story. Instead of
              an immediate collapse the structure remained standing to allow its occupants to
              be rescued. What were the structural attributes that prevented progressive
              collapse?
2.	The Boeing 757 crashed into the building at a speed exceeding 750
              ft/sec. It had enormous kinetic energy. The debris was stopped in 300 ft. What
              characteristics of the structure were the main factors in absorbing the
              energy?

The insights gained are made available a Group. The final report
              will include the development of a web site containing the data and their
              studies. Presentations are made at professional society meetings.
