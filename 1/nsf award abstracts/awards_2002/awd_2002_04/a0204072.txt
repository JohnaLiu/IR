Periodic waves and spiral
              waves arise in a rich variety of applied problems.  Important examples include
              periodic wave patterns in models of media with multiple phases, for example van
              der Waals gas dynamics and elasticity, or three-phase flow in porous media. 
              Planar spiral wave patterns occur in chemical reactions, such as the
              Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, and in various biological and physical systems.
              There is a similarity between periodic waves and spiral waves, since the
              continuous spectrum associated with a periodic wave or a spiral wave touches
              the imaginary axis.  The goal of this project is to investigate linear and
              nonlinear stability of such waves in not only the one-dimensional case but also
              multi-dimensional cases. 

Mathematical models of interest in physics,
              chemistry, biology, and engineering often have classes of special solutions
              that are particularly important for understanding behavior of the systems under
              study.  This project analyzes two such important classes of solutions in models
              that involve partial differential equations: periodic waves and spiral waves. 
              The goal is to provide rigorous mathematical analysis of the stability of these
              solutions.  This qualitative information determines the suitability of the
              differential equations to model the physical phenomena under investigation.
