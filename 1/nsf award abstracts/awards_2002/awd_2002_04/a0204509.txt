The proposed work is in the area of geometric
              group theory. 
A motivating question is: Given a graph of groups G with some
              
kind of restriction on the vertex and edge groups, what can be 
said about
              G?  For example, is G a non-trivial free product?; 
does G split over the
              integers?; what is the JSJ-decomposition 
of G? A focus will be on finite
              graphs of finitely generated 
free groups. As an indication of progress along
              these lines, 
with his graduate student Guo-An Diao, the principal
              investigator 
has found an algorithm for determining whether a finite graph of
              finitely generated free groups is a non-trivial free product.

Topological
              spaces are often analyzed by cutting them open 
and then considering the
              resulting simpler pieces. An easy 
example of this is that if a circle is cut
              then an arc remains. Analogously, groups are often studied by cutting them open
              along subgroups. Since groups may be represented as symmetries of 
spaces,
              splittings of groups and splittings of spaces are 
two manifestations of the
              same construction. For example, 
the splitting of the circle above gives a
              description of 
the integers.  One of the most exciting developments in
group
              theory over the past 20 years is the description by 
Rips-Sela of all
              splittings of groups over subgroups such 
as the integers. Dunwoody-Sageev and
              Fujiwara-Papasoglu 
have extended the types of splittings that can be
              described. 
The principal investigator will explore the extent to which
              
these descriptions can be made algorithmically.
