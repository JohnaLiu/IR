This award supports
              participants in a workshop, held in Fall 2002, and an international conference,
              held in Spring 2003, at Northwestern University.  The meetings, part of an
              emphasis year on nonlinear partial differential equations and applications,
              will bring together a diverse group of applied mathematicians and analysts who
              are able to explore connections between their fields.  Discussion will be
              devoted to the development of new connections between nonlinear partial
              differential equations and such diverse areas as fluid dynamics, kinetic
              theory, free boundary problems, phase transition phenomena, biophysics, and
              modeling and computation, as well as nonlinear analysis, approximation theory,
              geometric measure theory, and harmonic analysis.  The interdisciplinary
              meetings will provide excellent opportunities for communication and
              collaboration between senior and junior researchers.
