Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to support detailed petrological and geochemical
              studies of abyssal peridotites recovered by the Ocean Drilling Program from the
              Hess Deep (Leg 147) and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, south of the Kame Fracture Zone
              (Leg 153).   Extensive abyssal peridotite suites recovered on each drilling
              leg.  Studies by shipboard scientists form the framewrok for this study in
              which we propose to investigate the following key questions:  (1) Are the
              calculated whole-rock NaxO contents inabyssal peridotites conclsively higher
              than melting and melt percolation models predict?  (2)  What are the localized
              distribution patterns of clinopyroxenes and spinals in abyssal peridotites? 
              (3) What are the minor element and trance element abundances of clinopyroxene,
              spinal, orthopyroxene, and olivine in these abyssal periootites?  What
              correlations exist in these minor and trace elements at mid-ocean ridges?  (5)
              Is it possible to more accurately quantify melt-rock interactions, such as the
              particularly well developed examples from the Hess Deep?
