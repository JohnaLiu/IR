The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment
              (OGLE) has undergone a major upgrade from a 2000 x 2000 CCD camera (OGLE-II) to
              a mosaic 8000 x 8000 CCD camera (OGLE-III). The new system
became operational
              in the summer 2001, and it is expected to be fully streamlined, with a real
              time detection of microlensing events, by 2002. The 1.3 meter OGLE telescope is
              located at the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. 

With the OGLE-II, Dr.
              Paczynski and his colleagues were detecting about 170 microlensing events per
              year. With the OGLE-III and new software, they expect to detect up to 1,000
              events per year. This high rate virtually guarantees a detection of Jupiter
              mass planets and stellar mass black
holes. The same data will be searched for
              planetary transits. 

Almost all OGLE-II data (1997-2000) are now available
              on WWW and on DAT, in a highly
compressed format: 1 Terra Byte of original CCD
              images has been reduced to less than 10 GB.
The archive includes high
              signal-to-noise images of about 16 square degrees in the Galactic Bulge, the
              Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and the
              photometry of about 30 million non-variable stars. The AC archive has 300 - 400
              data points for about 250 thousand variable stars. The group expects to make
              the photometry of about one million variable stars detected by OGLE-III
              available on-line, first within 24 hours, and some time later within 10 minutes
              of taking CCD images. OGLE data will be used to study the structure of our
              Galaxy, the structure of the LMC and SMC, as well as to determine ever more
              accurate distance scale.
