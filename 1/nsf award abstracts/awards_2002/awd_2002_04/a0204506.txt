The proposal consists of two projects which
              are
motivated by the geometry of three dimensional manifolds.
The first
              project uses quasisymmetric homeomorphisms
as a framework to understand the
              asymptotic geometry
of hyperbolic groups.  Several uniformization and
              
rigidity problems are discussed.  The central problem
is Cannon's conjecture
              that a hyperbolic group with
boundary homeomorphic to the two-sphere is a
              lattice
in the isometry group of hyperbolic space.  A resolution
of this
              conjecture would be a major step toward Thurston's
Hyperbolization conjecture.
               The second part of the 
proposal addresses the Weak hyperbolization
              conjecture,
the other missing step in the proof of Thurston's conjecture.
The
              proposed attack uses geometry and dynamics of
surface laminations in three
              manifolds.

One of the major open problems in Mathematics is to determine
              
the possible shapes (topologies) that a three dimensional space 
might
              assume.   In the 1970's, Thurston formulated his famous
Geometrization
              conjecture, which is a precise statement about
how the classification of such
              spaces should look.  The 
proposal addresses a piece of Thurston's conjecture
              known 
as the Hyperbolization conjecture.  The general line of attack 
is to
              associate a two dimensional self-similar fractal sphere 
with each three
              dimensional space, and reduce the original
conjecture to showing that one can
              find "good" coordinate systems
for this associated fractal sphere.
