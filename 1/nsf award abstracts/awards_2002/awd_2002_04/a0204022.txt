              Performance Modeling of Applications Executing in the Internet2 Domain

	The
              objective of this research project is to advance the state-of-the-art in
              modeling and simulation to the point that the Internet2 network infrastructure
              and protocols, the high-performance applications that are and will be developed
              within this environment, and the interactions between these individual
              components can be studied, Analyzed, and predicted.  This project will provide
              significant support to both systems engineers, and application developers and
              users.  From a systems point of view, it will provide and environment in which
              new and existing networking hardware and software can be tested and studied as
              a function of expected (and observed) application types and loads on the
              system.  From the point of view of an application, this research will support
              its performance and scalability analysis as a function of its execution
              environment.
