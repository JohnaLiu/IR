This project is centered around
              a list of problems on the border of
topology, geometry and analysis. The least
              speculative problem is part
of a collaboration with V. Kapovitch to prove that
              there are compact
topological 4-manifolds that do not admit Alexandrov
              metrics. The result
should follow by a suitable modification of previous work
              of S. Donaldson
and D. Sullivan. The most speculative problem in the list is
              to study the
interaction between Gromov-Witten invariants and finite type
              invariants.

Many different ideas are used in geometric analysis, and
              developments
in this field will effect a broad range of other disciplines. For
              example
symplectic geometry and gauge theory were developed to describe
              mechanics
and electrodynamics. These ideas were developed into subtle
              invariants
of smooth manifolds defined via the solution to systems of partial
              differential equations. 
Various gluing formulae developed to compute these
              invariants
resulted in relationships with other invariants that arise from a
              combinatorial
point of view. Properties of the combinatorial invariants lead
              to conjectures
about the smooth invariants, and vice versa. It is exactly this
              interplay
that makes geometric analysis such an important field.
