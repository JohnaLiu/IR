Abstract    :
              The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) is held yearly
              at
different locations in the world. The 2002 ISIT will be held at the Palais
              de
Beaulieu in Lausanne, Switzerland, from Sunday, June 30, to Friday, July
              5,
2002.

This grant provides  support for the travel expenses of ISIT
              participants from
the U.S.  These participants would be individuals whose
              papers have been
selected for presentation at the Symposium, but who lack
              funds and would not be
able to attend without travel support.
