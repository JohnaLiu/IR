Abstract    :
              CHE-0204065
PI: Richert, Ranko

In this project, funded by the Experimental
              Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Richert will perform
              research using triplet state solvation dynamics to study relaxation and
              dynamical heterogeneity in glass-forming liquids.  Experiments will be
              performed on probe rotation, polarization-angle-dependent detection of the
              solvation time correlation function, and heterogeneity on the microsecond to
              nanosecond time scales.  A new technique developed by Richert allows the first
              simultaneous measurement of probe rotational dynamics and solvation dynamics. 
              

This project deals with the important topic of how supercooled liquids make
              a transition to the solid state of aggregation.  Many previous experiments have
              pointed to the existence of heterogeneous regions in the otherwise homogeneous
              liquid, with the heterogeneous regions exhibiting different dynamical behaviors
              from the homogeneous ones.  The principal investigator has invented a unique
              technique by means of which the properties of the heterogeneous regions can be
              obtained separately from the homogeneous ones in a single experiment.  Great
              advances in the understanding of the liquid to glass transition are expected to
              result from this research, with potential applications to polymer science and
              plastic crystals.  Students will participate in this research.
