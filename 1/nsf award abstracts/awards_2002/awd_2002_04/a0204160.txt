Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2002.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Identifying rapidly changing genes and their impact on the speciation process
              in sunflowers through genome level sequence comparisons."  If speciation is
              caused by adaptation to different environments, genes under strong selection
              for different adaptations may also be speciation genes.  This study uses
              comparative analyses of genome sequences among sunflower species to identify
              genes on which natural selection is strongest and then tests to see if these
              genes are involved in speciation.
