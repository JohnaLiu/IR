Supernovae have become exceedingly interesting
              astrophysical objects in recent years owing to their use as cosmological probes
              (standard candles visible at great distances) to determine expansion of the
              universe and to measure the dark energy of the universe, and also due to their
              possible association with mysterious gamma-ray bursts. 

The main work in
              this  project  will focus on the comparison of observed data with theoretical
              models in order to clarify the connection between specific classes of
              supernovae and stellar evolution models of the progenitor star. The principle
              investigator will study effects such as the metallicity dependence of the
              progenitor on its observed spectrum and light curve, and extend to every type
              of supernovae consideration of their use as distance indicators.  Three central
              questions that are to be addressed concern the progenitor systems of each type
              of supernova, the consistency between stellar evolution hydrodynamical models
              for supernovae and observations of them, the values of the cosmological
              parameters when they are calculated using the detailed spectral models of  the
              Spectral-fitting Expanding Atmosphere Method applied to high redshift Type II
              supernovae, and finally, the statistical and systematic uncertainties
              associated with these values.
