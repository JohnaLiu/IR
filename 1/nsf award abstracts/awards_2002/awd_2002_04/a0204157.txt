This section
              summarizes the progress the co-PI has made under the support of NSF grants
              DMS-9804759
(07/01/98 06/30/00)for the project Adaptive Control Algorithm for
              Adaptive Optics Applications and
DMS-0073056 (08/01/00 7/31/03)for the project
              Algorithms for the Inverse Problem of Matrix Con-
struction of the former,the
              objectives are to design,analyze,and evaluate adaptive control algorithms
              for
adaptive optics applications.The co-PI has established a mathematical
              framework for the linear econstructor
problem in adaptive optics,and has made
              progress in the understanding of a latency-delay control algorithm.
Fo the
              latter,the proposed objectives were to investigate both the theory and the
              practice of constructing a
physical model,described mathematically in the form
              of a matrix,from prescribed spectral data.The co-PI
has collected,classi
              .ed,and de .ned the egimen of inverse eigenvalue problems as a whole,and has
              developed
new numerical methods for tackling some inverse eigenvalue
              problems.Thus far,a signi .cant portion of these
objectives has been
              accomplished under the NSF support as is evidenced below.
