The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will support a twenty-four month research
              fellowship by Dr. Rachel Teasdale to work with Dr. Steve Sparks at the
              University of Bristol in the United Kingdom.

The purpose of this project is
              to quantify the crystallinities of basaltic lava flows to increase
              understanding the conditions that occur prior to eruption and during transport.
               The PI will measure crystallinities from magmas with high volatile content
              from non-gassed submarine lava flows and experimentally produced lavas at
              variable volatile content; combine crystallinity data collected from degassing
              experiments with crystallinities that develop in the open flow channel at
              atmosphere pressure cooling experiments and she will develop an analog flow
              model for morphology-crystallinity behavior.  This project, with its modeling
              and observations to determine the characteristics of lava flow behavior, will
              have an impact on public safety issues.

Dr. Sparks is a leader in the study
              of volcanic flows and has expertise in the area of crystallization of lava
              flows.
