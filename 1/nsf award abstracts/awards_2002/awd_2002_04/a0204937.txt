In this US-Argentina award, Dr. Jorge Pullin of Louisiana
              State University will collaborate with Dr. Oscar Reula of the Universidad
              Nacional de Cordoba in Argentina to study the application of hyperbolic
              formulations of the Einstein equations of general relativity in order to
              provide stable evolution schemes for the binary black hole coalescence problem.
               Among the studies they will undertake is the use of linearized and other
              approximation techniques and lower dimensional modeling to determine stable
              configurations of equations, boundary condition issues, and how various gauge
              choices influence the stability of the schemes.

The problem of how to solve
              Einstein's equations numerically for astrophysically interesting simulations is
              one of the most urgent problems in general relativity today.  To numerically
              model the collision of two black holes is of critical importance, since that is
              expected to be one of the main sources of gravitational radiation to be
              detected by the NSF-funded Laser Interferometer Gravity Wave Observatory
              (LIGO).  It is expected that the last moments of the collision will produce a
              significant burst of gravitational radation that, due to the strong field
              nature and lack of symmetries of the problem, can only be predicted by
              numerical simulation.  The combined knowledge and experience of this
              international collaboration will work toward solving this important problem.
