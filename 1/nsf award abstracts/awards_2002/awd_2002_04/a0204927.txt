The main goal of the proposal is to apply methods
              of 
noncommutative geometry and supergeometry to the mathematical 
problems
              arising in theoretical physics. 
The development of (super)string theory led
              to the idea that 
this theory should by embedded into  more general
              theory
called M-theory. This hypothetical theory should live
              in
11-dimensional space and the corresponding low energy action
should be
              given by 11-dimensional supergravity. At this
moment a rigorous definition of
              M-theory is not known. 
Nevertheless, using various heuristic tools (first of
              all,
dualities) physicists have created a beautiful and
consistent picture,
              where all versions of (super)string
theory can be obtained as limiting cases.A
              promising approach 
to a rigorous definition of M-theory is based on
              so
called M(atrix) theory. The action functional of BFSS M(atrix) 
model can
              be obtained from ten-dimensional supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory ( 10 D SYM
              theory) by means of dimensional
reduction to (0+1)-dimensional space.(This
              means that we should 
consider only gauge fields that do not depend on
              spatial
variables, but can be time-dependent.)  It was shown  by  
A.Connes, 
              M. Douglas and A. Schwarz (1998) that
compactification of M(atrix) theory  can
              lead
to gauge theories on noncommutative spaces, in particular, on
              
noncommutative tori.This paper  opened the way for application 
of Connes'
              noncommutative geometry to string/M-theory  . It
became very popular,
              especially after the appearance of the
influential Seiberg-Witten paper (1999)
              , that contains
together with important new  results, the understanding
              of
Nekrasov-Schwarz noncommutative instantons (1998),  gauge
(complete)
              Morita equivalence defined by A.Schwarz (1998),and  
Pioline-Schwarz
              background independence (1999)    from the
string theory viewpoint. The number
              of papers considering  the 
relation of string/M-theory to noncommutative
              spaces grows 
exponentially (today it is close to a thousand); many of
              these
articles  were influenced by the papers of A. Schwarz and
              his
collaborators. A. Schwarz  intends  to continue his work on
applications
              of noncommutative geometry to string/ M-theory.  
He is  planning to  analyze
              thoroughly the general theory of 
gauge fields on noncommutative spaces and 
              its relation to the 
duality in physics. He would like to apply (in
              collaboration 
with M. Movshev) this general theory to  the construction
and
              analysis of gauge theories on noncommutative curved spaces. 
One more
              direction  the PI  would like to pursue ( also
together with M. Movshev) is a
              search of formulation
M(atrix) theory ( and, more generally, maximally
              supersymmetric
gauge theory) in a manifestly supersymmetric form. The solution
              
of this problem is interesting by itself, but M. Movshev and 
A. Schwarz 
              are planning to use it also as  a starting point in 
the construction of a 
              maximally supersymmetric Dirac-Born-Infeld
action  for nonabelian gauge fields
              and on  noncommutative 
spaces. A. Schwarz is planning to develop a complex
              version of 
Connes' noncommutative geometry and the theory of
noncommutative
              theta functions having in mind possible
applications to noncommutative
              instantons and other BPS
fields.He  aims also to study the role of K-theory in
              
string/ M-theory. M. Movshev  is planning to analyze
algebraic structures
              arising in open string field theory. 


It is clear now that noncommutative
              geometry is quite useful
in physics. The PI intends to develop methods
              of
noncommutative geometry and to apply these methods to
various problems
              arising in string/ M-theory. It seems
that noncommutative geometry should play
              an important role
in rigorous formulation of M-theory. The PI hopes that
his
              work will contribute to the search of appropriate
mathematical formalism.
