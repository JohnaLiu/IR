A Framework to Combine
              Semantic and Structural Information for Static Analysis

The research involves combining semantic and structural information
              of program source code for 
the static analysis of software.  Static analysis
              normally takes into consideration only structural 
information of the source
              code.  The research investigates the use of information concerning the 
domain
              semantics to enhance existing static analysis methods.  The semantic
              information is 
derived from the comments, documentation, and identifier names
              associated with the source 
code.  A framework will be developed that allows
              the combination of semantic and structural 
information of the source code. 
              The framework will provide means to compute new measures 
and metrics that
              describe the software (e.g., cohesion and coupling).  Additionally, the
              research 
will study different information retrieval methods and how they can
              be used to extract relevant 
semantic information from the source code.  An
              empirical assessment of the framework and the 
use of semantic information for
              static analysis will be undertaken.  Combining semantic 
information with
              existing static analysis methods will result in new and improved analysis
              tools.  
These tools will help software engineers better analyze, maintain,
              and assess the quality of large 
software systems.
