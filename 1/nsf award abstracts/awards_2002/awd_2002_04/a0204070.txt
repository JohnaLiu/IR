Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2002.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Using Spatial and Species Explicit Forest Dynamics Models to Optimize
              Biodiversity Conservation in a Managed Landscape."  Managing biodiversity in
              tropical forests requires solving an optimization problem that simultaneously
              maximizes biodiversity and timber value over time. This optimization problem is
              being solved through the development of sample based biodiversity indices, the
              development of spatial and species explicit forest dynamics models, and the
              quantification of the opportunity costs of biodiversity protection.
