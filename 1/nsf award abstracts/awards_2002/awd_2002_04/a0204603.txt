  The proposal is devoted to    Symplectic
              Field Theory  (SFT) whose
  framework was recently described by A. Givental,
              H. Hofer and the 
  author of this proposal. SFT is a large project which lies
               on the 
  borderline between Symplectic Geometry, Hamiltonian Dynamics, 
 
              Enumerative Algebraic Geometry, Low-dimensional Topology, Theory of 
 
              Integrable Systems in Mathematics, as well as String Theory and 
  Mirror
              Symmetry in Theoretical Physics. Among the goals of the theory:
  - definition
              of new, SFT-based invariants of symplectic and contact 
    manifolds and
              their Lagrangian and Legendrian submanifolds;
  - applications  to the 
              Low-dimensional topology;
  - development of  new tools for proving
              enumerative  results about 
    periodic orbits of   Hamiltonian systems;
  -
              understanding of the appearance  of integrable hierarchies in 
   
              Gromov-Witten theory.
 
  Symplectic Field Theory has already proved to have 
              important                  
  applications. In particular, the ideas of the
              SFT were
  instrumental in the solution of several old outstanding questions

               in Symplectic Geometry and Hamiltonian Dynamics. There is a hope 
  that some
              current research in the SFT may bring some breakthrough 
  in the
              low-dimensional topology. Further development of the theory 
  should also
              bring new applications not only inside Mathematics, but  
  possibly in some
              areas of Theoretical Physics, including String 
  Theory and Mirror Symmetry.
              Besides developing new applications the 
  work under this project will also
              concentrate on building the 
  rigorous foundations of the SFT.
