This project continues to develop a set of ideas
              which 
began with an attempt to understand automorphism groups 
of free
              groups by representing them as homotopy equivalences 
of graphs. The space of
              all such homotopy equivalences, 
called Outer space, is a contractible space
              on which the 
group of outer automorphisms of a free group acts
              properly
discontinuously.  Analyzing the quotient of Outer space by 
this
              action has yielded a significant amount of algebraic 
information about this
              group over the years.  More recently,
work of Maxim Kontsevich has  related
              the rational homology 
of this quotient to the homology of a certain
              
infinite-dimensional Lie algebra, consisting of derivations 
of the free Lie
              algebra.   Kontsevich also defined variations 
of this infinite-dimensional
              Lie algebra whose homologies 
are related to the homology of mapping class
              groups and to
Kontsevich's graph homology, which is a homology 
theory
              containing various 3-manifold and knot invariants.  
The Principal
              Investigator will use this point of view to 
obtain new information about
              invariants of these groups 
of classical interest to topologists; conversely,
              topological 
methods will be applied to obtain new information about 
these
              Lie algebras and their homology.  In particular, new 
Lie bi-algebra
              structures on the chain complexes used to
compute graph homology, recently
              discovered by Jim Conant 
the the Principal Investivator,  will be
              investivated. 
Finally,  the local geometry of Outer space will be studied. 
              
Certain neighborhoods in Outer space are non-positively 
curved metric
              spaces, and can be identified with spaces 
of finite labelled metric trees. 
              Such trees are of interest 
in many branches of science, including biology,
              where they 
appear as evolutionary trees produced from DNA data. Another 
aim
              of this project is to determine efficient algorithms for 
finding geodesics in
              this space, and to continue from there 
to develop a program of applying
              statistical methods to this 
space of trees.  

Graphs and trees appear in
              many contexts in the sciences and 
in mathematics.  In Geometric Group Theory 
              a space of graphs 
known as Outer space, originally defined by Marc Culler and
              
the Principal Investigator,  has been used extensively to 
study the group
              of outer automorphisms of a finitely 
generated free group.  In this project
              the Principal 
Investigator will continue to study how the geometry of 
this
              space is related to algebraic properties of the group 
of automorphisms. A new
              perspective on this problem is 
provided by work of M. Kontsevich; motivated
              by 
considerations from physics and symplectic geometry, 
Kontsevich defined
              various abstract infinite-dimensional 
algebraic structures whose invariants 
              are closely related 
to invariants of Outer space.  Finally, small regions of
              
Outer space can be identified with spaces of finite trees.  
Such trees are
              used as a tool by evolutionary biologists, 
and another focus of this project
              is understanding the 
local geometry of these regions in a very concrete,
              
algorithmic way which can be applied to problems in
molecular
              phylogenetics.
