Homotopy theory is the study of topological
              phenomena that 
remain invariant under fairly flexible sorts of continuous
              deformations.  Most basically, we seek to compute and to 
understand homotopy
              classes of maps between finite simplicial 
or CW complexes, perhaps after some
              sort of stabilization. 
Computation and understanding are not the same: we
              have forty 
or more years of computations, but only lately have we begun 
to
              have the language to in which to make a coherent theory out 
of the data we
              have. This project is, therefore, as much about exploring and refining the
              language as it is about calculations 
-- although there will be a mixture of
              both.  The entry point 
is the observation that any cohomology theory with a
              good 
theory of Chern classes gives rise to a formal group law
and, hence, a
              formal group. Conversely, given a formal group
we can ask whether there is an
              associated cohomology theory.
These cohomology theories then delineate the
              finer structure
of stable homotopy theory.

This is the chromatic picture of
              stable homotopy: we seek
to use the algebraic geometry of formal groups to
              organize and 
direct investigations into the deeper structure of computations
              
and theory.  This project seeks to develop this point of view 
in two
              directions, one local and one global.  The first, or 
local, direction is an
              investigation into K(n)-local homotopy 
theory in general and into the
              K(n)-local sphere in particular. 
The second, or more global, direction, would
              be to make systematic
our knowledge of structured ring spectra using stacks
              and 
the moduli stack of formal groups as the basic parametrizing
device.
