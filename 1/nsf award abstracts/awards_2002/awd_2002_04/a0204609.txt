Abstract    :
              
Over the next year, the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP) will
              publish four Arctic environmental assessment reports and a second State of the
              Arctic Environment Report (SOAER), and also conduct a Second AMAP International
              Symposium on Environmental Pollution of the Arctic.  The publication and the
              international symposium will be based on updated information and a substantial
              amount of additional data that were not available for similar activities in
              1997-1998.

Acting on behalf of the U.S. federal agencies participating in
              AMAP, NOAA will coordinate Federal support for the publications and the
              symposium.  Other federal agencies are expected to contribute (or have already
              contributed) $85, 500 for these purposes.  NOAA's Arctic Research Office will
              arrange transfer of all the contributed funds to the AMAP Secretariat and will
              oversee expenditure of the funds by the AMAP Secretariat.
