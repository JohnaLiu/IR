One can associate to a smooth manifold a symplectic
              structure
on its cotangent bundle, and to a real-analytic Riemannian
              manifold
a canonical complex structure on a domain inside its cotangent
              bundle.
This project will continue work of the investigator studying
              these
symplectic and complex structures. A broad aim is to discover
              how
closely the symplectic geometry relates to the smooth structure on
the
              original manifold, and how the complex geometry reflects the
Riemannian
              properties. Also, since much symplectic infomation is
contained in properties
              of compatible complex structures, it is also
interesting to relate the
              symplectic and complex geometry. Cotangent
bundles are the simplest examples
              of symplectic manifolds, yet many
fundamental problems in symplectic geometry
              are still elusive in
these cases. The investigator will conduct research into
              the
uniqueness of symplectic structures and of isotopy classes of
Lagrangian
              submanifolds. The complex manifolds we study arise
naturally in many branches
              of mathematics, notably algebraic geometry
and representation theory.
              Important aspects of their geometry
remain to be understood, together with
              analytical problems which
should have applications to number
              theory.

	Symplectic geometry originated as the modern mathematical
language
              of classical and quantum mechanics. It is now an exciting
area of pure
              mathematical research, but continues to benefit from
current physical ideas.
              Since the eighties it has been clear that
much insight into symplectic
              geometry can also be gained from
studying compatible complex structures.
              Fortunately the study of
complex geometry has long been a main focus of
              mathematics. This
project will conduct research into both symplectic and
              complex
geometry, focussing on interactions between the two. The
              specific
objects of study arise as the first examples of
              symplectic
manifolds, and as examples of complex manifolds occuring
              frequently
in many branches of mathematics and theoretical physics.
