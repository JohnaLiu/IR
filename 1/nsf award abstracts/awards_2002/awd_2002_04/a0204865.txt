Abstract    :
              Creating a universal, free to read, digital library containing over one million
              scanned books
with optical character recognition to support full text
              searching is the goal of this million book
project. Such a resource furthers
              the democratization of knowledge by making this large digital
library
              available to scholars, students, and citizens around the world. The
              availability of online
search allows users to locate relevant information
              quickly and reliably thus enhancing student
success in their research
              endeavors. This 24x7x365 resource would also provide an excellent
test bed for
              further research in database creation, OCR technique, machine metadata
              creation,
and textual language processing research such as machine
              translation, summarization, intelligent
indexing, and information
              mining.

National Science
Foundation resources would be amplified at a rate
              of almost twenty to one because the countries
of India and China will be
              providing the labor to digitize these materials. In addition, members of
the
              U.S. Digital Library Federation would ship materials to be scanned and
              returned. Private
grant funding is being sought to cover shipping expenses.
