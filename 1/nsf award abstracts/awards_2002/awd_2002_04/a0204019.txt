Abstract    :
              Developing a Resource-Aware Adaptive Compilation System for High-Performance
              Distributed Computing

The goal of our work is to combine successful Grid
              infrastructure with novel program compilation and optimization techniques to
              support portable and high-performance distributed computing.  We plan to
              develop adaptive compilation and runtime techniques that are guided by the
              dynamic performance characteristics of underlying Grid resources.  To
              investigate these techniques, we will use language environments that come from
              Internet computing (Java and .Net) as development vehicles.

The framework we
              propose, a Resource-Aware Adaptive Compilation System, makes resource
              performance and availability predictions, e.g. for networks, CPUs, memory,
              disk, etc., available to a dynamic compilation system so that programs compiled
              "just-in-time" achieve minimum overall execution time adaptively.  That is, we
              will adapt the level of program optimization (and subsequent execution time
              tradeoff) dynamically, based on the instantaneous performance profile of the
              Grid resources at hand.

To address this problem of achieving portable
              high-performance using the Grid, we propose to investigate adaptive program
              compilation and on-the-fly optimization of high-performance distributed
              applications using Computational Grid resources.  We will guide runtime and
              compiler optimization using predicted resource performance (generated by the
              Network Weather Service) and re-optimize code to adapt to changes.
