Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2002.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Inferring evolutionary importance of genes from the shapes of multi-species
              gene genealogies."  It is predicted that loci causally involved in divergences
              of incipient species have gene trees that are monophyletic within species and
              concordant with species phylogenies. This research develops coalescent-based
              probabilistic models to describe shapes of multi-species gene genealogies. 
              These models are being applied to genomic sequence data to identify loci
              potentially involved in species divergences.
