The goal of this proposal is to investigate
              geometric 
constructions inspired by the analogy between the moduli 
space of
              curves together with higher spin structures and 
the moduli space of curves
              together with maps into orbifolds.
The former is related to higher KdV
              integrable hierarchies 
while the latter is related to the quantum cohomology
              of 
orbifolds. We will analyze the resulting algebraic structures 
suggested
              by integrable systems and the topology of these spaces.

The KdV equation is
              a nonlinear equation modeling the behavior 
of water waves in a straight
              channel and is the first of a 
hierarchy of equations whose solutions are
              mutually compatible. 
Such hierarchies and their generalizations are
              intimately 
related to surfaces endowed with additional fields
              possessing
internal symmetries. We will investigate this relationship 
and
              its ramifications.
