Title: Flexible statistical
              modeling

Abstract

The investigator and his students will study the
              popular support vector machines from the viewpoint of the traditional logistic
              regression model (with regularization). While the latter exhibits very similar
              generalization performance to the SVM, it has several advantages: it estimates
              class probabilities, and generalizes to multiclass problems seamlessly. This
              and several other even simpler approaches will be developed for the
              classification of gene expression arrays.

This proposal will thus develop
              useful models for making class predictions in a variety of high-dimensional
              situations, in particular for gene expression arrays. While the science
              journals abound with exotic statistical and computational algorithms for use in
              this fashionable domain, this investigator and his colleagues firmly believe
              that some very simple modifications of classical approaches perform as well or
              better, and are easier to understand.
