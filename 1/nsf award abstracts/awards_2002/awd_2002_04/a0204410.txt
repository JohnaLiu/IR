Abstract    :
              Software systems evolve over time in order to adapt to changes in
environment. 
              Graceful software evolution requires that only expected
changes in
              functionality occur; while desirable, this is difficult to
achieve. Software
              tools are needed to automate the evolution of
complex software systems
              containing heterogeneous components, by
reporting change impact information to
              programmers, allowing
examination of the effects of code edits.  Tool support
              for change
impact analysis has a clear potential to boost programmer
              productivity
and enable safe code enhancement.

This research in change
              impact analysis assumes that an
object-oriented system is developed with a
              suite of tests, run as the
system is updated to check the safety of changes. 
              Analyses can
determine which tests are affected and which changes affect each
              of
these tests.  Since these tests often exercise
              independent
functionalities, the tests affected correspond to
              those
functionalities that may have been altered. This research will
              develop
an interactive tool for change impact analysis of Java, as part of
              a
industrial-strength programming environment to ensure practicality.
The
              tool will allow experimentation with the granularity of changes
and program
              representations, incrementalization of the analyses,
collection of a Java
              benchmark suite, and application to collaborative
software development.
