Abstract    :
              Title:   Optimizing Performance and Reliability in Distributed Computing Systems
              Through Wide Spectrum Storage Services

Logistical Networking promotes an
              innovative model of network storage that views data transmission and storage as
              part of a unified framework, just as military or industrial logistics view
              transportation lines and storage depots as coordinate elements of a single
              infrastructure. Under the Logistical Computing and Internetworking (LoCI)
              project, we have created and implemented a primitive abstraction of network
              storage, called the Internet Backplane Protocol (IBP) [43], as the lowest
              network layer in a "storage stack" for Logistical Networking. 

The goal of
              the proposed research is to test this hypothesis by creating a Logistical
              Runtime System (LoRS) designed to support advanced applications on a
              well-provisioned network of IBP-based storage, and then exploring its value and
              performance along several dimensions using real-world Grid applications.
