Abstract    :
              This effort will provide more accurate measurement of our Sun's spectral output
              in the range 360 to 1100 nm. This will be done by deploying a state-of-the-art
              CCD-array solar spectrograph to a high altitude favorable site (either Mauna
              Loa or Mauna Kea), as part of a self-contained autonomous system. Calibration
              will be carried out using a monochromator and absolute photodiode "trap
              detectors." Data will be reduced using Langley extrapolation (and in the
              stronger absorption bands methods similar to Reagan-Brugge fitting), to yield
              the solar output free of atmospheric absorption.
