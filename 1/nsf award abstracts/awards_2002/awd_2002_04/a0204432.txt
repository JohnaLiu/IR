Abstract    :
              The objective of the project is to produce useful and practical
methods for the
              development of large complex software systems. The
research will address the
              problem of composing software components
into large systems that have
              guaranteed correctness properties.
State-explosion (the exponential growth of
              the number of possible
system behaviors with the number of the system's
              components) is
avoided by analyzing interactions among every pair of
              components
separately, rather than inspecting the interaction of all
              components
at once.  This local approach nevertheless enables us to prove
              that
the overall system behaves as desired.  Since the number of
              behaviors
that have to be analyzed is much smaller, the amount of effort
              needed
to rigorously analyze and verify large systems is greatly
              reduced.

The main activities are:

1. Develop techniques for the precise
              description of the
required behavior of a software component.

2. Develop
              practical methods for reasoning about the behavior that
results when a set of
              components are connected to form a large
system.

The benefit of this
              research is to reduce the cost of creating
realistic size software systems
              that have demonstrable correctness
properties.
