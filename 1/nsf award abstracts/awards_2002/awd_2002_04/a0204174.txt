The final properties
              of polymer products are largely determined by process conditions such a low
              rate, shape of processing die and cooling temperature, which are represented as
              condition parameters in mathematical models. In this sense, modeling
              viscoelastic fluid behavior provides a fundamental explanation of the structure
              of polymer products such as fibers and films. Advances in the  finite element
              computational methodologies for simulating the fiber and film process is a
              recent development in polymer industries.
The goal of this work is to
              introduce mathematical optimization techniques into the nu-merical simulation
              of viscoelastic fluid, in order to determine optimal process conditions for
              polymer products. Two research projects are involved in the proposal: film
              casting and a vorticity minimization problem. The overall strategy will be to
              integrate recently developed viscoelastic models and optimization techniques in
              order to meet objectives through various control mechanisms such as shape
              control and boundary control. As an equation solver for the film casting
              problem, the commercial software package Poly ow, which simulates film and
              fiber processing in various settings, will be used. For the other problem, a
              finite element code
currently under development will be used. In solving the
              optimization problems, recent results
from current research will be extended
              to the more general and high dimensional viscoelastic
regime.
