Wallerstein, George
"Travel Funds for Stellar Abundances
              Conference"
 AST- 0204805

This conference, to be held March 27-29 in
              Seattle, WA, is on chemical abundances in stars and on nuclear astrophysics.
              The invited speakers are leading experts in the field. They will discuss the
              observations relevant to the determining the content of elements such as
              Helium, Lithium, Iron, and others in stars of various ages throughout the
              universe. There also will be presentations on the current state of our
              theoretical knowledge and of modeling  the production of various elements in
              the deep interiors of stars and how they are mixed into the outer layers of a
              star, as well as the creation of the elements at the time of the Big Bang. The
              conference is international in scope with attendees from several European
              countries as well as the U.S. The proceeding are to be published by World
              Scientific under the auspices of the Institute for Nuclear Theory. The funds
              support the travel for two of the invited speakers, 10 young American
              presenters, and 5 young European presenters to this meeting who would not
              otherwise be able to attend.
