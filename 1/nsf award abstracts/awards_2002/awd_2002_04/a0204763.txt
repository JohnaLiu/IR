The investigator plans to study spaces of
              hyperbolic metrics on a fixed
3-manifold. Unlike on a closed manifold, on an
              open 3-manifold there will
typically be a large space of hyperbolic metrics.
              The investigators
goal is to understand this space. Some questions are simple
              to state:
Is the deformation space the closure of its interior? A more
              detailed
description of the space is the ending lamination conjecture,
which
              gives invariants that classify every hyperbolic metric on
the manifold. This
              classification is not a parameterization; the map to
the space of invariants
              is not continuous. The investigator is
interested in understanding these
              discontinuities and describing the
topology of the deformation space of
              metrics. Hyperbolic cone-metrics
are a key tool used throughout this work. The
              philosophy is that very
complicated geometry in a smooth hyperbolic structure
              can be exchanged
for a less complicated, but singular, hyperbolic cone
              metric.

Three manifolds are mathematical spaces that locally look like
              the
universe we live in. Mathematicians, beginning with Poincare, have
              been
interested in classification question about three manifolds.
              Hyperbolic
geometry is also a very old field dating back to the middle of
              the
eighteenth century. In the last twenty-five years, largely due to the
              work
Thurston, it has been realized that there are deep and
              beautiful
connections between the two topics.
