Abstract    :
              The Infinity Scholars program at Iowa Lakes Community College provides
              scholarship assistance to 32 academically talented, financially needy students
              enrolled full-time in computer science, computer technology, engineering and
              mathematics programs. The overarching goal of the program is to increase
the
              number of talented, low-income students enrolled and retained in these degree
              programs
enabling them to enter the high technology workforce. The program
              establishes and maintains an infrastructure of support services for Infinity
              Scholars that includes a one credit hour Infinity Scholars Course that
              concludes with the completion of a capstone project. The Infinity Scholars
              program focuses on 
delivering a menu of educational services and learning
              experiences that retain students and support a seamless transition to job
              placement upon degree attainment from the community college, or transfer of
              students to 4-year institutions.
