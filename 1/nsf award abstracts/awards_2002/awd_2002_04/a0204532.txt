Title: Efficient and Robust
              Designs Based on Ordered Units

The goal of this project is to find efficient
              designs for experiments conducted over time to compare different treatments,
              varieties of objects or methods. A substantial part of the project deals with
              crossover experiments, where it often happens that subjects drop out prior to
              the conclusion of the experiment, thereby reducing the information content of
              the data, or even jeopardizing the validity of the conclusions. Here the aim is
              to identify efficient designs that are largely robust to subject dropout.
              Another part of the project deals with experiments where a trend over time must
              be accounted for in the model and analysis. Here the aim is to identify
              efficient designs that are flexible enough to accommodate a wide variety of
              experimental conditions and models that arise in real applications.

Proper
              statistical design is a critical aspect of scientific experiments; it ensures
              that the conclusions, based on observed data, remain valid in the larger
              context. This project deals with experiments in a variety of fields, including
              biomedical, agricultural and industrial experiments, that are conducted over
              time. As the experiment progresses, uncontrollable factors could influence the
              outcome. The aim of this project is to develop designs that perform well in
              diverse experimental conditions as well as designs that are robust against the
              inadvertent loss of experimental subjects before the conclusion of the
              experiment.
