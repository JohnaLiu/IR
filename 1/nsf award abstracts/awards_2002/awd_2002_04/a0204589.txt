	Conference on Minimal Varieties in

The Dept. of Mathematics at SUNY Stony Brook will host
              a conference on
              MINIMAL VARIETIES IN GEOMETRY AND
              PHYSICS
			June 1 - June 7, 2002
on the occasion of Blaine Lawson's 60th
              birthday. The progress in the
study of minimal varieties in a broad sense has
              had a profound impact
on numerous areas in geometry and physics. This
              conference will bring
together mathematicians and physicists working on
              minimal varieties
and their recent applications.

The award provides partial
              support for active researchers in this 
area, who otherwise have limited means
              of funding, to participate in the 
conference. Most of the funds will support
              younger mathematicians and
mathematicians from underrepresented
              groups.

Confirmed Speakers: S. Bloch, J.P. Bourguignon, R. Bryant, J.
              Cheeger, T. Colding, 
J. Figueroa-O'Farrill, E. Friedlander, H. Gillet, H.
              Gluck, P. Griffiths, 
M. Gromov, R. Harvey, D. Hoffman, P. Lima-Filho, R.
              MacPherson, W. Meeks, 
W. Minicozzi, R. Osserman, M. Rocek, J. Rosenberg, R.
              Schoen, I. Singer, 
G. Tian.

Organizing Committee: M. Anderson, D. Gromoll,
              C. LeBrun, M. Rocek, A. Phillips, 
S. Simanca.

The conference has 4 main
              themes: minimal submanifolds of
Riemannian manifolds, calibrated geometries,
              complex subvarieties and
algebraic cycles, and the Dirac operator.

There
              will be 3 mini-courses:
I.  Minimal surfaces in 3-manifolds (Colding and
              Minicozzi)
II. M-theory and calibrations  (Figueroa-O'Farrill)
III.Algebraic
              Cycles (TBA)
