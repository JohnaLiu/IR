According to the most current theories of cosmology,
              hydrogen, the most abundant element left over from the big bang, was formed out
              of free electrons and protons when the Universe cooled below a temperature of a
              few thousand degrees. However, recent observations imply that most of this
              relic cosmic hydrogen was dissociated once again (i.e., `re-ionized') less than
              a billion years after the big bang. It is commonly believed that the cosmic
              hydrogen was re-ionized by the ultraviolet radiation emitted by the first
              generation of stars and black holes in the universe.  How and when did the
              first galaxies form in the Universe? What was their effect on the surrounding
              cosmic gas?  These are two of the most exciting questions in observational and
              theoretical cosmology today.  This project will combine analytic calculations
              and limited numerical simulations of radiative transfer problems to address
              these questions and make detailed predictions for the expected clues that
              future, cutting-edge observations might reveal. In particular, it will identify
              observational probes that could signal the cosmic time at which most of the
              hydrogen was re-ionized.  The interplay between theory and observations of the
              hydrogen re-ionization epoch will constrain the properties of the first sources
              of light in the early Universe as well as fundamental cosmological parameters
              (including the nature of the dark matter).
