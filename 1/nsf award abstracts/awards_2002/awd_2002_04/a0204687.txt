In this research project the PI proposes to study
              
different problems related to geometry, analysis and 
probability on
              discrete groups.  The groups the PI is 
interested in are lattices in Lie
              groups, groups generated 
by finite automata, random and hyperbolic groups
              in
the sense of Gromov, groups acting on buildings. 
The PI found recently
              new examples of groups with 
property (T) and the PI intends to continue the
              study 
of groups with this property.  In particular, the PI would 
like to
              find other groups with property (T) and continue 
the study of automata
              groups. During this study the PI 
plans to investigate properties of these
              groups related 
to amenability, torsion, growth and the following famous
              
conjectures:  the Atiyah conjecture about L2  Betti numbers, 
the
              Baum-Connes conjecture, and the Kaplansky-Kadison conjecture 
about the
              idempotents. The PI proposes also to continue 
the study of spectral
              properties of random walks operators
and more generally the Hecke operators
              for groups generated 
by finite automata and buildings.

Property (T) is a
              quite abstract property of some groups,
but which found applications in
              constructions of computer and communication networks. The PI proposes to find
              new groups
with this property which would have applications to several
              
problems related to efficiency of certain algorithms.  The 
other project
              concerning automata groups combines the 
problems from the abstract group
              theory and applications 
in computer science. The PI plans to give several
              mini-courses 
for graduate students based on this research.
