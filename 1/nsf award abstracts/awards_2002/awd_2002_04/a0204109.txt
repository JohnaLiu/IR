Due to
              today's exponential growth of the internet and computing power, an information
              retrieval
system is expected to handle a tremendous amount of data, and users
              demand more efficient techniques
to obtain useful information from the flood
              of data.  The goal of this proposed research is to find lower dimensional
              representations of text data in vector space based information retrieval.
              Dimension reduction is imperative for achieving high efficiency and
              effectiveness in manipulating the massive quantity of data in today's
              information retrieval system. A problem of fundamental importance here is to
              achieve better representation of the data with relatively severe dimension
              reduction, rather than simple dimension reduction through a lower rank
              approximation of a matrix. One difficulty is that it is not easy to measure by
              a theoretical formula how well a certain dimension reduction method provides a
              good representation of the original data, and it will be essential to conduct
              theoretical research in parallel with experimental study.
