Abstract    :
              The ATLAS detector is currently under construction for operation at the Large
              Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland. Extensive studies show that
              the LHC should be able to elucidate the mechanism of electroweak (EW) symmetry
              breaking and to study a variety of other topics related to physics at the TeV
              scale. In particular, a Higgs boson with couplings given by the Standard Model
              will be observable in several channels over the full range of allowed masses.
              If supersymmetry is relevant to EW interactions, it will be discovered and the
              properties of many supersymmetric particles elucidated.

This proposal
              requests support for the research of approximately 250 physicists and engineers
              from 33 U.S. institutions that comprise the U.S. ATLAS Collaboration.  The U.S.
              ATLAS groups are making major contributions to the construction of the ATLAS
              detector and have continuing responsibilities for the components they have
              built as the detector is installed in the experimental cavern and during the
              commissioning and installation phases.  The U.S. ATLAS groups are planning to
              establish Tier 2 regional computing centers as part of an overall hierarchical
              grid of ATLAS computing centers spread around the world. The Tier 2 centers, a
              key component of this proposal, will play a powerful role in allowing U.S.
              universities to fully exploit the potential of the LHC, and will set an
              important precedent for future collaboration on large-scale, international
              projects.

The groups continue to expand their education/outreach programs,
              with a particular focus on high school teachers and students (closely
              coordinated with QuarkNet) and on outreach to traditionally under-represented
              populations.
