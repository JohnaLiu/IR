              ABSTRACT DMS - 0204480.  PI: C. Robin Graham

This project will study
              conformal and CR geometry.  Algebraic, analytic,
and geometric aspects will be
              considered via the introduction of metrics in
higher dimensions which are
              associated to the original conformal or CR
geometry.  Understanding the higher
              dimensional spaces gives rise to problems
of independent interest.  Motivation
              is provided by the AdS/CFT
correspondence in physics.

Conformal geometry is
              the study of properties of space which are unchanged
by transformations which
              preserve angles but not necessarily lengths.
Conformal mapping and geometry
              has found numerous applications to practical
problems for many years, such as
              the design of airplane wings.  Conformal
geometry in higher dimensions has
              recently been the object of much interest
in so-called holographic
              correspondences in physics.  This project will
study properties of the
              underlying geometric spaces, partially motivated by
the interaction with the
              physical theories.
