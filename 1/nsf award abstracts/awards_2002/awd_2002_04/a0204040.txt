Abstract    :
              EIA-0204040 Mary Hall University of Southern California Resource-Aware Off-line
              and On-line Empirical Optimization 

The research we propose herein explores
              a new paradigm that fundamentally restructures the compilation process to
              enable resource-aware optimization.  We will demonstrate how this system can
              alleviate some of the problems that lead to inefficiencies in big science and
              engineering codes today:  register pressure, cache conflict misses, the
              trade-off between synchronization, parallelism and locality in SMPs, and
              process migration in computational grids.  There are three essential components
              of this research program:

	Compiler-directed off-line empirical
              optimization;
	Dynamic feedback, for user-and compiler-directed on-line
              optimization; and
	Experience base to guide optimization from history:  The
              results of experiments from both off-line and on-line empirical optimization
              will be maintained in an experience base, which can be used to generalize prior
              optimization results and plan a future optimization strategy.
