CTS-0204375
H. Chen, The University of Arizona, Tucson
It is
              proposed to investigate the feasibility of applying intelligent search
              techniques for the filed of nanoscale science and engineering (NSE) on
              databases and websites.  The motivation for the research is that searching the
              World Wide Web for information in NSE with conventional search engines (like
              Google or Yahoo!) yields several thousand "hits," most of which are of low
              value or relevance to the search objective while other related data are missed.
               Therefore, customized intelligent search techniques are needed to enable NSE
              researchers and the public to learn about recent developments in the
              subspecialties of NSE in which they may have interests. The focus is on the
              academic and industrial data, in US and abroad.   A phased approach is
              proposed: a prototype portal (web site) and vertical search engine in three
              months, based on adaptations of existing tools plus NSE discipline knowledge,
              followed by enhancing in the subsequent six months with intelligent searching
              and clustering, post-retrieval analysis, automated directory generation, and
              user testing and evaluation.  
Successful implementation of a domain-specific
              portal and intelligent search capability for NSE will benefit not only academic
              community but also the government and industry users.
