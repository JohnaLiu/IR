Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2002.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Development and testing of genetic algorithms for inferring maximum-likelihood
              based phylogenies from very large, heterogeneous molecular data sets." 
              Likelihood-based phylogenetic algorithms become very computationally expensive
              as data sets become larger. However, genetic algorithms offer an efficient
              alternative to existing methods.  This project uses a large molecular data set
              to test the efficiency and accuracy of a recently developed genetic algorithm
              under various models of evolution and search conditions.  The data are being
              used to construct a phylogeny of frogs.
