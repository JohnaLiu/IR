Abstract    :
              This research is to study various aspects of inverse scattering 
problems
              arising in wave propagation and in quantum mechanics 
and their applications. 
              These include wave propagation in a 
nonhomogeneous and absorptive medium and
              the determination of
the nonhomogeneities and absorptivity of the medium,
              X-ray 
reflectometry and the determination of material properties
              of
stratified thin films by probing them with X-rays, focusing of 
waves at
              target locations and the determination medium properties
by using wave
              focusing, developing exact quadratures to analytically 
continue a reflection
              coefficient from an interval to larger 
domains and their numerical
              implementation, and solving inverse
scattering problems in order to recover
              functions with slower 
decay conditions at infinity.

The inverse scattering
              problems investigated have important applications in many
areas such as
              materials science, nondestructive testing, acoustic 
imaging, and remote
              sensing.  The principal aim is to determine
properties of a target in a remote
              fashion: send a wave onto the
target, analyze the scattered wave, and infer
              the properties of the
target from the scattering data.  In addition to its
              practical 
importance in physical sciences, engineering, and other applied
              
areas, the research will contribute mathematical techniques to 
various
              areas of mathematics and it will also help to train 
some graduate and
              undergraduate students in applied mathematics.
