Krylov sequence methods are widely used in the solution of large
              eigenproblems (e.g., the Lanczos and Arnoldi methods) and the solution of large
              linear systems (e.g., the conjugate gradient method and GMRES). In their
              ordinary applications these methods are well understood and have a firm
              theoretical basis. In more exotic applications, however, the theory and
              practice are not as advanced. This proposal in concerned with
three of these
              applications.  Residual Krylov methods. The property of being a Krylov sequence
              is very sensitive to error. A single error toward the beginning of the sequence
              causes permanent loss of
accuracy in the approximations to eigenvectors in the
              Krylov subspace. This has the consequence that when shift-and-invert techniques
              are used to enhance the spectrum of a matrix, the resulting linear systems must
              be solved to full accuracy at each step of the process. It turns out, however,
              that if the sequence is extended using the residual for a targeted eigenvector,
              the sequence converges to that vector even when the shift-and-
invert
              equations are solved inaccurately. The practical consequences of this
              observation, which needs new theory to support it, promises to be great.
