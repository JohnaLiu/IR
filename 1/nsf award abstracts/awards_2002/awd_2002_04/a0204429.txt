Abstract    :
              Cluster computing systems are becoming increasingly popular for
providing
              cost-effective and affordable computing environments for a
range of
              applications (such as databases, data mining, visualization,
collaborative
              computing, and high performance computing).  These
applications require four
              fundamental communication services from the
underlying communication
              subsystem: point-to-point communication,
collective communication,
              synchronization, and Quality of Service
(QoS).  Modern Network Interface Cards
              (NICs) for clusters incorporate
one or more programmable processors, DMA
              channels, and large amount of
memory. The NICs are becoming faster, smarter,
              and intelligent and are
being designated as Active Network Interfaces. 
              Research is proposed
along the following directions to take advantage of such
              active
network interfaces for implementing and delivering
              scalable
communication services for next generation clusters: 1)
              Using
multi-CPU NICs and their architectural features to provide
              fast
point-to-point communication, 2) Designing NIC-level support
              for
high-performance and scalable collective communication
              and
synchronization, 3) Taking advantage of programmable NIC-level
features
              to provide QoS support, and 4) Experimentally evaluating the
benefits of the
              new/enhanced communication services for a wide range
of applications using
              message passing programming model.  Through
extensive theoretical,
              experimental, and simulation studies, NIC-based
solutions are planned to be
              designed, developed, implemented, and
evaluated for clusters with Myrinet and
              Gigabit Ethernet
interconnects.
