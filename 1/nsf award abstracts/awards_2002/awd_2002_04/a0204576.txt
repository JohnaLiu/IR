This project is concerned with several aspects of
              large 
scale geometry and topology.  One of the main points of 
study is the
              problem of producing actions from quasi-actions, 
along the lines of the
              classical theorems of Sullivan and
Tukia.  Such results have significant
              implications in the quasi-isometric classification of groups, especially for
              
groups with natural splittings as a complex of groups.  A 
second area of
              study is large scale versions of rigidity
phenomena in the geometry of
              symmetric spaces, and 
specifically the classification of quasi-isometric
              embeddings 
between symmetric spaces, giving a geometric analogue of
              
superrigidity.  A third and independant project involves 
coarse versions of
              topological rigidity, including the coarse 
Borel, Novikov, and Baum-Connes
              conjectures.

    Roughly speaking, large scale (or coarse) geometry is 
the
              study of geometric properties of objects "seen from far 
away".  From this
              perspective, any bounded object is 
indistinguishable from a point, and a line
              of dots is 
indistinguishable from a solid line.  This sort of geometry 
has
              been influencial recently in many areas of mathematics, 
notably group theory,
              topology, and geometric analysis.  This
research will explore the large scale
              geometry of several 
classes of mathematical objects, both classical geometric
              
spaces and objects only now being viewed in a geometric manner.
