Title:  
              APSIT:  Alternate Pathways to success in Information Technology

This ITWF
              award provides support for the Alternate Pathways to Success in Information
              Technology (APSIT) program which seeks to explore the nature of the IT and
              engineering educational and career pathways used by successful female and
              minority Georgia Tech alumni.  The objectives of the project are:

1.  To
              determine, through the use of paper and telephone surveys, face-to-face
              interviews, and institute records of Georgia Tech alumni, whether the
              educational and career strategies used by white women and by men and women from
              underrepresented ethnic groups differ from the strategies used by white men in
              their successful pursuit of IT and engineering degrees and careers. 

2.  To
              explore correlations between high school and college educational success (as
              measured by grade point average, and standardized test scores) with indices of
              later success in the IT and engineering work force, and to analyze these
              correlations by gender and ethnicity. 

3.  To explore IT and engineering
              field-specific differences in educational and career success for women and
              minorities.
