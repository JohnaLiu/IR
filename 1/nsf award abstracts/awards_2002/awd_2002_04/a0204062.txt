Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2002.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "How much influence do the collateral effects of selection have on natural
              levels of genetic variation?"  Genetic variance among populations, FST, is
              being measured at multiple mapped loci from specific linkage groups in Silene
              latifolia. The relationship between FST-values and genetic map distance is used
              to estimate the differential effects of selection across the genome,
              elucidating the overall effect of selection on population genetic structure.
