A conference at Princeton University will be
              held in September 2002 to
study geometric applications of D-bar estimates
              which have appeared in the
past decade. The conference will bring together
              researchers in D-bar
estimates and mathematicians in related fields to survey
              the techniques
and problems of D-bar estimates and their geometric
              applications.

One special feature of the conference is an emphasis on the
              participation
of young and women mathematicians. Moreover, for the benefit of
              young
researchers (and mathematicians in other fields) interested in
              learning
to get into the topics of the conference, a formal session of open
              problems
is planned for the conference and, after the conference, a website
              will be
put together and maintained under the umbrella website of the
              American
Institute of Mathematics (http://www.aimath.org).
