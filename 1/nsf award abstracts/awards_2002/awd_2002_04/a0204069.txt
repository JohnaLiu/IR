Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2002.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Computer simulation of lipid bilayer permeation."  Phospholipid bilayer
              membranes regulate the transport of molecules into and out of the cell.  Though
              most transport is assisted by channels or membrane proteins, passive transport
              directly through the bilayer does occur.  A molecular-level understanding of
              membrane permeation can shed light on the blood-brain barrier, the mechanisms
              of anesthesia, and basic processes such as osmosis and the diffusion of oxygen
              and carbon dioxide.  It may also assist in predicting the bioavailability of
              orally-administered drugs.  The proposed research is the computer simulation of
              the permeation of small molecules through lipid bilayer
membranes using recent
              algorithms developed for long-time molecular dynamics simulations.
