The project has two goals: (1) To investigate at
              high resolution the spectra of the so-called Herbig Ae/Be stars, believed to be
              intermediate-mass analogs of the young stellar objects known as T Tauri stars,
              by concentrating on those of known age and luminosity because the are members
              of five well-investigated young star clusters; and (2) to extend the
              spectroscopy of several FU Orionis-like eruptive variable stars in order to
              clarify a number of possibly critical conflicts with the standard
              interpretation of the so-called Fuor phenomenon in this class of star. The FU
              Orionis stars are pre-main sequence stars that have brightened significantly
              sometimes on short time scales and are not well understood.
