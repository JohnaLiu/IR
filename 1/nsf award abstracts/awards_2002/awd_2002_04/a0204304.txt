Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the problem of providing better access 
to web
              information and services to a rapidly growing user population. 
The goal is to
              take the next step toward scalability by performing a 
systematic study of
              architecture, problems, and performance issues 
in content distribution
              networks. New ways to reduce response time 
and the load imposed on the
              network will be explored. An integrated 
approach is adopted to study the
              synergetic effect of different 
components in content distribution systems.
              Specifically the research
will include developing dynamic content delivery
              techniques, designing
application-level multicast delivery protocols,
              developing dynamic 
server selection algorithms, and studying dynamic replica
              placement 
methods.
