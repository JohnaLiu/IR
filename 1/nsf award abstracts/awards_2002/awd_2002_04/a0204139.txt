Abstract    :
              Safety analysis is essential for high-assurance software systems. 
Safety
              analysis identifies the hazards, derives the software safety
requirements to
              eliminate or control these hazards, and ensures that the design
and
              implementation incorporate those safeguards.  A product line is a
set of
              products that share a common set of features and a related market
              or
mission.Currently, high-assurance product lines are being built without
              the
tools or conceptual framework necessary to perform effective safety
              analyses. 
This research addresses the question of how safety analysis
              can
become a reusable asset of a product line by developing a framework and
              asuite of techniques for the safety analysis of critical product lines.
              Anticipated benefits of the research include extending safety analyses
              toproduct lines, providing a framework for reuse of safety analyses within a
              product line, deriving formally specified limits on reuse of product-line
              safety analysis, and enabling safer product-line systems at lower cost and
              reduced schedules.  The results will be empirically evaluated by application
              in
industrial case studies.  This project will expand the opportunities
              available to
student researchers to participate in development of
              safety-analysis
techniques for product lines.
