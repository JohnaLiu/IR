Title:  Women in the IT Workforce:  How
              Level is the Playing Field?

This ITWF award provides support to study
              institutional contexts and their related factors that are theorized to affect
              the work-related outcomes of women after they enter the information technology
              (IT) workforce.  By work-related outcomes is meant job tenure, job
              satisfaction, job mobility, and job status, earnings and workforce retention. 
              The project will focus on the IT specialties of software and information
              systems (as opposed to hardware or telecommunications) because they represent
              one of the fastest growing segments of the computer and IT industry. 
 
The
              expanding employment opportunities in IT work have encouraged a popular view
              that possession of IT skills should level the playing field for all workers. 
              In effect, this perspective implies that job opportunities, or alternately the
              lack of opportunities, are correlates of levels and types of skill workers
              possess.  Collectively, the bundle of skills and experiences individuals bring
              to employers is known as human capital.  The human capital view says little
              about the institutional contexts that circumscribe IT work, or about IT workers
              and their gender.  This project theorizes that the job-related outcomes for
              women entering the IT workforce will be influenced by various institutional
              factors and that the outcomes of women will be different from those of men.
