This proposal is for research on several promising new
              approaches to 
designing an observer for a nonlinear control system, including
              
linearization of the state error dynamics, backstepping and multiple
              
extended Kalman filters.  In order to decide which type of observer is
              
appropriate for a given nonlinear system, one needs a classification of the
              
range of possibilities. Therefore a study of the normal forms of a nonlinear
              
system under a group action that is appropriate to observer design is also
              
proposed.

A control system is a mathematical model of a real world
              process.  It has 
inputs and outputs which model the way the way the system
              interacts with 
the external world and has state variables, which describe the
              internal 
memory of the system.  The state evolves according to some dynamical
              
model driven by the inputs and the output is some function of the state and
              
possibly the input.  The fundamental problem of control systems is to 
close
              the loop in such a way as to achieve stability.  We wish to use 
negative
              feedback based on the current state to stabilize the system to 
some desirable
              operating regime.  But usually the current state is not 
directly measurable
              so we must design an observer to estimate it from the 
past inputs and
              outputs.  The development of nonlinear observer design 
methodologies is a
              paramount problem of systems theory and its 
applications.  There is no
              current approach that is effective for all 
nonlinear systems.
