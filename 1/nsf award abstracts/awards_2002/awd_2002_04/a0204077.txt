Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop system-on-a-chip (SOC) test resource
              partitioning techniques based on test data compression. Topics being
              investigated under this grant include: (i) data compression codes; (ii)
              efficient on-chip decompression architectures; (iii) low-power scan testing.
              This project is expected to lead to a unified framework to reduce SOC test data
              volume, testing time, and test power.
