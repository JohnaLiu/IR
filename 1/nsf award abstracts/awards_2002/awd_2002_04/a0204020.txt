Abstract    :
              Theoretical and computer simulation studies of effective interactions and
              thermodynamics phase behavoir in macromolecular materials will be undertaken.
              Three classes of systems will be investigated: charge-stabilized colloidal
              suspensions, polyelectrolyte solutions, and colloid-polymer mixtures. The main
              objectives are to characterize effective interactions between macromolecules in
              solution and in input these interactions into staistical mechanical theoris and
              computer simulations to predict thermodynamic behavoir. The project will
              benefit the new Computational Physics program at North Dakota State
              University.
