The project will study several issues in Topology
              and Geometry.
The central theme is that of real structures which can be
              defined
on symplectic and contact manifolds. With the presence of
              such
structures, the proposal aims to introduce new versions of
              Gromov-Witten
theory, Seiberg-Witten-Floer theory, and to apply the
              resulting
invariants to String Theory  as well as  Real Algebraic
              Geometry.
Another aspect of the project will study related analytical
              problems
on manifolds that possess open conical singularities.

Real
              Algebraic Geometry concerns the real solutions of real polynomials
which arise
              naturally in many real-life applications. Despite the
fact that this is one of
              oldest Mathematical branches, we have so far
made very little progress in
              understanding it. Our project will attempt
to fill the gap partially by using
              new machinery following from the
pioneer work of Donaldson, Floer, Taubes etc.
              It was Einstein's dream
to unify all four fundamental forces in the nature.
              Through Quantum
Mechanics, it is possible to unify the strong force, the weak
              force and
the electro-magnetic force. However the unification with the
              fourth
force, the gravity, has eluded some of the greatest thinkers of our
              time.
Nowadays it is commonly believed that String Theory offers the best
              hope
to achieve this last unification. Complex manifolds with real
              structure
are called orientifolds in String Theory. These are popular
              but
still poorly-understood objects for Physicists. A purpose in the
              project
is to lay down a rigorous mathematical foundation for Gromov-Witten
