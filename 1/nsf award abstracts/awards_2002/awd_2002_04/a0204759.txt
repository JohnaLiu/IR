Abstract    :
              
This is a study of the kinetics and mechanism of the gas-phase reaction of
              hydroxyl (OH) radicals with two-and three-ring polycyclic automatic aromatic
              hydrocarons (PAHs); this matter is of fundamental concern in both combustion
              and atmospheric chemistry.  Experimental data are collected over extended
              temperature (300-1200oK) and pressure (50-750 torr) ranges.  A pulsed laser
              photolysis/laser-induced fluorescence (PLP/LIF) technique refined for the study
              of semivolatile compounds is used for the kinetic and mechanistic measurements.
               Experiments include measurements of the effects of pressure on observed
              reaction rates and kinetic isotope effects.  Experiments are complemented with
              a theoretical study of addition and obstruction reactions using ab initio
              quantum chemical methods.  Transition-state theory (TST) is used to obtain rate
              constraints and branching rations, and Rice-Ramperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM)
              theory to estimate lifetimes of intermediates.
