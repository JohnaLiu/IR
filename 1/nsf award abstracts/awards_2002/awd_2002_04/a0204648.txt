This proposal addresses several
              topics in inverse spectral
geometry. In the first project, the Principal
              Investigator will
show that the classical trace formula, which relates the
              Laplace
and length spectra for generic manifolds, provides less
information
              about isospectral manifolds than was previously
speculated. In joint work with
              P. Perry, the wave trace on
Heisenberg manifolds will be explicitly calculated
              in order to
understand the behavior of the length vs. Laplace
              spectra.
Additionally, a new notion of length spectrum will be studied
              in
order to prove a necessary condition that lengths of closed
geodesics on
              isospectral manifolds must satisfy. A further project
(joint with J. McGowan)
              studies the p-form spectrum on lens
spaces. The Principal Investigator has
              constructed examples of
lens spaces whose p-form spectra are equal for certain
              p but with
unequal spectra on functions. This behavior will be
              further
studied toward constructing p-isospectral lens spaces with
              unequal
absolute length spectrum; i.e., different lengths of
              closed
geodesics. In the final project (joint with R. Brooks) tools
              from
representation theory of the symmetric groups will be used to
construct
              an explicit upper bound on the number of isospectral
Riemann surfaces of a
              fixed genus that can be constructed from the
Sunada method. When this final
              project is completed, an explicit
upper bound on the number of nonisomorphic
              number fields with a
given zeta function will result.

In 1966, Mark Kac
              popularized the question, "Can one hear the
shape of a drum?"  The
              mathematical formulation of this question
is: ``What geometric information is
              contained in the spectrum of a
Riemannian manifold?'' Isospectrality, i.e.,
              the study of
isospectral families and/or the geometric properties they may
              or
may not share, impacts areas outside of spectral geometry; the
research
              funded by this proposal thus supports the
pure-mathematical foundations of
              these areas. The first examples
of closed isospectral manifolds, Milnor's flat
              tori, have appeared
in string theory in physics (related to mirror symmetry).
              The
empirical science of spectroscopy has studied frequencies of atoms
and
              molecules to provide information about vibrating objects.
Inverse spectral
              problems also arise in medical imaging,
geophysical prospection, and
              non-destructive testing.
