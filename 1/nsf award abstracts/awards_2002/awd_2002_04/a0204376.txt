Gravner
	Professor Gravner will pursue further research in cellular
              automata. The research will continue in several new directions. The growth
              models featured in this project range from simple threshold rules and
              competition dynamics, to interacting systems of random walks and percolation
              models in low- and high-dimensional spaces. Among the principle topics are:
              effects of random perturbations in the environment and in the rule,
              fluctuations of random interfaces, generation of fractal patterns, behavior of
              large--neighborhood systems, large scale limits of systems of random walks, and
              relationship between structure of genotype space and genetic diversity. 
	The
              aim of this project is to understand microscopic and macroscopic principles by
              which various physical systems propagate disturbances far from the equilibrium.
              Among instances of such growth dynamics are crystal growth, spread of
              epidemics, propagation of waves, competition between species, and genetic
              diversification. Such research can contribute to understanding of such natural
              phenomena as: threshold density for survival and growth vs. the range of
              interaction for species in an unfriendly environment, transition between sharp
              geometric crystal shapes and rough random ones, effects of noisy environments
              on spread of infections, validity of approximation based on large range of
              interaction or fast diffusion, and role of neutral mutations in genetic drift.
