Title: 
              What Does it Take to Succeed in Information Technology?  A Multi-Level Analysis
              of Stakeholders' Perceptions of Critical Attributes and the Effects of
              Stereotype Fit.

Washington State University has been awarded an ITWF grant
              to examine beliefs about the attributes of successful IT professional, applying
              social psychological research on gender stereotypes and cognitive processes in
              performance evaluation to the case of IT professionals.  The study will examine
              associated effects on employee satisfaction, commitment, and performance.   Key
              research questions include:  What are the desired characteristics of IT workers
              that are necessary to be successful in IT occupations?  Do the desired
              characteristics fit men more so than women?  How do evaluation and reward
              systems impact the retention of workers in the IT workforce?
