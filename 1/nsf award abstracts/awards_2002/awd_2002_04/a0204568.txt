Title: Non-equilibrium collisional transport in nano and mesoscale
              modeling


This research project is concerned with several equations of
              statistical mechanics and transport theory at the nano- and mesoscale.  Of
              particular interest are integrodifferential equations for kinetic collisional
              transport (like the Boltzmann equation) and systems of integrodifferential and
              partial-differential equations for transport of charged particles (quantum
              hydrodynamic-Poisson equations).  The goal is to rigorously analyze these
              equations by proving existence and stability theorems and by numerically
              simulating the underlying physical problems.  The project requires the
              development and application of new tools from nonlinear analysis, as well as
              the design of new computational strategies linking the different models from
              the quantum level to the kinetic level to the fluid level.

This research
              program has applications in several areas.  We mention the rapid flow of
              granular materials, which is described by statistical models for collisional
              transport of inelastic particles, and electronic nanodevice modeling, where
              channel lengths are of the order of nanometers and quantum tunneling effects
              are important.  The results of this research are expected to lead to the design
              of deterministic computational tools that can be applied to the simulation of
              multiscale phenomena in highly heterogeneous media, for example in turbulent
              granular flow problems and electronic or biological nanodevice modeling.
