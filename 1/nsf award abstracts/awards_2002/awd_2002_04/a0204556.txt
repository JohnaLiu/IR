Longitudinal data, which involve
              variables observed repeatedly over time, are common in biomedicine,
              epidemiology, economics, sociology, and many other fields. Nonparametric and
              semiparametric statistical methods provide effective tools for extracting
              useful information from this type of data. These methods allow scientists,
              policy makers and researchers to draw conclusions from their data without
              depending on pre-specified assumptions that may be too restrictive to their
              settings. The objective of this proposal is to develop systematic,
              theoretically well-founded, and more efficient such methods. 

The focus is
              on the following five topics: (i) further theoretical and methodological
              development of the spline-based approach to time-varying coefficient models;
              (ii) estimation of covariance structures; (iii) extension of time-varying
              coefficient models to generalized linear models; (iv) extension of time-varying
              coefficient models to take into account accumulative covariate effects; (v)
              semiparametric efficient estimation in partly linear models. These projects
              involve developing novel estimation and inference procedures, providing
              theoretical justification, and discussing their theoretical and practical
              importance to the advancement of biomedical and statistical science. The
              research approach will be a combination of theoretical asymptotic analysis,
              Monte Carlo simulations and real data analysis. Global smoothing techniques
              with spline functions will be used.
