Title: Mechanical and electrical properties of heterogeneous
              solids

This project focuses on two problems related to heterogeneous
              materials: (1) the effect of texture and grain anisotropy on the strength of
              polycrystals, and (2) the electrical properties of high-contrast
              matrix-particulate composites. The investigation involves analysis of the
              mathematical models as well as numerical computations.

In most applications,
              crystalline materials are used in polycrystalline form.  Polycrystals of the
              same material but with different textures may exhibit different behavior.  One
              goal of the present research project is to gain a better understanding of the
              dependence of the behavior of polycrystals on their texture.  Better
              understanding will lead to better guidelines for materials selection and
              processing procedures.  A second goal of this project is to contribute to a
              better understanding of composite materials---materials composed of two or more
              integrated pure phases.  In general, a composite has better properties than the
              pure phases alone.  Examples of composite materials are plastics that are
              reinforced with glass fibers or glass particles: the result is a much stronger
              and stiffer material.  The results of this project will be useful for the
              design of composite materials with specific properties.
