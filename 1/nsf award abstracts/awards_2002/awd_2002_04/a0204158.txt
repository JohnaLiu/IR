Thang Le

Thang Le  plans to continue his study of quantum and
              finite type
invariants of links and 3-manifolds. In particular, he would
              like
to study problems arising around the volume conjecture which
connects
              quantum invariants to classical objects like fundamental
groups, torsions, and
              volumes. Other problems involve integrality
properties (in broad sense) of
              quantum invariants and the
topology behind them, and their applications. The
              field has
interactions with geometry, combinatorics, number theory,
              and
physics.

The theory of knots and 3-manifolds is an old branch
              of
mathematics which has gained renewed interest among
mathematicians and
              physicists after the discovery of the Jones
polynomial and its relation to
              theoretical physics (quantum field
theory, high energy physics). In fact, it
              is now one of the most
active domains in mathematics. Many results of knot
              theory may
also find applications in molecular biology. To classify knots
and
              3-manifolds, mathematicians use "invariants". This research
project studies
              new classes of invariants of knots and
3-manifolds and their relationships
              with the classical ones. The
new invariants are very powerful in
              distinguishing knots and
3-manifolds.
