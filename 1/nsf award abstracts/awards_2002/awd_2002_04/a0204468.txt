Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop a comprehensive co-design methodology,
              including algorithms and tools to facilitate the simultaneous power, noise
              margin, signal integrity, and power economy design with few, if any, design
              iterations.  

The key objectives are:

1. Develop novel hierarchical,
              efficient, distributed and accurate system-level power delivery RLS models and
              analysis tools to evaluate power reduction and noise-immune design techniques
              for power delivery.

2. Develop efficient power and area estimation
              algorithms  at the architecture level and at the physical design level.
