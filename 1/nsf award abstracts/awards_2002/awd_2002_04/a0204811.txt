Current understanding of both nuclear structure and
              nucleo-synthesis is largely based on what is known of the properties of stable
              and long-lived near-stable nuclei. An unexplored landscape containing more than
              90% of all expected bound nuclear systems, a region where many new nuclear
              phenomena are anticipated still needs to be explored. Early experiments on
              unstable nuclei have already revealed surprises. Such phenomena as halo nuclei
              suggest that some of the cherished concepts of nuclear structure may apply only
              to a set of relatively stable nuclei.

This project will theoretically study,
              the nuclei in the  and 160 mass regions. These nuclei have shown a number of
              features that challenge our understanding of nuclear structure, of particular
              interest being the signature splitting/inversion and "chiral twin bands"
              phenomena. Calculations in various model frameworks (particle rotor model
              including both a residual pn interaction and a   deformation, total routhian
              surface calculations, cranking shell and tilted axis cranking model) will be
              performed to elucidate the underlying physical properties responsible for the
              signature splitting/inversion and "chiral twin bands" phenomena.

The
              involvement of undergraduate students in this research project will enhance
              students' interest in physics and provide a training environment for their
              preparation for mainstream study.
