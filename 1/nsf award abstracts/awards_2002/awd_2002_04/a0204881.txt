This project studies the interaction of waves with localized
              structures, through mathematical analysis, asymptotics, and numerical
              simulation.  Motivating this study are simulations in which light, travelling
              through a specialized Bragg grating optical fiber, is stopped upon reaching a
              specially engineered defect at a given location in the fiber.  A heuristic
              hypothesis has been put forward to explain how and why this trapping of light
              occurs.  The project aims to understand the mechanism behind this light
              capture, and to use this understanding to improve the efficiency and usefulness
              of this process.  A main tool is the derivation and analysis of ordinary
              differential equations that model the interaction of the light pulse with the
              localized defect.  In order to gain intuition about this physical problem, the
              project will look at related problems in other nonlinear wave equations.

In
              modern optical communications, information is sent as pulses of light through
              glass fibers.  To process the information requires light pulses to be
              manipulated or redirected as they travel.  This project investigates the
              possibility of "trapping" light at a given point in an optical fiber, which
              could be useful as a component of optical communication devices, for example as
              a component in an optical memory unit.  The project will also look at similar
              problems of wave trapping in physical systems that are described by similar
              underlying equations.
