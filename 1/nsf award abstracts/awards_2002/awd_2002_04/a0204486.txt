Motion, like
              shape, is one of the fundamental modalities to be modeled in order to represent
              and manipulate the phys-ical world in a computer. As such, motion
              representations and the algorithms that operate on them are central to all
              computational disciplines dealing with physical objects: computer graphics,
              computer vision, robotics, etc. Mod-eling motion is also crucial for other
              disciplines dealing with temporally varying data, including mobile networks,
              temporal databases, etc. Motion algorithms require com-putational
resources,
              and frequently sensing and commu-nication resources as well, in order to
              accomplish their
task. Despite the prominent position that motion plays in so
              many computer disciplines, little has been done to date to provide a clean
              conceptual framework for representing motion, describing algorithms on moving
              objects, and an-alyzing their behavior and performance. It is the goal of this
              proposal to push the frontiers of the computer sci-ence representations and
              algorithms that deal with motion in its various manifestations. The aim is to
              create a firm algorithmic theory for the processes of acquiring, model-ing,
              reasoning about, planning, manipulating, or executing motion and their relevant
              complexity measures.
