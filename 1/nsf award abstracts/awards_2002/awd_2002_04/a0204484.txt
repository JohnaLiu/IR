Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2002.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "New procedures for modelling the thermal environment of small animals."  The
              spatial and temporal distribution of thermal resources across landscapes
              influences the abundance and distribution of organisms.  Existing techniques to
              evaluate thermal habitats do not adequately represent the complexity of most
              environments. Novel procedures are being developed to generate detailed,
              dynamic, thermal maps using artificial neural networks that incorporate
              thermographic imaging and microclimate data.
