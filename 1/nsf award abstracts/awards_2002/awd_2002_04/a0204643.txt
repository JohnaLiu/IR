Title: Mathematical modeling of nano-patterns in electrochemical
              processes

ABSTRACT

This project is devoted to the mathematical modeling
              of nano-scale self-organization and pattern formation in electrochemical
              processes.  The focus is on (i) electroconvection during anodic dissolution and
              the growth of anodic oxide layers; (ii) the growth and stability of pores in
              dielectric and semiconductor layers; (iii) the stability and nonlinear dynamics
              of pattern formation at solid-solid interfaces in the presence of chemical
              reactions, electric field, and elastic stresses.  Mathematical techniques to be
              used are linear stability and bifurcation analysis, asymptotic analysis, as
              well as numerical implementations of boundary integral methods, phase-field
              models, and level-set methods for free-boundary problems.

From the
              scientific point of view, the research is aimed at understanding the basic
              physico-chemical mechanisms responsible for the formation of highly regular
              nano-scale patterns in electrochemical systems.  The goal of this project is to
              develop mathematical models of the most important processes leading to
              self-organization (pattern formation) on the nano-scale.  These mathematical
              models can be used in numerical simulations and thus enable the creation of a
              new generation of electronic, opto-electronic, and magneto-electronic devices. 
              From the educational point of view, the proposed project, being essentially
              interdisciplinary and devoted to the cutting edge of modern science and
              technology, will attract graduate students who will be able to acquire
              knowledge and research experience in several interconnecting scientific
              disciplines and become capable of carrying out interdisciplinary
              research.
