This is a U.S.-China joint workshop proposal on sediment
              transport and environmental studies submitted by Dr. Charles Melching,
              Marquette University, in cooperation with Dr. Zhao-Yin Wang, Tsinghua
              University, Beijing, China. The meeting will be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in
              July 2002.  This is the second of the two workshops on river sediment related
              problems.  The first was on sediment transport and sediment-induced disasters
              in Beijing, China in March 1999.  The topic of the second workshop is important
              and could contribute to the U.S.-China cooperation on research concerning
              remediation of comtaminated sediments and restoration of river ecosystems.  The
              NSF and the Natural Science Foundation of China jointly support this
              workshop.
