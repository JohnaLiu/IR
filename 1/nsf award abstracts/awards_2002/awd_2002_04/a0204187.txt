Abstract    :
              This proposal is concerned with the effect of curvature bounds on
the local
              geometric properties and global topology of Riemannian
manifolds with various
              sectional and Ricci curvature bounds and
of their Gromov-Hausdorff limits. The
              principal investigators
will study the structure of the singularities that
              spaces
satisfying some natural geometric assumptions can
develop.
              Understanding the structure of such singularities can
often give a lot of
              information about the topological properties
of such spaces. They will study
              the structure of Gromov-Hausdorff
limits of manifolds with Ricci curvature
              bounded below; topology
of convergence with lower sectional curvature bound;
              the
structures of the fundamental groups for manifolds with lower
curvature
              bound; optimal bound of isoperimetric constant;
obstructions to nonnegative
              curvature on simply-connected
manifolds.

Geometric objects such as
              manifolds appear naturally in science
and engineering, as configuration
              spaces, as Einsten's model of
universe. Ricci curvature is a fundamental
              concept in Einstein's
general relativity. Thus the fundamental research in
              these area
should not only be important in its own right but also should
have
              implications in physics and engineering.
