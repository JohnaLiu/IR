              ABSTRACT DMS - 0204177.  PI: Peter Petersen

The PI proposes to investigate
              manifolds with integral curvature bounds as opposed 
to the usual pointwise
              curvature bounds. Many traditional results carry over, 
but people do not have
              a complete picture of what can go wrong with the weaker 
curvature
              assumptions. The second and main part of the proposal addresses the specific
              
but very hard question of which 3-sphere bundles over the 4-sphere have
              positive curvature. 
Only one of these spaces, namely the 7-sphere, is know to
              have positive curvature. 
We expect that several exotic spheres of this type
              have positive curvature and also that 
we will get some interesting infinite
              families of manifolds in dimensions 6 and 7 out of
this project.

The PI is
              proposing to work on two separate projects. The first deals with gleaning
              
information from objects where one has fuzzy rather than specific assumptions
              about 
how they curve. The PI has already established some interesting results
              in this direction, 
but much is still unknown. The second and more ambitious
              part is an investigation of 
how round one can make twisted objects. Here one
              imagines a sphere as perfectly round and
 untwisted. There are no intuitive
              examples in the dimensions that can be visualized,
 but in dimension 7 there
              apear to be several objects which are not spheres but still 
could be fairly
              round. A positive solution to this problem would solve one very prominent
              
problem and two lesser known problems.
