              ABSTRACT DMS - 0204190.

The principal investigator is interested in concrete 
              problems 
in classical differential geometry and topology of curves and
              
surfaces in Euclidean space, specially  those which involve some notion of
              convexity. 
The proposed investigations include:  (i) Certain nodal domains
              (shadows) cast on 
a surface by  vectorfields which correspond to  natural
              transformations, and developing 
the applications of these for surfaces of
              constant mean curvature, and surfaces whose 
gauss map satisfies a
              two-piece-property; (ii) Closed curves without parallel tangent lines
(skew
              loops) and their relation to  quadric surfaces; (iii) Global properties
              of
locally convex surfaces with boundary, including connections with
              Monge-Ampere
equations, and a convex hull property which is dual to that of
              minimal surfaces;
(iv) Existence and regularity of certain deformations of
              space curves (unfoldings)
to study extremals of knot energies and
              distortion.


The study of curves and surfaces  has been the primary
              motivation
 for the development of much of differential geometry and geometric
              topology, which in 
turn has found significant applications in physical
              sciences.  Notions of convexity have 
often proved fruitful for solving
              problems in this area, specially those which involve 
optimizing various
              quantities.  Those aspects of the principal investigator's work dealing 
with
              shadows on illuminated surfaces is motivated in part by a study of soap films
              and
may lead to applications for computer vision. Further, the investigations
              on knot
energies may be of interest in studying the DNA. The primary
              motivation of the
investigator, however, is based on aesthetic considerations
              and the intuitive
visual appeal of low dimensional geometric problems.
