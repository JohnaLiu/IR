Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2002.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "The directionality of acoustic communication in passerine birds."  The goal of
              the research is to develop a system for mapping the radiation of sound from
              vocalizing animals.  The system is to be used to measure the directionality of
              different call types from passerine birds in open and forest habitats, and to
              test hypotheses about the functional significance of directionality in acoustic
              communication.
