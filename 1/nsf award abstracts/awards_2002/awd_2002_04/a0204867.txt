Abstract    :
              Information Technology will be playing an important role in addressing the
              research problems relevant to national security.  The National Science
              Foundation will be calling upon its research communities to focus their
              research efforts on problems relating to national security.  NSF has identified
              current projects that are important to this area, including but not limited to
              the following:  Knowledge Discovery and Dissemination (datamining, knowledge
              representation, and knowledge sharing) and Biological Defense (bioinformatics,
              biosensing, pathogen normalcy baselining).  This workshop is designed to bring
              selected university researchers together with NSF and other appropriate
              government staff to communicate their needs and get community input.  CNRI will
              hold the workshop in order to assess some of the current programs and projects,
              gather government input, identify which projects hold the most relevance to the
              mission, and help identify new areas of research.
