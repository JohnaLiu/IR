              ABSTRACT DMS - 0204650.

We plan to study isoperimetric inequalities for
              Dirichlet eigenvalues of
biharmonic operator in dimensions greater than 3, for
              the sums of reciprocals
Neumann eigenvalues, for the Willmore functional of a
              surface, isoperimetric
inequalities for Dirichlet Laplacian with Bonnesen type
              term.

By isoperimetric inequality we mean any inequality relating two or
              more domain
functionals (defined on the same domain) which is such that the
              equality sign
actually holds for some domain of the class under consideration
              (or in some
appropriate limiting sense). There are still some open fundamental
              questions in
this classical area.
