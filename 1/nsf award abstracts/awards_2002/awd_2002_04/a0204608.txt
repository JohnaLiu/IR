Abstract    :
              The work in this proposal is aimed at furthering our understanding of the basic
              laws and forces of nature. New ideas and techniques in string theory will be
              developed. String theory is currently the most succesful attempt to combine
              quantum mechanics and gravity into a unified framework with the strong, weak
              and electormagnetic forces.

The standard model of particle physics has had
              many experimental successes, but it must be replaced by a more complete theory
              at higher energies. Supersymmetry, a relation between particles with different
              spin, is an important ingredient in many theories of particle physics at higher
              energy scales. This work should lead to new insights into the role of
              supersymmetry in string theory and particle physics. This work is also likely
              to have applications to areas of mathematics concerned with geometry and
              singularities.
