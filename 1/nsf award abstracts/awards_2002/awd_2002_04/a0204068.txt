Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2002.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "The effect of winter variability on biodiversity and community dynamics:
              analysis of long-term lake data."  Strong contrast between winter and summer
              abiotic conditions annually provides distinctly different habitat within one
              location, promoting biodiversity. To determine effects of reducing this
              environmental heterogeneity, this research uses multispecies autoregressive
              analysis (MARs) to analyze complex seasonal community transitions, discerning
              biotic pathways through which winter conditions affect both summer and winter
              communities.
