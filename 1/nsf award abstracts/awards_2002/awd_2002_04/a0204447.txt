Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2002.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Using Geographic Information Systems in spatially explicit analyses of
              population genetic structure."  This research uses geographic information
              systems (GIS) to explore methods that incorporate explicit environmental
              information in distributional analyses of genetic variation within species. 
              The investigations are focused in Southern California, where previous research
              has produced detailed environmental data layers and many genetic data sets for
              species in similar functional groups.  It is being determined the extent to
              which landscape-level processes influence the creation, distribution, and
              maintenance of genetic biodiversity across this region.
