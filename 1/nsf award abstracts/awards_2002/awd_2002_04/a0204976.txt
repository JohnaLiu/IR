Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) are the dominant sites of
              star formation in the Galaxy, yet the nature and distribution of their young
              stellar content has yet to be thoroughly or systematically investigated due to
              the large distances to and large angular sizes of the clouds. Dr. Elizabeth
              Lada and her colleagues, at the University of Florida, have been awarded
              roughly 200 nights of "survey" time allocated over 5 years from the National
              Optical Astronomy Observatories. This extremely large allocation of time on the
              2.1-m and 4-m telescopes at Kitt Peak will be used to study the full mass range
              of young stars within nearby GMCs.  These researchers are using the world's
              first near-IR multi-object spectrometer called FLAMINGOS, to obtain sensitive
              near-IR imaging surveys and for the first time extensive near-IR spectral
              classifications for stars in GMCs. The survey observations will provide a
              statistically significant census of near-infrared sources within the nearest
              giant star forming molecular clouds to a depth and completeness unequaled by
              any other existing or planned survey. A complete catalog of the near-IR
              photometry and spectroscopy for all sources will be constructed and provided to
              the entire astronomical community. This database will provide a unique and
              valuable resource for studies of star formation and molecular clouds using both
              ground based optical and radio telescopes (e.g. Gemini & ALMA) and space
              missions (e.g. SIRTF, Chandra & XMM).
