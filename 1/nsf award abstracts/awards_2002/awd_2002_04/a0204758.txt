Abstract    :
              The nature of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City
              demonstrates the need for understanding the interdependencies between physical
              infrastructure and social networks. The benefits of such understanding may
              include possible recommendations on modifying the design of the physical
              infrastructures to improve their resilience to catastrophic disruptions. Models
              of social networks relying on wireless and wired communication infrastructures
              would allow the development and testing of efficient algorithms to determine
              critical blocks in the infrastructures, whose distraction will adversely affect
              the communication traffic inside of and among social networks. This research
              project will use the graph-theoretic approach to model social networks and
              their reliance on physical infrastructures, focusing mainly on social networks
              in the New York City area and the providing infrastructures, including
              telephone networks, towers for the wireless communication, transportation and
              emergency services. This knowledge will be used to identify opportunities for
              reducing vulnerabilities, developing countermeasures to mitigate the impact of
              disruptions, and guiding actions for timely response and discovery.
