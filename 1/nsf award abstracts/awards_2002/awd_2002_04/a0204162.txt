Abstract    :
              Systems where components share information and resources
indiscriminately are
              often fragile. Conversely, the control of sharing
contributes to modularity,
              reliability, and security. Java, C#, and
other modern programming languages
              rely on sophisticated concepts and
methods for controlling sharing. These are
              embodied in constructs such
as locks, abstract data types, and unforgeable
              object references, and
in type systems and static analyses. 

This project
              aims to study and develop techniques for controlled
sharing in programming
              languages. For this purpose, it relies on the
development of foundational
              calculi (e.g., calculi of objects or
processes). It focuses on capabilities
              (such as unforgeable
references), on related "packaging" constructs (such as
              objects and
abstract data types), and on disciplines for the safe use of
              run-time
mechanisms for controlled sharing.
