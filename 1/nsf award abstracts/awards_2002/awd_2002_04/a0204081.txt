		ABSTRACT

Research will be
              conducted on continuous dynamical systems on
manifolds of dimension three and
              higher, with emphasis on 
compact invariant subsets on which the flow is
              minimal. 
Continuing the work related to the real analytic solution to 
the
              Seifert conjecture on aperiodic flows acting on the 
three-dimensional sphere,
              the PI plans to classify the minimal 
sets in such flows with respect to their
              homological and shape 
theory properties. Minimal sets shape-equivalent (in
              the sense
of Borsuk) to a polyhedron often appear in flows as
attractors, and
              are of special interest. Minimal sets of 
non-polyhedral shape are usually
              approximated by circular 
orbits or by other movable sets with the so called
              UV-property.
They have very complicated dynamics around them, which can be
              
investigated through the structure of the family of the 
approximating
              invariant sets. Circular orbits are extremely
important in celestial mechanics
               as they appear as paths of 
movement. Smaller particles, dust,  can align
              along a braided 
orbit, and in the continuous  case,  in a mathematical model,
              
this "orbit" could be an invariant set,  aperiodic but 
"circle-like", or
              "graph-like" such as the 
well-known Denjoy continua. A volume-preserving
              dynamical system, 
associated with incompressible fluids, imposes restrictions
              on 
the flow outside the special invariant collection and is an 
important
              area of study as well.  

The theory of dynamical systems was developed in an
              effort to
provide a mathematically rigorous description of real physical
              
phenomena. It is therefore closely connected to many domains 
of science:
              mechanics, various areas of physics, biology, and 
economics.  Dynamical
              systems connect several branches of 
mathematics such as analysis, topology,
              geometry, algebra, 
and combinatorics.
