Abstract    :
                   The adequate numerical treatment of nonlinear phenomena
governed by
              partial differential equations with several disparate
scales is a formidable
              computational challenge.  Modern algorithms
should be able to resolve fine
              scales for certain physical
quantities without overresolving others, thereby
              optimizing the
computational effort and making realistic 3d
              simulations
feasible.  Epitaxial and crystal growth in materials science,
              and
viscous incompressible fluids are typical yet quite distinct
examples
              addressed in this proposal.  The goal of this project is
to design, test, and
              analyze reliable and efficient adaptive
finite element methods for such
              problems, with space-time error
control and based on refinement/coarsening
              mesh modification.
This project blends quite delicate analytical and
              computational
issues, and applies them to free boundary problems,
              constrained
problems, geometric PDE and the Navier-Stokes equations
              of
incompressible fluids.
     Scientific computing has joined theory and
              experiment to
form together the three central aspects of scientific
              inquiry.
The current strengths in computational mathematics draw on
              the
widespread acceptance of computational modeling as a complement
to, and
              even a replacement for, physical tests in a broad number
of fields.  In this
              vein, the investigator develops reliable and
efficient computational tools
              that may be useful in several areas
of strategic importance such as
              nanotechnology, materials
science, and high-performance computing.  This
              project is a
collaborative endeavor, involving a number of scientists in
              the
US and abroad, as well as several students and postdocs.  A
substantial
              effort is devoted to education and human resource
development.
