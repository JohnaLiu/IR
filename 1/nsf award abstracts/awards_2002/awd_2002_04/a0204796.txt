              Organizational Facilitators and Inhibitors to Information-Sharing Across
              Federal Agency Boundaries

This small grant will study the organizational
              facilitators and inhibitors to sharing of information across government
              agencies.  This testbed is an existing multi-agency group working on the topic
              of Adaptive Management Areas of the national forests in the Northwest US. 
              Participating agencies are the US Department of Agriculture and the US
              Department of the Interior.  This multi-agency group also collaborates on a
              multi-agency portal with another Oregon Graduate Institute grantee of the
              Digital Government program, thus providing a natural collaboration between the
              disciplines of computer science and social science.
