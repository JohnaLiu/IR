The San Andreas Fault zone
              Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) Pilot Hole will provide an
excellent opportunity
              for exploring the relationship between fault slip and the thermal evolution
of
              the crust by studying core samples from varying depths using two
              complementary
thermochronologic methods. The Pilot Hole, located in Parkfield
              less than two kilometers from
the San Andreas fault will reach a depth of 2.1
              km. The borehole will intersect Salinian granitic
rocks at a depth of less
              than 1 km and similar granitic rocks outcrop at the surface within a
              few
kilometers of the Pilot Hole. We will analyze samples from borehole
              cuttings at depth intervals
of 100 - 200 m and from the surface outcrops. We
              will determine the thermal history of the
samples using apatite fission track
              and U/Th-He thermochronometers.
