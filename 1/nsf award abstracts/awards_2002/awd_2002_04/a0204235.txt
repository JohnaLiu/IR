Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for
              FY2002.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of
              protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are
              not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides
              opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in
              microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of
              established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the
              research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These
              fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their
              research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves
              of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign
              locations. 

The research and training plan is entitled "Microarray analysis
              to discover light-quality regulated genes in the cyanobacteria Fremyella
              diplosiphon."  Microarrays allow researchers to analyze global gene expression.
               Fremyella diplosiphon has an adaptive response to light color called
              complementary chromatic adaptation (CCA).  However, only three operons have
              been identified as regulated by light color.  This research uses microarrays of
              PCR amplified genomic fragments to discover novel genes that are light color
              regulated and then uses gene-specific microarrays to examine the expression
              kinetics of these genes.
