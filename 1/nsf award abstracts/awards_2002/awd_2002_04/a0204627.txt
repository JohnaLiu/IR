Since the introduction of quantum
              invariants of three dimensional
manifolds the fact that these invariants are
              only defined at roots of
unity has been an obstruction to analyzing their
              properties.  However,
there is ample evidence that quantum invariants of three
              manifolds
exist as holomorphic functions on the unit disk that
              diverge
everywhere on the unit circle but at roots of unity.  The
              investigator
uses the results of her previous research to study further
              quantum
invariants and to find additional applications of that research
              to
classical 3-manifold topology. Specifically, she works on the problem
of
              extending the parametric domain of the quantum 3-manifold
invariants beyond
              roots of unity. She also studies the application of
quantum topology to
              detecting symmetries of 3--manifolds and to
answering questions relating to
              Dehn surgery on knots.


Quantum topology is a rapidly developing area of
              mathematics that
brings together ideas from physics, algebra, geometry
              and
topology. This theory has produced a wealth of new invariants for
three
              dimensional manifolds. Three-manifolds are objects which locally
look like the
              common 3-dimensional space we live in, and "topological
invariants" are
              numbers which can be associated to manifolds that
encode some information
              about their structure and help to classify
them. The investigator works on one
              of the fundamental problems in
this area, namely that of finding topological
              interpretations for
these new invariants.
