This award
              provides partial support for active research mathematicians 
to attend a
              program in general relativity  to be held at Stanford
University and the
              American Institute of Mathematics in the spring quarter
(April 1-June 7)  of
              2002. The main topic of the conference concerns
aspects of the Cauchy problem
              for the Einstein equations, and it will
include researchers with expertise in
              differential geometry, nonlinear
hyperbolic PDE, and relativity theory. There
              will be approximately 50
total visitors averaging two weeks each during the
              period of the workshop 
together with a few people for longer periods. Focus
              periods on
specific subtopics will be arranged. The program will include
              regular
talks, lecture series on particular papers and topics, and
              open
problem sessions. In addition, we will create a web site for the
              program
which will give a detailed look at open problems, relevant
              literature,
background references, and links to preprints and reprints.
              Further
information will be linked from http://math.stanford.edu
              and
