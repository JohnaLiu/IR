Title: A
              Social-Technical Approach to the Evolutionary Construction of Reusable Software
              Component Repositories PIs: Gerhard Fischer and Yunwen Ye 
Although software
              reuse improves both the quality and productivity of software development,
              systematic reuse has not yet met its expected success due to difficulties in
              creating and maintaining reuse repositories and enabling software developers to
              build new systems with components from the reuse repository. The two issues are
              in a deadlock: if software developers are unable to reuse, the investments on
              reuse cannot be justified; if companies are unwilling to invest in reuse,
              software developers have little to reuse.  This project takes a
              social-technical approach to address both issues. It will develop
              reuse-conducive environments based on the Seeding, Evolutionary Growth, and
              Reseeding (SER) model to guide thedevelopment and evolution of reuse
              repositories. It will instantiate the conceptual framework for reuse by
              creating a set of tools to support each phase of the SER model: SEEDER, BROKER,
              ENHANCER, and RESEEDER.  This research will create a new understanding of the
              social, cognitive, and technical issues in software reuse, and explore new
              approaches and develop innovative tools to support reuse. The results of the
              research will make a significant impact on the design of information repository
              systems and human-centered software development environments.
