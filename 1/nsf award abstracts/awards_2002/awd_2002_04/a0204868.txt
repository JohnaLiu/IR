The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will support a twenty-four month research
              fellowship by Dr. Andrew J. Logan to work with Dr. Petter D. Jenssen at the
              Agricultural University of Norway and with Dr. Trond Mahlum at the Norwegian
              Centre for Soil and Environmental Research in Aas, Norway.

This project will
              explore the physical/chemical nature of soil treatment systems by measuring the
              changing hydrophobicity with depth and operation time and define how these
              changes affect pathogen collection.  Pathogen surrogates including virus and
              bacteria, will be introduced to vessels and allowed to contact granular media
              with differing hydrophobicities.  Collection behavior will then be measured and
              the treatment efficiency of the systems will be measured relative to pathogen
              removal.  Results from this research can be used to provide a strategy for the
              construction and operation of such treatment systems to optimize pathogen
              collection and minimize the risk of pathogen discharge to groundwater.

At
              these two institutions, current research includes developing enhanced treatment
              systems for domestic wastewater, exploring the effects of wastewater
              application regime on the treatment efficiency of soil-based systems, and
              investigating pathogen transport in porous media.
