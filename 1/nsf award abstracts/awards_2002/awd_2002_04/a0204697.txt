Abstract    :
              This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research by James Mayer, Department of Chemistry, University of
              Washington, in the fundamental processes of transition metal-promoted
              oxidations. The properties and reactivity of a new osmium compound,
              tris(pyrazolyl)borate osmium dioxo nitride will be studied. This compound has
              shown olefin dihydroxylation activity. Novel electrophilic reactions of
              coordinated ligands will be explored, starting from the unique attack of an
              anilido ligand bound to osmium. Mayer will also extend his work into high
              oxidation state ruthenium and iridium complexes. In these strongly oxidizing
              complexes, ligands that are usually electrophiles act as nucleophiles and show
              unusual reactivity.

The selective oxidation of organic compounds by
              transition metal reagents and catalysts is of fundamental and technological
              importance. Selective oxidation is a key part of the production of many
              commodity chemicals, specialty organic chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and there
              is much room for improvement in these processes. Undergraduate and graduate
              students will also be trained in this important research area that combines
              synthetic and mechanistic chemistry.
