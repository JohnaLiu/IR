This grant continues the successful Design Projects'
              activities supported by award 9707720 in which students design and build custom
              projects for individual persons with disabilities. The objectives of the
              program are to enhance engineering education, provide students with insight
              into careers in rehabilitation, improve the quality of life of people with
              disabilities, and serve the community. The projects meet special needs of
              individual disabled persons not addressed by commercial devices.  

Students
              from four engineering disciplines participate in the Design Projects activity:
              Mechanical Engineering; Electrical and Computer Engineering; Industrial
              Engineering; Biomedical Engineering. (ETL) student project devices and systems
              are being used daily at schools and businesses throughout southeastern
              Michigan.  ETL is part of a consortium of eight Regional Educational Service
              Agencies, representing eight counties in southeastern Michigan (termed Region
              IV) and the majority of ideas for student design projects come from teachers
              working at schools within that Region.  
 
Descriptions of completed design
              projects are found in the Annual Review of Design Projects at
