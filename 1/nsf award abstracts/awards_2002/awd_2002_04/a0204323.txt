Abstract    :
              Execution of distributed applications over the Internet involves method
              invocations on remote objects and coordination tasks.  This proposal addresses
              the task coordination problem by (1) limiting the model of computation to tree
              structured concurrency, and (2) assuming that there is an environment that
              provides sacilities for remote method invocation on distributted objects,
              persistent storage,and computation using standard function library.  Tree
              structured concurrency permits only restricted communications among the tasks:
              a task may spawn children task and all communications are between parents and
              their children. It can be shown that such structure communication, though less
              powerful than interactions in process networks, are sufficient to solve most
              problems of interest, and they avoid many of the problems associated with
              concurrency.  The broader impact of this research will be to (1) design a
              theory for restricted class of concurrent computing, which still exhibits the
              power to solve a variety of task coordination problems, and (2) develop
              prototype implementations that allow non-programmers to develop with ease
              distributed applications on the Internet.
