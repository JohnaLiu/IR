       On the Geometry of
              Kaehler-Einstein Manifold

In this project, the proposer is going to
              understand
Kaehler-Einstein metrics, especially Calabi-Yau manifolds
using
              the theory of moduli spaces, through three different
ways. The first way is to
              study the potential function of
the Bergman metric of a polarized compact  
              Kaehler
manifold.  For the application in the Kaehler-Einstein
geometry, one
              needs to estimate the potential function from
below for a family of manifolds.
              The problem is related to
the stability of manifolds in the sense of
              Geometric
Invariant Theory. The second way is to study the relation
between
              the K stability and the Mumford stability.  Such a
relation, if exists, would
              give one new insights of the
relations  between the Kaehler-Einstein geometry
              and the
stability of manifolds. The third way  is the geometry of
moduli
              space of polarized Calabi-Yau manifolds.  A Kaehler
metric on the moduli space
              has been defined  and was found
that the Ricci curvature of such a metric is
              negative away
from zero by the proposer. In order to introduce
              geometric
analysis to the place, one needs to prove a version of the
maximal
              principle on the moduli space, even if the moduli
space, in general, is not
              smooth.

Einstein's general theory of relativity is a theory that
interprets
              the concept of gravity into the geometric
property of the space.  Recent
              development  of in physics
shows that the universe may be  of dimension ten,
              with three
dimension in space and one  dimension in time plus a tiny
six 
              dimensional space called  Calabi-Yau threefold. One of
the main mathematical
              tool to study the geometry of the
space is differential geometry. Since the
              discovery of the
general relativity, differential geometry becomes crucial
              to
both mathematicians and physicists. The project is one of
the main field
              in differential geometry. It will help a lot
in understanding one of the basic
              force of the universe: the
gravity and ultimately understanding the space we
              are living
with. It is difficult to believe that without an extensive
study
              of fundamental sciences such as general relativity,
modern technology like the
              use of atomic energy can come
true. By the same reason, today's fundamental
              study will not
only enlarge our knowledge but eventually benefit
              people's
life as well.
