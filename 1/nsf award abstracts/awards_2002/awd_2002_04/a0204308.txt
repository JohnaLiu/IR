This award supports graduate students from US universities to
              participate in a special program on partial differential equations and spectral
              theory at the Mittag-Leffler Institute in Djursholm, Sweden.  The workshop will
              provide a unique opportunity for young mathematicians to develop collaborations
              with their counterparts from Sweden, as well as with leaders in the field from
              all of Scandinavia.  The theme of the program is the interaction between
              partial differential equations and spectral theory, and applications to
              microlocal analysis and Schrodinger operators.  The Mittag-Leffler Institute is
              a world-renowned mathematics research institute located near Stockholm.  The
              Institute has a research building with offices, conference room, and up-to-date
              library, and apartments for researchers are located on campus.  As a result,
              the Institute is an ideal place for in-depth and collaborative mathematical
              study and provides an optimal milieu for fostering collaboration.  The Fall
              2002 Program is the third such program on differential equations and spectral
              theory held at the Institute, two others having been held in 1982 and 1992.
