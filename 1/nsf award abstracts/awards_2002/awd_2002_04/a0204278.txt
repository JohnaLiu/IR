Abstract    :
              The research component of the proposal is to devise automatic macromodeling
              procedures that extract higher-level models from detailed lower-level ones for
              automated design of Systems-on-Chip.  An important aspect of this process,
              particularly for analog, mixed-signal and RF modules, is the incorporation of
              nonlinearities.  This is essential for distortion and intermodulation
              characteristics.  

This work is concerned chiefly with modeling weak circuit
              nonlinearities.  A significane increase in the predicted fidelity over current
              (essentially linear theory-based) procedures is expected.  The proposed work is
              based on Volterra non-linear series expansion that captures essential
              non-linearities of a broad class of devices which include power amplifiers,
              mixers, frequency doublers, and switched-capacitor filters.  The work is likely
              to be expandable to companding filters and Analog-to-Digital converters.
