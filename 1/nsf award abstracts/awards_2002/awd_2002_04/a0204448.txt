The main subject of our proposal
              in the geometry and topology of group
actions on symplectic and contact
              manifolds.  The underlying theme is
that these symmetries offer a very
              powerful tool for classifying or
computing invariants of such manifolds.  More
              specifically, ideas that
we will investigate include: the cohomology of
              symplectic quotients by
loop groups, the cohomology of contact quotients,
              highly symmetric    
manifolds, the Gromov width of coadjoint orbits, the
              topology of the
group of symplectomorphisms, uniruled symplectic
              manifolds,
foundational work on group actions on contact manifolds,
              the
relationship between completely integrable systems and toric
              contact
manifolds, and explicit constructions of special metrics on
              contact
manifolds.

The goal of the project is to further our understanding
              of two
important types of geometry --- symplectic and contact. 
              Both
geometries have their origins in mechanics and optics and are
currently
              of interest to physicists investigating string theories.
