Abstract    :
               The objectives of this work involve a detailed experimental and theoretical
              analysis of the atmospheric oxidation chemistry of isoprene.  Isoprene is the
              major unsaturated organic compound emitted into the atmosphere by vegetation. 
              Product analysis and kinetic studies will be performed on reactions of isoprene
              with oxygen and nitrogen radicals.  These experimental results will be compared
              to theoretical predictions of yields and rates for these same reactions. 
              Oxygen and nitrogen radical competititve reactions with isoprene will also be
              studied and the combined results used to develop a mechanistic understanding of
              isoprene oxidation reactions. 
 
With this award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the Atmospheric Chemistry Program are
              supporting the research of Dr. Simon W. North and Dr. Renyi Zhang of the
              Department of Chemistry at Texas A & M University.  Drs. North and Zhang will
              work on a detailed study of the atmospheric oxidation chemistry of isoprene.  
              Isoprene is the major unsaturated organic compound emitted into the atmosphere
              by vegetation.  A better understanding of how isoprene interacts with reactive
              oxygen and nitrogen species in our atmosphere could help future efforts to
              model and predict:  1) the role isoprene levels play in ozone formation; 2)
              long range transport of organic nitrates; and 3) carbon cycling in the
              atmosphere. Students trained during the course of this work will gain
              experience in environmental, atmospheric and organic chemistry.
