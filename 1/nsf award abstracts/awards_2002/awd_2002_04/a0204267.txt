Title:   The Research Component of a Model IT College


This ITWF
              award provides support to the University of Arkansas, Little Rock to use the
              tools of IT to serve the educational enterprise in the same way that these
              tools support business enterprises. In 1999 the state of Arkansas recognized
              the shortage of IT workers and created the College of Information Science and
              Systems Engineering, called the Cyber-college of Arkansas, at the University of
              Arkansas at Little Rock.  The Cyber-college will design a database that will
              house data on every facet of the college's recruitment and first-year student
              experience across four computer-based four-year degree programs.  The database
              will:

provide a test-bed for conclusions derived from demographic and
              pedagogic research from other studies.

be mined for new associations and
              clusters of experience and behavior patterns that will suggest research in new
              directions.

provide data on the IT students of Arkansas and on the efficacy
              of the various strategies that the Cyber-college has implement to achieve its
              mission.

prototype recruitment and retention databases that could be
              installed in other IT college and thereby contribute an important tool to
              further the understanding of the efforts of IT colleges to serve
              underrepresented population groups.

Once built, this dynamic data model will
              be sustained within the Cyber-college and the data that it collects and the
              analysis that it engenders will provide insight to the longitudinal problem of
              maintaining the supply of college-trained professionals in the IT workforce
              nationally.
