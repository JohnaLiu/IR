We propose to continue our investigations
              in several versions 
of "functorial calculus". Each of these is a technique
              that 
exploits multirelative connectivity estimates to describe 
continuous
              functors in some context in terms of special values; 
for example a functor of
              spaces might be recovered from its 
values at highly connected spaces, or a
              functor of subspaces 
of a manifold from its values at low-dimensional
              subspaces, or
a functor of real inner product spaces from its values at
              high-dimensional spaces. Part of the proposal is to refine 
the purely
              homotopy-theoretic version of "calculus". Other 
parts are concerned with
              combining several versions and 
applying them to various questions in both
              high- and
low-dimensional differential topology.

Each "functorial calculus"
              mentioned above is so called 
because of a not-entirely-fanciful resemblance
              to the 
ordinary diferential calculus of Newton and Leibniz. 
Sometimes a
              fact about numbers is best proved by placing 
it in a context where the number
              is part of a huge family of
numbers -- a numerical function. Properties of the
              function 
then lead, by general theorems of calculus that may seem a 
bit
              magical when encountered for the first time, to a 
computation of the number.
              So it is here: sometimes a fact 
about some geometrically defined object is
              best proved by
placing it in a context where the object is part of a huge
              
family of such objects -- a functor -- and using some magic 
of a more
              modern kind. This analogy may show something of 
the flavor of the work; the
              content is harder to get at, 
because most of the "geometric" objects in
              question are
connected to everyday reality by rather long chains of 
abstract
              ideas.
