Abstract    :
              Several lines of evidence suggest that there exists a strong analogy between
              natural languages and biological sequences, i.e. there appear to be
              organism-specific words, phrases and paragraphs in the collective of proteins
              encoded by the genomes of fully sequenced organisms.  It is proposed that the
              biological analogy of meaning in a natural text is the ability of a protein
              sequence to fold into its functional three-dimensional fold.  In natural
              languages, frequent words carry little meaning, while rare words often allow
              identification of the topic of a particular text.  The hypothesis predicts,
              therefore, that rare stretches of amino acids indicate the location of folding
              initiators.  The distribution of global properties along the sequence of
              lysozyme, a model protein for protein folding studies, indicated that features
              in these properties can be recognized when inverse frequencies of amino acid
              n-grams were plotted, supporting the analogy to natural languages.  In the next
              12 months the focus will be on studying the distribution of rare n-grams in the
              human genome.  If a correlation between folding domains and distribution of
              rare n-grams can be established, this would (i) provide compelling support for
              the hypothesis and (ii) shed light on one of the major unsolved questions in
              biology today, the mechanism by which functional three-dimensional structures
              are formed from a one-dimensional sequence of amino acids.
