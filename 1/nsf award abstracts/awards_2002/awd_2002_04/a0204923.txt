This is a 36 month project submitted by Dr. Yang Wang,
              Florida State University with Professor DENG Tao, Institute of Vertebrate
              Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, CAS, China, to study isotopic evidence for
              late Cenozoic climate and ecosystem changes in China. They propose to collect
              isotopic evidence of the expansion of C4 plants in China, and to see whether
              this expansion corresponds to the late Miocene C4 plant expansion noted in
              America, Africa, Pakistan and Nepal.  This project will advance our knowledge
              of the timing and extent of the global C4 grassland expansion in the late
              Cenozoic.  The long-term climate data collected in the course of this project
              can fill a data gap for the area adjacent to the Tibetan plateau.  A U.S.
              graduate student and undergraduate student will benefit considerably from
              collaborating with the Chinese scientists and from the experience of working on
              this research in China.  The NSF and the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly
              support this project.
