Complex variables
              form the basis for virtually every aspect of modern science, and
              complex
projective spaces are the home to the rich world of objects and
              structures that arise from com-plex
variables. Yet attempts to depict
              geometric aspects of these spaces have been scarce due the
prodigious
              difficulty of higher dimensional visualization and poor understanding of the
              wealth of
relevant problems that touch on complex projective spaces. Modern
              computer technology provides
a number of very significant new tools  symbolic
              manipulation programs, numerical optimiza-tion
programs, and interactive
              computer graphics visualizations that can provide powerful as-sistance
for the
              human mathematical intellect. The benefits of exploiting these tools fall into
              two
major categories: (i) lowering the bar, so to speak, so that a larger
              number of people, possibly
even interested lay persons, can understand the
              significance and excitement of previously inacces-sible
mathematical concepts;
              and (ii) raising the potential level of research attainment to allow
              the
solution of problems that would be nearly impossible using conventional
              mathematical research
methods.
