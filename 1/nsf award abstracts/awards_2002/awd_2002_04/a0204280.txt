Abstract    :
              Many computation problems, including program analysis and model checking
              problems in particular, are most clearly and easily specified using realtional
              rules.  Yet, developing and implementing efficient algorithms for these
              problems is a nontrivial, recurring task.  This project proposes to develop a
              unified method for transformaing rule-based specifications and transformations
              to provide both time and space guarantees for the derived algorithms. We will
              focus in particular on rule-based specifications for program analysis and model
              checking problems and develop fully automatic methods for the transforamtions
              and the time and space analysis in this domain.
