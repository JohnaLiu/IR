This project involves the development and
              application of new
enumerative invariants in low-dimensional, symplectic, and
              contact
topology.  There are two main goals.  The first is to develop
              and
compute ``periodic Floer homology'', a theory defined for
              an
area-preserving surface diffeomorphism, which counts periodic
              orbits
together with embedded pseudoholomorphic curves in R cross the
              mapping
torus.  This theory is conjectured to agree with the
              Seiberg-Witten
Floer homology of the mapping torus, thus giving a link between
              low
dimensional topology and surface dynamics.  Also, an analogue of
periodic
              Floer homology for three-dimensional contact manifolds should
have
              applications to the topology of overtwisted contact structures
and smooth
              four-manifolds.  The second main goal is to develop and
compute invariants of
              families of equivalent objects in different
versions of Floer theory.  These
              give topological invariants of
families of symplectomorphisms,
              three-manifolds, Legendrian knots, and
any other type of object for which a
              version of Floer theory can be
defined.

This project fits into the broad
              theme of developing tools to
understand the possible global shapes of three
              and four dimensional
spaces.  For example the universe we live in is a four
              dimensional
space if one includes time, and its global structure is not
              known.
The tools used here to understand the shape of a space
              involve
counting interesting geometric objects inside the space.  An
              important
class of such objects are pseudoholomorphic curves, which are
              surfaces
resembling soap films.  By counting the number of such surfaces
              with
appropriate constraints that exist in a space, one can gain
information
              about the global structure of the space.
