M. Gross plans to study the geometry of mirror
              symmetry for Calabi-Yau
manifolds. This will be done from the perspective of
              the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow
conjecture and algebro-geometric analogues of this
              conjecture currently
being developed by M. Gross and B. Siebert. These ideas
              will be pursued
with a goal of finding a general mirror symmetry construction,
              associating
to any polarized maximally unipotent degeneration of Calabi-Yau
              manifolds a mirror family
of polarized Calabi-Yau  manifolds. Implications of
              these ideas to understanding
the behaviour of Ricci-flat metrics near
              maximally unipotent degenerations
and the counting of rational curves using
              the notion of log Gromov-Witten
invariants will also be pursued.

The work
              proposed by M. Gross lies at the intersection of string theory
and geometry.
              String theory replaces the traditional notion of 
the point particle with a
              small loop of string, moving through space-time.
To make string theory
              compatible with quantum mechanics, space-time must
be ten-dimensional. Since
              space-time appears four-dimensional, one expects 
six of these dimensions to
              be a very small `curled up' geometric object. 
These geometric objects are
              called Calabi-Yau manifolds. In the early
1990s, string theorists proposed a
              remarkable association between
completely different Calabi-Yau manifolds:
              certain calculations extremely
difficult to perform on one Calabi-Yau manifold
              could be completed
by performing completely different, and much easier,
              calculations on
a different Calabi-Yau manifold. This discovery was known as
              mirror symmetry.
Since this time, many geometers have been trying to
              understand 
the mathematics behind this miraculous observation. The work of M.
              Gross
hopes to give mathematical insight and explanation for the
              phenomenon
of mirror symmetry.
