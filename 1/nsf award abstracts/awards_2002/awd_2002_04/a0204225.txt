Title: Nonlinear Problems in Conservation Laws and
              Fluid Dynamics and Related Partial Differential Equations

The investigator
              continues studies of nonlinear problems in conservation laws and fluid dynamics
              and related nonlinear partial differential equations and their applications,
              along with the analysis and development of efficient nonlinear methods. The
              objective of this research program is twofold: (1) to investigate important
              nonlinear problems such as multidimensional transonic shocks and free boundary
              problems, vacuum problems, asymptotic stability problems, compressible fluids
              with various constitutive relations, singular limit problems, multiphase
              problems, and the Riemann problem to gain new physical insights, to guide the
              formulation of efficient nonlinear methods, and to find the correct function
              spaces in which to pose the nonlinear conservation laws and develop the
              numerical methods that converge stably and rapidly; and (2) to analyze and
              develop nonlinear methods including free boundary methods, kinetic methods,
              geometric measure methods, weak convergence methods, shock capturing
              techniques, energy methods, and related potential techniques to formulate new,
              more efficient nonlinear methods and to solve various more important nonlinear
              problems in conservation laws and fluid dynamics.

The nonlinear problems and
              related partial differential equations in this research program arise in such
              areas as gas dynamics, hydraulics, combustion, magnetohydrodynamics,
              semiconductor, elasticity, multiphase flow, phase transitions, kinetic theory,
              biophysics, and material science. The award will support research on the
              solvability of these nonlinear problems and related partial differential
              equations, the qualitative behavior of their solutions and related
              applications, as well as the analysis and development of nonlinear methods in
              applied analysis and numerical analysis. This research will lead to a deeper
              understanding of nonlinear phenomena and will provide more efficient nonlinear
              methods and theories for applications.
