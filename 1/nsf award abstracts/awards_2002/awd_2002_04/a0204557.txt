In this
              continuing project we explore the implications of integrability for the Vortex
              Filament Equation, which is the simplest model of the self-induced motion of a
              slender vortex filament in an ideal fluid, and which is known to be equivalent
              to the focusing nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS).  The goals of our
              research are to relate geometric and topological properties -- in particular,
              knot types -- of large classes of closed filaments to the Floquet spectra of
              the corresponding periodic NLS solutions, and to understand how the knot type
              of a filament can change as it evolves.  The methods we employ include
              algebro-geometric constructions of multi-phase solutions, Backlund
              transformations, isoperiodic deformations, and perturbation theory. 

Our
              work is part of a larger trend of making connections between differential
              equations, which usually model physical phenomena, and knot theory, which is
              traditionally a part of pure mathematics. Here, we study a simplified model of
              vortex motion, which possesses a rich class of knotted loops among its
              solutions, and whose mathematical structure is well understood, in order to
              develop the mathematical tools necessary to effectively address questions such
              as knot formation, stability of knotted structures, and knot classification.
