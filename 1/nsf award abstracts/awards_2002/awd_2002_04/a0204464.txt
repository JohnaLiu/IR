Title:  Characteristics and Career Paths of Current IT
              Workers


This award provides support for a study that will identify
              important decision points in the educational and work experiences of
              Information Technology (IT) workers that have led them to enter and remain in
              the IT workforce.  The results of this study will document the normal patterns
              of entry and retention in the IT workforce to provide a baseline to examine the
              special problems of women and minorities who are greatly underrepresented in
              this expanding and lucrative sector of the economy.

Through a survey of both
              current IT and non-IT workers in the greater Kansas City area, the project will
              gather data on individual personality traits in conjunction with detailed
              family background, and educational and work histories.  These data will in turn
              be used to identify aspects of attitudes, family background, and educational
              and work experiences that have influenced individual decisions to enter IT
              jobs, as well as to remain in (or exit from) them.  Among IT workers the same
              data will be used to explore differences by sex, and race and ethnicity.   The
              results will illuminate both the similarities between IT and science and
              engineering career choices, and the differences.
