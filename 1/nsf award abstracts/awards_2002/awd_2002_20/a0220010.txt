This award provides travel funds for 25 U.S. scientists
              to attend the 21st Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics in Florence,
              Italy, on December 9-13, 2002.

The Texas Symposia take place every other
              year and serve as an international summary of recent developments in the main
              areas of modern astrophysics, cosmology, and relativity.  The biannual meetings
              are held in different cities in the U.S., and every second or third meeting is
              held in a foreign country.  The event in 2002 will take place in Florence,
              Italy, and will be sponsored by the newly established National Institute of
              Astrophysics (INAF), in collaboration with the National Institute of Nuclear
              Physics (INFN).
