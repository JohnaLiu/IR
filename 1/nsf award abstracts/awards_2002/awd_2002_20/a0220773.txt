In order to better understand the annual and interannual
              variability of the density structure over the Middle Atlantic Bight shelf and
              the linkages between forcing mechanisms and responses, others have studied
              temperature and salinity variability, but not the important density parameter. 
              The PIs propose to utilize, in their research, National Centers for
              Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis products and historical data from a
              variety of sources, including light ships, buoys, moorings, and cruises. 
              Initially, the PIs propose to characterize the temperature structure over the
              shelf and determine its response to heat flux from the atmosphere as opposed to
              wind stirring and advection.  Then they will address the effects of salinity
              and the variability of the full density field.  NCEP reanalysis products are
              available for the period 1948 to present.  Oceanographic observations extend to
              1900, but most observations post-date 1950.  Air-sea fluxes may need to be
              recalculated to account for significant variability at scales unresolved by the
              NCEP grid.  Bin sizes for analysis will be determined by data coverage. 
              Temporal resolution of interannual comparisons will also be determined by data
              coverage.
