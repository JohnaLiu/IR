Abstract    :
              P.I. Stokes, Malcolm (Scripps Inst. of Oceanography)	Proposal #: 0220400

The
              PIs propose to construct a robust, inexpensive sensor array for use in marine
              and terrestrial environments. This system will utilize a combination of
              standard technologies that will enable easy deployment of densely populated
              sensor arrays, (up to 96 sensors, on 8 cables in a single logging unit) in
              high-energy environments. An important advantage of the proposed network of
              sensors is that it can be built at low cost thus increasing the likelihood that
              this instrumentation will be widely used. Another advantage is that, the
              time-division multiplexing technology developed for the prototype will be
              easily adaptable to other transducers (i.e. salinity, light intensity). A
              prototype array constructed to measure pressure and temperature was deployed
              off Scripps Pier and showed the utility of the design for studies requiring
              high-resolution monitoring of environmental conditions over spatial scales of
              100 to 1000 m.
	This proposal requests funding for the development of two
              autonomous instrument packages based on the prototype technology. These new
              generation arrays will significantly extend the capabilities of the prototype
              by incorporating a more robust cabling scheme; utilizing surface mount
              circuitry for miniaturization of individual sensor modules; and adding an
              autonomous data-logging microcontroller for long-term, underwater deployments.
              One instrument package would include 96 pressure sensors (arranged as 12
              individual transducers on 8 cable elements) and the other would include 96
              precision thermistors. Each microcontroller could be programmed to record data
              from any combination of pressure, temperature, or other environmental sensors
              in a modular fashion. The PIs propose to test the instruments as part of
              currently funded projects that would benefit from higher resolution sampling.
