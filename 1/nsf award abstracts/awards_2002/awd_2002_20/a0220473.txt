Abstract    :
                 Glucocorticoids, such as corticosterone (CORT), are an important group of
              steroid hormones that modulate cellular and behavioral responses to stress. 
              Their action can involve genomic mechanisms in the cell nucleus, and also much
              faster non-genomic actions involving receptors on the cell membrane.  The
              cellular mechanisms mediating responses to acute, as distinct from chronic,
              stress are still not well understood.  Recent evidence suggests that CORT
              interactions with behaviorally important peptide hormones, in particular
              arginine vasotocin (AVT), are critical during acute stress.  This project
              examines how CORT and AVT interact within brain cells in response to acute
              stress, using the salamander as a novel and accessible system to combine
              biochemistry with behavior.  The interactions of the hormones in triggering
              intracellular biochemical signaling pathways will be tested in specific
              contexts, in terms of behavior and neuroendocrine state.  Results will be
              important for understanding fundamental cellular mechanisms of stress hormone
              action in vertebrates.
   The impact will extend beyond neuroendocrinology to
              endocrinology and stress-related behavior, as well as cell biology related to
              signaling.  Valuable training of students at several levels in this productive
              laboratory also will continue to include students with handicaps and those from
              underrepresented groups.
