Abstract    :
              The dynamics associated with blocking events remain unclear and current
              operational predictions have low skill. The PI will study the dynamics of
              anticyclones that exist both at and above the surface over middle and high
              latitudes. Using reanalyses from the National Centers for Environmental
              Prediction (NCEP), the PI and his students will examine the relative importance
              of (1) upper tropospheric cold-air advection in the formation and
              intensification of anticyclones near the earth's surface; (2) deformation in
              the development of blocking, easterly flow around midtropospheric anticyclones;
              and (3) nonquasigeostrophic processes in the development of blocking and
              midtropospheric anticyclones. A climatology of the anticyclones will be
              compiled from NCEP reanalysis and cases chosen for detailed analysis.
              Diagnostics using the quasigeotrophic and nonquasigeostrophic height tendency
              equations will be applied to examine the importance of the suggested processes
              in developing and maintaining these anticyclones. 

Results from this project
              have the potential to increase the understanding of the onset of blocking
              events and increase the forecast skill of them. The research will provide good
              educational opportunities for graduate students.
