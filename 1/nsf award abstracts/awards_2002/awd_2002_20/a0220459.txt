Field measurements of momentum fluxes and velocity profiles
              will be used to help derive a new parameterization of air-sea fluxes under
              multiple roughness scales.  Near-surface turbulence will be measured from an
              air-sea interaction spar buoy (ASIS) at a marine site in the Baltic Sea. 
              Directional wave measurements will be made from ASIS and two waverider buoys.
              Meteorological measurements will be made from a nearby tower.  This site was
              chosen to provide a regime of swell aligned with the wind field, a wide-range
              of atmospheric stability and a low-moderate wind-regime.  The data will be
              analyzed to derive a better relationship between surface roughness and momentum
              flux in swell dominated or mixed sea regions.  Incorporation of the new results
              into state-of-the-are coupled models should lead to improved forecasts of
              hurricanes and tropical storms.
