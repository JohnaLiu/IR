Data analysis and modeling will be used to understand the
              interannual variability of coastal flows, particularly those associated with El
              Nino - Southern Oscillation phenomena, along the west coast of the Americas and
              the South Australian Bight.  The data sets for characterizing this variability
              include many decades of coastal water level data, a decade of altimetry, the
              California Coastal Fisheries Investigation data set, and the Canadian line-P
              data set.  The models to be used will include an improved version of the
              existing Clarke and Van Gorder model, including expected dependence on
              background velocity and sloping stratification, and a statistical model. 
              Existing theory predicts transmission of an equatorial signal along the coast,
              but not propagation of the signal, as observed.  This discrepancy between
              theory and observation will be explored.
