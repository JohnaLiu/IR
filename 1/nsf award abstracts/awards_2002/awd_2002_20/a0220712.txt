Abstract    :
              This project examines the vulnerability of 120 of the nation's largest cities to
              natural hazard events.  The research will identify and integrate within a
              geographical information system, those specific biophysical, social, and built
              environment variables that either increase or decrease vulnerability in cities.
               Three questions drive this research:  1) What underlying factors produce human
              systems (or social) vulnerability and what metrics are most appropriate for
              measuring it? 2) Can we develop a consistent and robust comparative measure
              that allows us to compare the overall vulnerability of one metropolitan area to
              another using hazard, social, and built environment indicators? and 3) Does the
              relative importance of the three key indicators (hazard, social, and built
              environment) change over time and space?

	The project will utilize existing
              hazard and demographic databases as well as those created by the investigator
              through prior NSF-funded research.  For each metropolitan area we will develop
              a series of composite indexes that allow us to paint a picture of the
              vulnerability of the natural, social, and built environment in each city.  The
              availability of historic data enables us to monitor changes in vulnerability
              during the past 40 years (1960-2000).  By using a geographical information
              system, we will be able to map not only the geographic differences in
              vulnerability, but also the historic changes as well.  In this way, we should
              be able to determine which urban areas are the most vulnerable and why.
