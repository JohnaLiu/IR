Abstract    :
              In 1997, Louisiana State University began construction of GULFNET, a geodetic
              system
consisting of continually operating reference stations and episodic
              campaign targets.
Originally built to support high precision measurement of
              subsidence and lateral normal
fault related strain, the system was also
              designed to support geodetic-quality
positioning. This system currently
              consists of four continuously operating stations and 24
episodic campaign
              targets and is supported by contracts with the National Science
Foundation
              (NSF-EAR 9725330) and the Louisiana Board of Regents. The
              continuously
operating stations will soon become certified by the National
              Geodetic Survey (NGS) as
official parts of the Continuously Operating
              Reference System or CORS, that supports the
National Spatial Reference System
              (NSRS). Funds originating from US Army Corps of
Engineers (New Orleans
              District) through this proposed contract will permit the expansion
of GULFNET
              by adding three additional continuously operating sites and the
              infrastructure
to continue operation of the network. This new part of the
              system will come on line in
early 2002 and will provide near complete coverage
              of the Louisiana coast.
