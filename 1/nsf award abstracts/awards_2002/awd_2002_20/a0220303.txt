              ABSTRACT

OCE-0220303

In this project, researchers at the Rosenstiel School
              of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Miami will collaborate
              with colleagues at the Nordic Volcanic Institute in Iceland to investigate the
              crustal  residence time of fluids circulating through hydrothermal systems of
              Iceland, utilizing  isotopic tools developed by the PI for submarine
              hydrothermal systems in mid-ocean  ridges. This will allow the refinement of
              these techniques for further seafloor studies, as  well as afford the
              researchers an opportunity to develop new isotopic techniques for ultimate use
              in  submarine systems. Additionally an in-situ gamma detector will be deployed
              within well  waters to make remote, detailed, time-series measurements of radon
              gas.  Previous work by Icelandic investigators has shown that  radon
              measurements have great potential as an earthquake prediction tool.
