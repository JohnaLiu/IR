Abstract    :
              This program provides scholarships to talented, low-income students enrolled in
              Computer Science, Computer Support Specialist, Engineering, Engineering
              Technology and Mathematics. The program uses existing facilities at BSC to
              recruit high school students and provide them with a host of academic support
              and faculty and peer mentoring to succeed in their education. Efforts are also
              focused on recruiting women and minority students in the program. The
              participating students can earn additional college credits through internships
              and cooperative education experience. The students in the program also have the
              opportunity to do research by participating in internships with industrial and
              government partners. This experience provides an opportunity for them to apply
              their knowledge gained in classes to finding solutions to real world problems.
              Job placement assistance is provided to participants who graduate from the
              program and desire employment in their fields.
