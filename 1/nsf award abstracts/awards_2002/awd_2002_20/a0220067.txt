Abstract    :
              Development of Bolted End Plate Connections for Steel Reinforced Concrete
              Composite Structures


Abstract (press-release format for general public)
              

The most significant lesson learned from the 1994 Northridge earthquake and
              the 1995 Kobe earthquake was the cracking and brittle failure of welded moment
              connections of modern steel buildings. The structural engineering communities
              have since been working on development of improved designs. One possible
              solution for making steel structures more resistant to earthquakes is to
              combine concrete and steel to take the advantages of each material.
              

Professors Xiao and Anderson at the University of Southern California have
              conceived several new details to achieve this. They proposed to use bolted
              steel and concrete composite connections instead of traditional welded
              connection to improve constructability and meanwhile to ensure excellent
              seismic behavior for building structures. In the proposed project, they plan to
              prove their ideas through experimental testing and analysis.
