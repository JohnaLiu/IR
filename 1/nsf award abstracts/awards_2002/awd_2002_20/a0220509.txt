Studies


The objective of the program is to recruit,
              educate, support, and graduate students with financial need who are pursuing
              academic majors in, and subsequently careers related to, computer science, and
              mathematics. The project responds to both institutional priorities and the
              national need for individuals within these disciplines. The program supports 21
              students annually for four years. The program consists of comprehensive
              recruitment and academic support programs, and appropriate career counseling
              programs targeting students majoring in computer science and
              mathematics.

The CSEMS scholars are supported through activities that
              involve students in research, extensive internship program, and aggressive
              career services.
