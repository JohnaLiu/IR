Abstract    :
              The faculty at Texas A&M University - Kingsville developed their CSEMS project
              to increase recruitment, retention and graduation of targeted CSEM majors. Then
              plan includes increasing the number of transfer students from community
              colleges in the CSEM disciplines and increasing retention of CSEMS students to
              75%. Their CSEMS students attend orientation meetings with advisors and career
              service personnel. Their Career Services Office offers internships and
              permanent employment. They have created partnerships and formal articulations
              agreements with community colleges in South Texas to help graduates gain
              employment in the high tech workforce in the area. In addition their faculty is
              heavily involved with student mentoring, guidance, and tutoring support. They
              will also coordinate internships and research opportunities for their students.
