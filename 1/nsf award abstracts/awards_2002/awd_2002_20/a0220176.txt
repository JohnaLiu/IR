Abstract    :
              The main objective of the conference is to create an environment for AMPATH
              participants, potential participants and those with a regional, hemispheric or
              international interest in the project to exchange ideas, form new and solidify
              existing collaborations.

The conference will continue the work of
              identifying the universities and research centers in the AMPATH service area
              who require, or would take advantage of, high-performance connectivity to
              research institutions in the U.S. and worldwide if it were available.  Proposed
              speakers at the conference include researchers that participate in projects
              between collaborators in the U.S., Canada, the AMPATH service area, Europe and
              Asia/Pacific.
