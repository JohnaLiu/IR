Abstract    :
              Automatic Analysis of Spontaneous Facial Expressions
Abstract
The goal of this
              project is to develop computer systems for automatic analysis of spontaneous
              facial expressions, with a focus on the scientific study of the role of facial
              expressions in deception. A state-of-the-art digital video database of
              spontaneous facial expressions will be developed. This database will be
              hand-coded by behavioral scientist experts on facial expressions. This database
              will be used to develop an array of software tools for automatic analysis of
              facial expressions from video sequences. These tools will be developed by
              machine perception scientists in close collaboration with behavioral scientists
              and will be evaluated and refined for application to the scientific study of
              facial expressions.

The machine perception community is in critical need for
              standard video databases to train and evaluate systems for automatic
              recognition of facial expressions. This project will provide one such database
              and thus could potentially accelerate research in this field. Automated
              recognition systems would have a tremendous impact on basic research by making
              facial expression measurement more accessible as a behavioral measure,
              providing data on the dynamics of facial behavior at resolutions that was
              previously unavailable. Such systems would also lay the foundations for
              computers that can understand this critical aspect of human communication.
