Abstract    :
              Oregon Institute of Technology (OIT) draws the majority of its students from a
              large, sparsely populated, rural region of South Central Oregon. This region
              has a significant number of underrepresented, low-income populations who are
              currently not in a position to participate in career opportunities in
              engineering and information technology. This region also suffers from shortage
              of students trained for jobs in engineering and information technology sectors.
              The primary goal of this project is to provide scholarships to low-income
              computer science, computer technology, engineering and engineering technology,
              and mathematics students in the region. The project targets underrepresented
              groups, first-generation students, and persons with disabilities. The project
              awards thirty students per year scholarships worth $3,100. It contains several
              new programs, which help to ensure its success. All CSEMS students are required
              to participate in a new Learning Community program in their first quarter in
              the project. As part of the Learning Community, they are required to take a
              newly developed CSEMS seminar. Furthermore, an intensive September Bridge
              program orients new participants to the college and the program.
