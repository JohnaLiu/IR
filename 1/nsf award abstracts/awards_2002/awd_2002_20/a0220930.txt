This collaborative project between Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution and Scripps Institution of Oceanography will
              demonstrate the feasibility of using an autonomous underwater glider to monitor
              the structure and strength of western boundary currents.  During the first year
              of the proposed work the reliability of the glider will be demonstrated in a
              less severe environment.  During the ensuing years, the complexity and duration
              of the glider missions will be increased as we begin deploying them to make
              transects between the New England continental shelf and Bermuda.  The choice of
              the Gulf Stream as the initial boundary current to be investigated was made for
              obvious logistical reasons. The gliders will provide cross-sections of
              velocity, temperature and salinity between the surface and 1000-1500 m depths
              which will be available in real-time.  These data will be combined to provide
              approximately monthly estimates of the relative and potential vorticity of the
              Gulf Stream and its fluxes of heat and salt. The broader impact of this
              research will be in providing a new autonomous oceanographic instrument
              platform and observational techniques that will, first of all, be applicable to
              all other western boundary current including those believed to be crucial for
              predicting climate variability. Beyond that this instrument will find
              application in coastal zone monitoring for pollution and living resources, for
              military surveillance and as a general tool for oceanographic observation.
