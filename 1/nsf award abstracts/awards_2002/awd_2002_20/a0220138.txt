Abstract    :
              The goal of the proposed research is to develop a multithreaded prototyping
              environment that allows hardware and software experimentation with fine-grain
              and speculative multithread chip multiprocessor (CMP) architectures. This
              environment will allow the analysis of single-chip fine-grain threaded systems
              at full hardware speeds in a much more flexible manner than is possible today
              with software simulation, and will be the first hardware implementation to
              execute speculatively multithreaded applications.  This environment would be
              used to investigate threaded applications much more efficiently and thoroughly
              than any other system existing today. 

The prototyping environment will be
              built without doing any VLSI design. The key idea is that by combining
              ten-year-old microprocessor chips with state-of-the-art FPGA chips it is
              possible to build a single-board multiprocessor prototyping environment that
              provides support for thread level speculation (TLS) and operates at hardware
              speeds, yet has the latency and bandwidth characteristics equivalent to a
              modern CMP architecture. Such an environment will be ideal for architecture and
              software research on multithreaded microprocessors
