      Title: ITR/SY Features, Components, and Legacy
              Systems

               A legacy system is any software system that is in use and must evolve
     
              to meet changing conditions. These systems must be re-engineered
      because
              over time, the ability to evolve the system decreases with
      each
              successive maintenance. The proposed research combines the
      concepts of
              features and software components in a novel way to
      extract feature-based
              software components from a legacy
      system. First, the features of the
              target legacy system are elicited
      and using existing code profiling
              tools, the code associated with
      these features is identified. This task
              is made possible by the
      regression test suite that many legacy systems
              already have to ensure
      proper functioning as the system is upgraded. 
              Second, software
      components are refactored from the legacy system. In
              short, the data
      generated by execution traces is analyzed for evolution
              purposes.
      The research will provides a viable long-term strategy for
              an
      organization to incrementally modernize its software code base. A
  
                 reengineering methodology will be defined and applied. A
     
              corresponding cost/savings model will be developed based upon
     
              preliminary success with the legacy system for a financial
      company. The
              methodology will be packaged and disseminated to ensure
      other
              organizations with legacy systems can easily benefit from the
      results of
              this research.
