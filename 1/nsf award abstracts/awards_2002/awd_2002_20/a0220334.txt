Abstract    :
              The ARM processor, a leading processor design for the embedded domain, supports
              a 32 bit ARM instruc-tion set as well as a 16 bit Thumb instruction set. This
              project is aimed at exploring two approaches for generating code that will
              simultaneously achieve the goals of small code size, low energy consumption,
              and good performance. The frst approach judiciously combines the use of ARM and
              Thumb instructions to generate mixed code either dynamically or at compile
              time. The second approach focusses on changing the data layout in a way that
              compact code can be generated without sacrifcing good performance. To
              thoroughly explore the above approaches an experimental infrastructure based
              upon the Simplescalar simulator and the gcc compiler is being developed.
