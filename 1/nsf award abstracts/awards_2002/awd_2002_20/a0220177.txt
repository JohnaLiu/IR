Abstract    :
              The American Chemical Society METAL OXIDES Symposium on will be held in Boston,
              MA, August 18-22, 2002. The goal of the conference is to facilitate
              multidisciplinary interactions and information exchange within a broad spectrum
              of researchers, to include CAREER  grantees, post doctoral scholars and
              graduate students working in priority areas of the broad field of metal oxide
              solid-state chemistry. The NSF funds will be used to support the costs for
              invited speakers, junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students to
              participate in the symposium. 

The Solid State Chemistry community continues
              to have direct impact on technological areas that are crucial to advancing
              society through the design, synthesis and application new materials. Examples
              include metal oxide materials for oxide ferroelectrics,  thin films for
              electronics and electrooptic devices, oxide superconductors and oxides with
              negative thermal expansion coefficients. Since these technical areas are of
              very high priority to industry,  students educated and trained in these
              multidisciplinary areas involving solid-state chemistry compete very well in
              the job market and go on  to contribute in many significant ways to the global
              economy.
