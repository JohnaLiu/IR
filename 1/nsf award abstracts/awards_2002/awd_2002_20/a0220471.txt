Analysis of existing finestructure and microstructure data will
              be conducted. The data, derived from two recent investigations of ocean mixing
              processes: the Brazil Basin Tracer Release Experiment and the study of
              Circulation in the Romanche Fracture Zone, consist of vertical profile
              observations from the High-Resolution Profiler and moored current meter
              measurements. Several signals in these data will be explored, documented, and
              presented in the scientific literature that address (1) the nature of the
              finescale shear and strain and the associated turbulent dissipation in the
              abyssal ocean above rough bathymetry (at subtropical latitudes and on the
              equator), (2) the flow within a mid-ocean ridge fracture, (3) the intensity and
              spatial distribution of turbulent dissipation in a field of equatorially
              trapped deep jets, and (4) the intensity of the mid-depth internal wave field
              and associated mixing at tropical latitudes away from the immediate vicinity of
              the equator. The projects are related by the common goal of improving
              understanding of mixing and diapycnal transport in the deep ocean.
