Abstract    :
              Web-based services delivered on scalable cluster platforms are playing
an
              increasingly important role in today's society. A key aspect that
has not been
              sufficiently addressed is delivering scalable performance
with quality of
              service guarantees. It is all too common that web
services suffer from outages
              due to unexpected demand.  In the future,
as even more computing devices
              (e.g., Sensor Networks) depend on
services, ensuring scalability, reliability,
              fault-tolerance and
quality of service will become paramount, and will allow
              our society
to function normally. This proposal aims at solving the
              critical
research necessary to achieve this vision.

This project will study
              the problem of resource management for
Internet services on large-scale
              clusters, and develop novel solutions
that address the shortcomings of
              traditional approaches (i.e., poor
resource utilization, high cost, and low
              flexibility).  This work will
develop models that express how clusters share
              the resources, and will
devise metrics that capture the needs of Internet
              services. Performing
extensive simulations using workloads of real web
              services, a variety
of scheduling algorithms and techniques for managing
              resources will be
analyzed. Results from these studies will be applied in
              building an
actual cluster research prototype capable of delivering the
              desired
service guarantees.
