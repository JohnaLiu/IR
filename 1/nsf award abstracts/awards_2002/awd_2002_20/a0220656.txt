Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funds to recruit and retain 29 students from the community
              college transfer population in the Mathematics and statistics department as
              well as the computer science department. It will target the financially needy
              student with special attention being given to the enrollment of women and other
              under represented minorities. The students will come from either community
              college transfers or current junior and senior programs. In the previous CSEMS
              program the university funded 10 talented freshmen to participate in the
              program with the other CSEMS selected scholars. The recruiting program detailed
              here is innovative, careful and well supported by the University.
