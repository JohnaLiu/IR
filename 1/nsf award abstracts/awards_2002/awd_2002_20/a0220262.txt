Abstract    :
              Abstract
The ARM processor, a leading processor design for the embedded domain,
              supports a 32 bit ARM instruction set as well as a 16 bit Thumb instruction
              set. This project is aimed at exploring two approaches for generating code that
              will simultaneously achieve the goals of small code size, low energy
              consumption, and good performance. The first approach judiciously combines the
              use of ARM and Thumb instructions to generate mixed code either dynamically or
              at compile time. The second approach focusses on changing the data and code
              layout in a way that compact code can be generated without sacrifcing good
              performance.  To thoroughly explore the above approaches an experimental
              infrastructure based upon the Simplescalar simulator and the gcc compiler is
              being developed.
