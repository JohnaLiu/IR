              Coding and Pattern Recognition with Hybrid Olfactory

The natural olfactory
              system combines high sensitivity with broadband detection, excellent
              discrimination, and fast response times.  These characteristics are a result of
              the sensor array design and the down-stream neural processing.  In addition to
              being relevant to the development of an artificial nose, the pattern
              recognition problem faced by olfactory systems is analogous in many respects to
              problems in data mining, especially related to DNA micro arrays.  To further
              our understanding of the biological solution to this general problem, it will
              be advantageous to record from multiple olfactory neurons simultaneously.  This
              proposal seeks to develop a novel hybrid-device olfactory biosensor, and then
              to use this system to investigate signal coding and pattern recognition.  This
              will provide information about the coding strategy of the natural system, and
              provide a test case for new approaches to pattern recognition in complex
              signals.
