This CAREER workshop is
              intended to provide outreach to institutions that have not traditionally
              received a large number CAREER awards. The PI has planned a CAREER
              proposal-writing workshop in conjunction with a Southeastern Universities and
              Colleges Coalition for Engineering Education (SUCCEED) Regional Conference to
              be held on March 3, 2002 at the The University of Florida Doubletree Hotel and
              Conference Center in Gainesville, Florida.  It is a general goal of the CAREER
              program to achieve a broader diversity of proposing individuals and
              institutions.  The establishment of regional workshops for young investigators
              is one method of accomplishing this goal. The PI has invited young faculty from
              about 40 schools in the southeastern region.  Institutions in most of the
              southeastern states are invited to send representatives.  Funding will provide
              travel grants for the participants.  This workshop is intended to help young
              PIs become more competitive in receiving initial grants, especially CAREER
              awards.  In addition, the PIs will be invited to stay for the remainder of the
              SUCCEED conference (March 3 - 5), which will focus on educational issues such
              as teaching effectiveness, mentoring, and assessment.
