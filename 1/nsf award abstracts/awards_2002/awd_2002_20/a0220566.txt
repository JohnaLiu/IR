Abstract    :

Using 10 years of data from the Mineral Management Service's
              Santa Barbara Channel-Santa Maria Basin study, the PIs will characterize the
              local internal tide regime.  The major objectives of the proposed study will be
              to identify the structure of tidal band motions in the central California
              region, calculate the energetics associated with the internal tide, and
              identify possible dissipation and mixing sites. Mean annual time series of the
              key internal tide properties will be developed and assessed in terms of the
              annual cycles of the local mean flow and stratification. The influence of
              intermittent events in the mean flow field, stratification and meteorology on
              the internal tide structure will be identified. Aberrations from the mean
              annual cycles corresponding to El Nino and other interannual induced changes in
              meteorology and ocean conditions will be identified. With the information
              generated by this study, it will be possible to quantitatively assess the
              effects of internal tides on water quality and resource management issues in
              the geographical region of study and in similar coastal shelf regions of the
              western United States.
