Abstract    :
              This project provides scholarships for academically talented and financially
              needy students pursuing baccalaureate degrees in math, computer science or
              information systems. The project focuses on recruitment of eligible students
              and builds upon the university's strong academic programs, assists the
              math/computer science department in meeting their goal of increasing majors in
              the department. 

These scholarships enable the scholars to afford a
              high-quality private education, complete their degree, and attain a job with a
              high technology company or be accepted into graduate school. Current effective
              programs, such as faculty academic advising and peer tutoring, are maintained
              and expanded to ensure that the institution's strong graduation and placement
              rates are maintained for the scholars.

Student recruitment is conducted via
              a number of avenues, including the college's Outstanding and Distinguished
              Scholar Days, Science visit day, the college's admissions office, contacts with
              regional high school teachers, and utilizing the college's established Upward
              Bound and Educational Talent Search programs. The scholar's applications are
              reviewed by a team comprised of the PI and representatives from the offices of
              admissions, registrar, and student financial planning. The CSEMS faculty works
              with the university's Department of Career Services to seek out internship
              opportunities for the scholars as well as interviews for job placement.
