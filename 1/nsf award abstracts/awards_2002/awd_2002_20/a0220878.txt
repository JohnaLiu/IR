Abstract    :
              This project annually provides 29 students with a scholarship sufficient to
              cover tuition, fees, and books. In addition, a comprehensive set of academic
              support services are provided to ensure that each recipient attains a 4-year
              degree and is prepared for graduate studies and/or placement in an appropriate
              workplace. Each of the recipients is majoring in mathematics, computer science,
              or engineering, and is either a sophomore, junior, senior, or graduate
              student.

The project provides scholarship recipients with the following
              academic support services: admission and matriculation assistance, workshops,
              access to a study center, advisement and counseling, tutoring, support in
              joining and participating in professional organizations, eligibility to compete
              for additional grant funds reserved for engineering, computer science, and math
              students, support in securing appropriate internships and summer employment,
              professional activities, job placement assistance, and involvement in a social
              support network.
