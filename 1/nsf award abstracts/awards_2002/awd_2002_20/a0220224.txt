Abstract    :
              This small grant for exploratory research supports a geochemistry summer program
              for underrepresented minority students to be based at Colby College.  The goal
              is to expose two high school juniors to the excitement of geoscience research
              while building their formal mathematics, chemistry, and earth science skills. 
              The program is unique from past programs in that the students and their high
              school teacher are all participants in the program.  Students will be selected
              from the High School for Engineering Professions program or the College
              preparatory Magnet program at Scotlandville Magnet High School in Baton Rouge,
              LA.  The students will be part of ongoing research at Colby investigating the
              geochemistry of the Belgrade lakes watershed.  The summer program will be the
              launching point for the students senior-year advanced science courses.  This
              experimental program may serve as a model for other partnerships between under
              resourced high schools and four-year colleges and universities.
