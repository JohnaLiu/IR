Observations suggest there exists a qualitative difference
              between deep ocean turbulence and turbulence in lakes and fjords.  The Black
              Sea may represent an intermediate situation.  A study to characterize the
              turbulence environment in this large sea, which is devoid of strong tidal
              flows, is proposed.  An acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) will be
              implanted on the slope and a Lagrangian float released in the interior of the
              Black Sea to define the context of a series of microstructure measurements. 
              Microstructure probe drops and a depth-cycling conductivity-temperature-depth
              recorder will be deployed around these to:
1) quantify mixing produce by
              internal wave scattering at the slope in an environment where tide
              contamination is absent, 
2) measure and parameterize the diapycnal
              diffusivity in the upper 300 m of the Black Sea, and 
3) determine diapycnal
              diffusivity at the anoxic/oxic interface, when accompanying chemists are taking
              measurements to understand the associated reactions.  (The processes have short
              time scales and appear sensitive to the choice of diapycnal diffusivity in
              models.)  
Some effort will also be made to control for three-dimensional
              effects.  Field work will occur during the energetic winter season.  Synergy
              with EPIC2001, an ongoing field program in the Pacific Ocean, will improve
              understanding of high stratification regions. Seasonal variability will be
              addressed by leaving the ADCP in place and collaborating with Steve Riser, who
              has ONR funding to deploy profiling floats in the Black Sea.
