This Doctoral
              Dissertation Improvement project examines the tactics of two environmental
              social movement organizations-one that uses moderate tactics, and the other
              more radical modes of action.  The goal is to understand these different
              approaches to collective action, and how relationships with government,
              businesses, and other nonprofit association might impact tactical decisions.
              The study has two components-participant observation of two environmental
              groups on Long Island, one using moderate and the other radical tactics. This
              will allow the PI to study how processes of interaction influence tactical
              choice. The second part of the project includes a mail survey of a
              representative sample of environmental groups to gather data on the types of
              relationships they hold.  Findings from the project could potentially
              contribute to our knowledge of how social movement groups come to select
              tactics and the effect of relational ties on group mobilization.
