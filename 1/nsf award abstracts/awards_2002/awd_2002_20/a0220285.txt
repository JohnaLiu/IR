Abstract    :
              This program provides scholarships to talented, low-income students pursuing
              careers in computer science. The goal is to encourage eligible students to
              study CS, and help them find a desirable job upon completion of their Associate
              Degree or transfer to a four-year university to enter in a baccalaureate
              program. Selected participants receive tuition, books and fees paid for by the
              grant. In addition to the financial assistance, they meet with the CS
              Advisor/Mentor on a bi-monthly basis during the semester. This helps monitor
              their progress and assure their success in the program. A series of workshops,
              offered throughout the program, allow students to improve their problem solving
              skills, interviewing skills, job-hunting techniques, and writing a resume.
              Students also receive individualized support and peer mentoring as they move
              through the program.
