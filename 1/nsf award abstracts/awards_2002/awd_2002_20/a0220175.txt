Abstract    :
              This award form the Synthetic Organic Program will support a series of three
              annual "Workshops on Organic Synthesis and Natural Products Chemistry."  These
              workshops have the dual purpose of providing an effective forum for informal
              discussion among young industrial and academic scientists on current research
              in topical areas of  organic synthesis and natural products, and assisting the
              Program staff in identifying emerging areas and researchers.  This process, in
              turn, will aid the Program in long-range planning. The specific goals of the
              workshops include: 1) Providing an environment for the dynamic exchange of
              ideas in organic synthesis and natural products chemistry among a small group
              (about 20) of active young researchers in these fields. 2)  Encouraging an
              attitude of cooperation among individuals working in related areas, and
              thereby, avoiding duplicative efforts. 3)  Stimulating participants to study
              new problems  and methods in synthetic and natural products chemistry. 4) 
              Creating an atmosphere in which the scientific and social interaction among
              participants will be both stimulating and pleasant.
