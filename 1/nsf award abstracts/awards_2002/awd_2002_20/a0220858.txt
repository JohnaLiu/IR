Abstract    :
              This program provides scholarships to talented, low-income students majoring in
              mathematics. Special consideration for scholarships is given to minority and
              underrepresented students who desire to receive an associate degree and
              transfer to a baccalaureate program. Students in the program receive
              individualized support via peer mentoring, academic advising, career
              exploration and advisement, and tutoring. The scholarships, renewable for three
              additional semesters after the initial award, provide for the cost of tuition,
              fees and books for a 12-hour full-time course load. The college has partnered
              with the Texas A&M University System on an articulation agreement that provides
              a collaborative support structure to facilitate seamless transition for the
              student allowing them to complete a four-year degree on the college campus.
