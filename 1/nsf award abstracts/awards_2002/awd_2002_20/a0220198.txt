Abstract    :
              This grant is supported jointly by the Divisions of Materials Research and
              Mathematical Sciences.  The research will focus on interference effects in
              electronic systems driven by strong interactions and extends to nonlinear
              physics.  In particular, problems to be addressed in quantum physics include
              interference effects in p- and d-wave chiral superconductors; magnetotransport
              and quantum Hall effect in organic quasi-one-dimensional conductors; and
              Aharanov-Bohm effect in the quantum Hall regime.  In the area of nonlinear
              physics, problems to be addressed include singularities in moving fronts and
              diffusion driven aggregations; integrable aspects of nonlinear dynamics;
              application of random matrices in problems of analysis.
