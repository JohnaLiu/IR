Abstract    :
              EIA-0220021 Wei-Hsu University of Minnesota-Twin Cities ITR: DREAM-Dynamic
              RE-optimization for Application Migration

This project proposes the design
              and implementation of a common dynamic binary re-optimization system called
              DREAM (Dynamic RE-optimization for Application Migration).  DREAM can be used
              for migrating compatible legacy application binaries such as moving
              applications in Intel 486 code to Pentium IV processors, or moving
              IA-64/Itanium code to IA-64/McKinley processors.  DREAM can also be used to
              improve the performance of migrating incompatible application binaries, such as
              moving applications in Unisys x2200 code to the new IA-64 processors.  In this
              case, a dynamic translator first translates the incompatible binaries into
              native code and stored in a translation cache.  DREAM will focus on speeding up
              the native code stored in the translation cache.  Furthermore, DREAM can be
              used to speed up applications released in intermediate form that may require
              generating native code dynamically for higher execution efficiency.
