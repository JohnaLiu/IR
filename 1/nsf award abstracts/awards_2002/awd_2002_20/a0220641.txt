Abstract    :
              This project outlines a solution to a two-fold problem in Texas. The two-fold
              pieces of 
this problem are: 1) the productivity of the flourishing high
              technology economy in the 
state of Texas is being negatively impacted by the
              severe lack of well-educated 
engineering professionals; and, 2) a
              significantly large human resources, particularly 
minorities living in the
              state, do not participate in the development of the high 
technology industry.
              Consequently, economic prosperity bypasses this group. Therefore, 
what is
              needed is some economically feasible funding source that allows all Texas state
              
residents to gain employment in the high technology industry. Hence, the
              scholarships 
afforded through this grant are assisting in alleviating this
              dual dilemma. The MEET-SWT 
project management plan is providing a system of
              prudent strategies for recruiting, retaining 
and ultimately graduating
              traditionally underrepresented individuals. These graduates enter 
into and to
              become productive members of the Texas high technology workforce. The
              
Department of Technology at SWT is optimistic about the opportunity that this
              scholarship 
program is having in promoting education and career opportunities
              in engineering and 
engineering technology for all Texas state residents.
