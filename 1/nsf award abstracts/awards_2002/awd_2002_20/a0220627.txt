Abstract    :
              A three-day workshop will be conducted to synthesize information and evaluate
              critically important unresolved issues, the means for pursuing those issues and
              the logistics and support needed to improve our understanding of the Arctic
              Ocean sea ice-snowpack-atmosphere interactions. The
              Ocean-Atmosphere-Ice-Interactions (OAII) Scientific Steering Committee, a
              component of the ARCSS science program, endorsed this workshop. A primary goal
              of the workshop is top plan a series of field campaigns, model development
              studies and laboratory studies aimed at understanding air-snow-ice-water
              chemical exchange and how this influences climate. Key scientists in the
              relevant sub-disciplines will be involved and will bring together investigators
              that would not normally interact. Linkages and leverages to the U.S. effort
              will also be identified. The workshop product will be a preliminary research
              plan defining the objectives and logistical needs for field, laboratory and
              modeling work. The meeting will further address the wider ARCSS goals
              pertaining to OAII type research and address the implementation issues in the
              context of the new thematic phase of ARCSS.
