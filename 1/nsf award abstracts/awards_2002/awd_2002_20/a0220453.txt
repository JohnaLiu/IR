Abstract    :
              This program provides scholarships to talented, low-income students majoring in
              computer science, mathematics, engineering, and engineering technology. Special
              consideration for scholarships is given to increase the minorities and women's
              participation in these fields. Through the CSEMS Academy at the college,
              students in the program receive individualized support and peer mentoring, and
              have opportunities to participate in internships with local industries such as
              Verizon and IBM, and with other colleges with which the Bronx Community College
              has an established relationship. The Academy also provides a physical place at
              the college where students can form study groups; receive tutoring and other
              services under the guidance of faculty members. Workshops on interviewing and
              job search and presentations by alumni from high-technology industry are also
              conducted by the CSEMS Academy in order to help students find employment with
              local industries once they complete their program. The transfer office at the
              college assists students who are interested to transfer to four-year schools to
              complete their studies.
