SGER: Rethinking Technology After September
              11
Rosalind Williams, MIT


This SGER award supports a small conference at
              MIT, where a small group of scholars gathered to discuss the implications for
              research, education, and public engagement among historians and social
              scientists in technology studies following the destructive events of September
              11, 2001, and their aftermath.   

Participants discussed the following four
              questions:

1.	What knowledge and perspective do historians and social
              scientists have to offer to scholarly and public understanding of those
              events?

2.	What do those events suggest in the way of new agendas,
              priorities, and
directions for research in these fields?

3.	What do those
              events suggest in the way of new agendas, priorities, and
directions for
              education in these fields?

4.	What do those events suggest in the way of new
              forms of political and social engagement for practitioners and organizations in
              these fields?

The primary outcome of the meeting is several sessions and
              workshops at the 2002 annual meetings of the major scholarly organizations in
              the field: the annual meeting of the Society for the History of Technology
              (SHOT) in October 2002 (Toronto), and the joint meeting of SHOT and the Society
              for the Social Study of Science (4S) in Atlanta in October 2003.  In addtiion,
              a weekly seminar is to be held at MIT,  in conjunction with the Knight Science
              Journalism Program and the new Science Writing degree program at MIT, on
              "Current Events in Science and Technology."  Also the workshop is to be
              highlightedin the newsletter for the Society of the History of Technology and
              newsletters of several other scholarly societies in order to stimulate thinking
              about the subject among as wide an audience as possible.  John Krige, Editor of
              the journal History
and Technology has offered to publish a summary of the
              workshop and any papers
that are produced as a result of our discussions.
