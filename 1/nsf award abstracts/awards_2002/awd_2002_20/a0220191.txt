Abstract    :
              A hallmark of gene regulation in eukaryotes is the central role played by
              multiprotein complexes that bind DNA and recruit additional proteins that
              modulate mRNA transcription. The study of the protein-protein and protein-DNA
              interactions that govern multiprotein complex formation is therefore essential
              to a mechanistic understanding of the complex molecular switches that regulate
              eukaryotic transcription. This laboratory's structural and biochemical studies
              of combinatorial regulation by yeast mating-type and human Hox homeodomain
              proteins have revealed principals for complex formation among homeodomain
              proteins, which are found in all eukaryotes and constitute the second largest
              class of human DNA-binding proteins. Prior work has focused on the
              heterodimerization and DNA-sequence selectivity of the yeast MATa1 and  MATa2
              homeodomain proteins and on comparative structural studies on the human
              HoxB1/Pbx1 homeodomain heterodimer bound to DNA. In addition, the structure was
              determined of a monomeric C-terminal fragment of the Tup1 corepressor that
              interacts with a2. This project builds upon this work, addressing questions of
              co-repressor recruitment, Hox homeodomain specificity and activity, and the
              structure of domains outside the homeodomain that play key roles in
              multimerization and nuclear localization. The crystal structure of the intact
              Tup1-Ssn6 corepressor complex, which is recruited to the DNA by MATa2 and other
              yeast transcription factors, will provide much-needed insights into the overall
              structure of this important yeast transcriptional repressor. In addition to
              revealing the fold of domains required for transcriptional repression and
              showing how the TPR repeats of Ssn6 bind to Tup1, knowing the domain
              organization of the entire 4:1 Tup1/Ssn6 will be key to building up a model of
              the complete a2/a1/Tup1/Ssn6 complex that is assembled upstream of target
              genes. Complementary biochemical studies of histone deacetylase recruitment
              will shed light on how Tup1 recruits selected histone acetylases to a target
              gene, and will provide a basis for the design of future structural studies.
              Since Tup1 and Ssn6-like proteins have been identified in many eukaryotes,
              including man, the findings from the yeast system will have direct implications
              for a general mechanistic understanding of eukaryotic transcriptional
              regulation. The PI's continuing studies of Hox proteins and their partners will
              provide further insights into how these important developmental regulators
              discriminate among potential binding sites in the cell and how they are
              regulated by post-translational modification. The structure determination of a
              Pbx1/Meis1 heterodimer will shed light on an aspect of homeodomain gene
              regulation that has not been previously addressed, namely the important
              regulatory role of domains that lie outside the DNA-binding domain. 

The
              results of these studies will yield fundamental insights into basic mechanisms
              of gene regulation, and in particular into the role played by large protein
              assemblies in regulating eukaryotic transcription. In addition, these projects
              provide outstanding opportunities for the training of graduate students in the
              methods and approaches of structural biology.
