Abstract    :
              This project uses a synergistic approach that involves use of field data,
              numerical simulation, and laboratory simulation to study tornado-induced wind
              loads on man-made or built structures. The primary objective of this project is
              to quantify tornado-induced wind loads on typical structures such as low-rise
              and high-rise buildings, dome-shaped and curved-roof structures, and slender
              chimneys and towers that comprise the majority of our built environment. In
              this project, a laboratory tornado simulator at Iowa State University (ISU) is
              used to realistically produce a variety of tornado-like vortices for testing
              their loading effects on geometrically-scaled models of built structures. Field
              measurement data from the University of Oklahoma's "Doppler on Wheels" studies
              along with the data generated by numerical simulations of tornado vortex winds
              at ISU to extrapolate the field data (available for 50 ft and above) to ground
              level are used to validate the flow field generated by the laboratory tornado
              simulator. This laboratory simulator uses an innovative mechanism that allows
              it to produce a translating tornado-like vortex with different Swirl ratios,
              core diameters and Reynolds numbers suitable for geometrically-scaled model
              testing.
