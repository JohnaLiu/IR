Abstract    :
              Spatiotemporal data appears in many real-life applications (global change,
              surveillance, transportation etc.) Together with regular attributes such data
              contains topological as well as temporal attributes. This combination creates
              novel interesting problems. Moreover, spatiotemporal data is usually presented
              in "streams" which drastically affects the data processing methods. We propose
              general exploratory techniques that will allow the user not only to verify
              specific hyphotheses, but more importantly, to understand the underlying
              process that controls the changes recorded in the spatiotemporal datasets. In
              particular:
1. We will first first address the problem of performing on-line
              analysis on spatiotemporal streams. This part of the project will provide the
              appropriate tools for the major effort of this proposal, i.e., understanding
              patterns of change.
2. We will then address the problem of understanding
              patterns of change in specific spatiotemporal applications, namely: (i)
              epidemiological, (ii) environmental and (iii) surveillance applications. In
              each application we will first define low-level analysis primitives. Such
              primitives are simpler to identify in each application area. We will then use
              combinations of such primitives to describe complex (high-level) patterns of
              change.
