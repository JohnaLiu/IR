Abstract    :
              This project investigates new architectures for domains such as cryptography,
              signal processing, and error correction, where the applications are highly
              parallel. Traditional microprocessor architectures will not efficiently scale
              to exploit the parallelism present in these applications.  Hardware design for
              these applications is too expensive, risky, and inflexible. Reconfigurable
              computing, which attempts to combine programmability with hardware performance,
              has logistical problems that will prevent its widespread adoption.  This
              project will develop and evaluate architectures that combine the portability
              and abstraction of software development with the performance of reconfigurable
              hardware. This will be done by converting a serial representation of an
              application into a spatial representation, and executing the spatial
              representation on a fabric of locally interconnected processing elements. The
              conversion from
serial to spatial representation will be performed at run
              time, concurrently with execution.  

The first phase of this project will
              involve the definition and prototyping of a first generation of this
              architecture. The second phase of the project will refine the code generation
              techniques for
the architecture. The third phase of the project will
              investigate the incorporation of various control-flow operations in the
              architecture.
