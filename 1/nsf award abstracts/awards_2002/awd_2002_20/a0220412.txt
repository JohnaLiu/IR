Abstract    :
              The United States and other industrialized nations in the Organization for
              Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have made large investments in
              information communication technologies (ICT) for schooling and expect these
              investments to advance not only school reform but life-long learning as well. 
              For these aspirations to be realized, policy makers require information on how
              ICT impacts schooling and learning and how ICT might best be used to achieve a
              range of educational goals.  This proposal requests partial financial support
              for an international conference to disseminate results of major research
              efforts of these issues in 23 OECD countries.
