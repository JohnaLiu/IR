Abstract    :
              The faculty at Auburn has requested funds to support 30 scholarships for four
              years, focusing on African Americans and women in eight engineering,
              departments (including computer science), and mathematics. Eighty percent of
              the awards will be for their undergraduates, the balance for graduate students.
              Undergraduates and PhD-level students will receive four-year commitments;
              master's degree students will receive a two-year commitment of support.
