Abstract    :
              The departments of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of
              Wisconsin-Eau Claire have developed a scholarship program called the Excellence
              in Mathematics and Computer Science (EMACS) program. The EMACS scholars will be
              UWEC mathematics and computer science students selected on the basis of
              financial need and academic potential. The project contains academic support in
              the form of faculty and peer mentoring, student/faculty research opportunities,
              capstone experiences and independent study opportunities. These students are
              also provided with solid career counseling that includes preparation for
              graduate school, service learning opportunities, internship opportunities and
              effective employment strategies such as resume writing and interviewing skills.
              This project also contains an excellent sustainability component.
