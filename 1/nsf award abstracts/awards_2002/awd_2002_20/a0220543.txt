Abstract    :
              	This dissertation would investigate marriage market determinants of
              cohabitation and marriage using 1991-1995 data from the National Survey of
              Family Growth.  The analysis uses characteristics of the labor market area
              (LMA), a group of counties defined by commuting patterns that generally
              constitute the spatial boundaries within which most individuals interact.  Sex
              ratios and the economic characteristics of marriageable men in the area are
              expected to influence both cohabitation and marriage rates among never married
              women.
