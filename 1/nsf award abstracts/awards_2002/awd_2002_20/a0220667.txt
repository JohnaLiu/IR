Abstract    :
              The objective of the program is to recruit and retain top students into the
              Industrial & Systems Engineering Department with an emphasis on Information
              Systems Engineering. Scholarships are awarded to students at the undergraduate
              and graduate level who are pursuing degrees in Industrial and Systems
              Engineering and who are concentrating in information systems engineering. The
              scholarships are awarded based on merit and financial need. Recruiting is done
              through a multitude of channels to ensure a high quality pool of candidates.
              The number of scholarship recipients is 6 in the first year, 15 in the second
              year, 24 in the third year, and 30 in the fourth year. 

The scholarship
              program builds on other programs in the College of Engineering including a
              research experiences for undergraduates (REU) program, a Telecommunications
              Institute, and a new degree track in Information Systems. The management plan
              includes mechanisms for tracking students, support activities, and an effective
              evaluation design. The tracking mechanisms are packaged into a system that can
              be used by any institution to measure the retention of engineering students.
