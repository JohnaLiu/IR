Abstract    :
              This project provides thirty scholarships to academically talented financial
              needy sophomore students majoring in electrical, civil and industrial
              engineering. Students are selected based on grade point average and strength of
              essays and recommendation letters. The motivations of the student and career
              goals are also important factors.

The project centers on building a
              community of engineering scholars using faculty mentors and other support
              mechanisms. The engineering Student Work Employment office plays a significant
              role by coordinating efforts with partners in industries and government for
              summer internship opportunities, career placement and seminar development,
              which are designed to enhance career or higher education placement. Faculty
              members in the students' disciplines mentor the scholars throughout the
              duration of the program. The mentorship program is expected to be a major
              component of the project, building students' confidence and enhancing students'
              learning. Professional development is also an important part of the program,
              where students attend professional meetings or professional development
              workshops.
