Abstract    :
              The Student Pipeline-Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology
              (SP-CSMET) Scholarship Program is a student focused, experience-based program.
              The SP-CSMET is used to identify incoming freshmen and sophomores that are
              interested in computer science, engineering, mathematics, and technology. High
              school administrators, the university admissions office, the financial aid
              office and faculty members help identify these students. The SP-CSMET provides
              enrichment experiences in engineering, mathematics, and technology by utilizing
              existing programs and by providing lecture series, workshops, and faculty
              mentoring for the students. The SP-CSMET supports 32 new freshmen the first
              year.

The second year of funding supports all freshmen that meet the
              criteria for their sophomore semester. The scholarship slots that are open the
              second year will be used to support new incoming freshmen students. This
              process will be repeated the third and fourth year of funding. The new SP-CSMET
              Scholarship Program is a feeder (Student Pipeline) to a recent NSF-funded
              Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology (CSMET) Scholarship
              Program, serving juniors and seniors.
