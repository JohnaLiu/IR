              Minority Institution Infrastructure: Planning 

This one-year planning award,
              expanding activities geared to attract and retain minority students, supports
              the development of a project that will position Mercy College, a minority
              serving institution, to expand its capabilities in the Division of Mathematics
              and Computer Science. Faculty members will be hired with experience in human
              communication technology to incorporate cutting edge technological advancements
              into teaching and research activities and to develop multidisciplinary,
              discipline-specific and foundational modules in key areas of the curriculum.
              The modules will provide a foundation for the integration of new technologies.
              The award will also facilitate further development by a planning group
              consisting of faculty members at Mercy, and researchers from the University
              Arizona, University of Colorado-Boulder, and University of Houston-Downtown.
              The project supports on-site faculty training at the University of Colorado's
              Center for Spoken Language Research and the development of a five-year
              infrastructure development proposal to improve faculty and student research
              capability at Mercy. The award will enable Mercy College to initiate and
              continue critical steps towards invigorating and strengthening offerings in the
              computer science and information technology fields
