Abstract    :
              In order to develop Submerged Floating Tunnel (SFT) Technology within the United
              States, a workshop on the topic is planned in conjunction with the North
              American Tunneling 2002 Conference.

SFT's are structurally self-contained
              tunnels, anchored beneath the surface of a deep body of water. In contrast to
              conventional tunnels, SFT's are surrounded by water on all sides. By "floating"
              the tunnels in location, a number of advantages over conventional tunnels can
              be realized. This technology can also provide advantages over surface methods
              (e.g. bridges, ferries) of crossing deep water bodies. The potential locations
              within the U.S. alone that could benefit from development of an SFT are
              numerous.

Other countries have already directed substantial research efforts
              toward specific applications of SFT technology. No similar efforts, however,
              are underway in the U.S. Recognizing the advantages of this new technology, and
              that such tunnels will ultimately be built, it is important for U.S.
              researchers and practitioners to develop comparable expertise. It is also
              important to begin the process of public education, which is the first step in
              generating public support for a new technology such as this. The proposed
              workshop will serve as a necessary and significant step in advancement of this
              new technology. It will serve as the first U.S. forum to facilitate exchange of
              ideas between international experts, the U.S. academic community and other
              professionals.
