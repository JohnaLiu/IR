Abstract    :
              This project provides 30 computer science and engineering scholarships to
              academically talented financial needed students. The amount of each award is
              $3125 annually. The support for the students in this program is leveraged on
              the experiences gained from a previous CSEMS award within the College of
              Engineering, Architecture and Physical Sciences. Student support activities
              include comprehensive faculty mentoring, tutorial programs, and advising and
              counseling. These activities support the educational quality of the course of
              instructions delivered to the students, and they aid in curbing the high
              attrition rate of the computer science and engineering majors.
