Abstract    :
              Tober
This pilot project will allow a young scholar to do preliminary research
              on the topic of how Afghani refugees in Iran access local health care services.
               The problem to be addressed is how adherents to a more conservative branch of
              Islam interact with social services predicated on a more liberal Islamic
              philosophy. The specific focus of the project will be family planning as part
              of a package of health promotion and education. The project will be carried out
              in the city of Isfahan, Iran and in the surrounding countryside, including
              rural/urban and Afghani/Iranian comparisons. Using participant observation,
              semi-structured interviews and collecting demographic data from clinic files,
              the researcher will assess the capability of Islamic philosophy in practice to
              deal with fundamental cultural differences. The work will contribute to an
              increased understanding of Islam as a religion and a cultural value system, and
              will advance our understanding of how refugees in general, from more
              traditional cultures, adapt to novel settings, opportunities and constraints in
              more innovative settings. The broader impacts of this research by a Western
              scholar in Iran are very significant, in making human contacts between
              societies that have been in an adversarial relationship, and in advancing our
              understanding of social life in this part of the world.
