This study will address the dynamics and transport properties of
              self-propagating, baroclinic-eddies in the presence of topography. Eddies of
              Mediterranean origin (Meddies) are examples of these features.  The dynamical
              impact of vortex property transport and propagation of seamount-Meddy
              collisions have been observed buy are poorly understood.  Numerical models will
              be used to examine the following related topics: topographic effects on Meddy
              transport, topographic influences on Meddy propagation, mean flow generation on
              topography by Meddies and consequent feedbacks. These studies are pertinent to
              the question of how to parameterize tracer transport in large-scale models.
