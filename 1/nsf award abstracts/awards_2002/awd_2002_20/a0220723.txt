Abstract    :
              Over a four-year period, this project provides scholarships to 20 economically
              disadvantaged, first-generation students who are pursuing a B.S. in Computer
              Information Science, and an A.S. in Computer Science. Participants are selected
              largely from the rural, and economically distressed area of Vermont.
              Scholarship recipients are full-time undergraduate students who demonstrate
              financial need, academic potential, and a desire to enter the fields of
              Computer Science or Interactive Digital Media. Throughout their participation
              in the CSEMS project, participants have access to a full array of academic
              support services designed to ensure their success. They participate in
              activities geared to preparing them for careers in the CIS or IDM fields. These
              activities include career counseling, upper-class and professional mentors,
              workshops on study skills and time management, brown bag lunch seminars to
              discuss career options, visits to job sites, internships and attendance at
              occasional professional conferences.
