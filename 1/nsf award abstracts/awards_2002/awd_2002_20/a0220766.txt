Abstract    :
              This project (MACSTECH Scholars: Mathematics and Computer Science Technology
              Scholarship Program) allows the Mathematics and Computer Sciences Programs to
              provide 28-45 scholarships each year for four years to financially needy,
              academically talented students. Both programs have been identified as "economic
              development programs" by the Board of Regents because of their strong
              technology emphasis and the critical need for graduates in these areas within
              the state of South Dakota. MACSTECH is designed to strengthen the current
              programs and to provide a foundation for future success.

The project
              contains a comprehensive management plan that incorporates student recruitment
              (particularly to develop a critical mass of students in the Mathematics major
              and to increase underrepresented populations and women in the programs),
              develops multiple mechanisms to improve student retention at various points in
              their degree studies, increases the number of highly qualified double majors in
              Mathematics and Computer Science, and provides an extensive student enrichment
              and support structure.

A strong retention program involving continued
              support for successful scholars fosters the success of those individuals to
              degree completion. This is accomplished through advising, building group
              cohesion, and extensive use of student support services, tutoring, enrichment
              activities and the resources and activities of existing university programs.
