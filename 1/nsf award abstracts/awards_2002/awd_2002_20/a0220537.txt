Abstract    :
              	This dissertation investigates the impact of high-skilled immigration on the
              earnings and employment of high-skilled native U.S. workers.  It uses Census
              PUMS and March CPS data to describe trends in the highly-skilled labor market
              and to analyze the effects of proportion immigrant on earnings and employment
              in those labor markets.  Highly skilled workers are defined primarily as those
              with higher education working in occupations with high average education. 
              Multilevel models are used to estimate the effects of labor market variables on
              the individual employment and earnings outcomes.
