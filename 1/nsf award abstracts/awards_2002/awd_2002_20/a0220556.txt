Abstract    :
              The American Association of University Women (AAUW) Educational Foundation is
              producing a summary of what has been learned from projects funded by NSF and
              the AAUW Educational Foundation from 1993 through 2001.

Both organizations
              have funded research and demonstration projects in education, particularly
              science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education, that increase the
              participation of girls and women, and provide equal access to learning.  The
              research team will summarize what is found in a number of areas, including
              gender differences in math and science skills and performance, differences
              among girls due to ethnicity and race, successful approaches that engage female
              students, factors that influence girls and women to pursue study in these
              fields, critical junctures for female SMET majors in higher education, and
              determinants to persistence at the graduate level. The study will use findings,
              evaluation results and accounts of innovative efforts reported in 175 projects
              funded by NSF and 200 projects funded by AAUW Educational Foundation.

The
              published synthesis of findings and results will be disseminated widely to
              education policy makers, teachers and administrators via AAUW's publishing and
              marketing programs.
