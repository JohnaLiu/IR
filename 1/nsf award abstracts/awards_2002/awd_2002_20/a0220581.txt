Abstract    :
              This is a continuation of the current CSEMS scholarship program for 30
              mathematics and computer science majors at Augsburg College in Minneapolis, MN.
              Our program targets underrepresented groups and non-traditional age students.
              The program includes a mentoring seminar to be held one evening per month,
              internship and career placement at major Twin Cities companies, and the
              opportunity to work on research projects with faculty members.

A selection
              process has been designed for entry into the program with specific criteria
              which applicants must satisfy. Yearly renewal of the scholarship is required of
              each recipient. The recruitment plan includes working with the Fond du Lac
              Tribal and Community College to bring in more Native American students and
              visits to inner city high schools located near the Augsburg campus.

Support
              structures incorporate and augment existing campus programs. The program has
              been designed to be not only a scholarship award but a concerted effort to keep
              these students from falling through the cracks. The emphasis is on mentoring
              from faculty, fellow students, and industry and community representatives with
              ties to the college.
