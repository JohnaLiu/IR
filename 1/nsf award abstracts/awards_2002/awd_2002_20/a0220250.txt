Abstract    :
              This symposium will encourage the participation of researchers from a broad
              range of disciplines, while maintaining a core representation from the areas of
              Dynamics and Controls. Many of the presentations will focus on new emerging
              research areas of key significance. These new areas share in common the fact
              the dynamics and control theory and methods provide the appropriate framework
              for the understanding of the corresponding phenomena, while at the same time
              providing many of the tools necessary for their application to relevant
              technologies. Examples of these opportunities include the areas of systems
              biology, quantum feedback and control, fluid dynamics, and control applications
              in nanotechnology. The importance of these emerging areas in the current
              research agenda in science and technology means that a unique opportunity
              exists to drastically extend the scope and impact of dynamics and control
              methods far beyond their traditional areas of application in engineering.
