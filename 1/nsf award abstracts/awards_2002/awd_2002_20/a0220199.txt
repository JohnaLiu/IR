Abstract    :
              This project allows talented and needy students the opportunity to pursue their
              educational dreams in the field of computer science or information technology
              at Armstrong Atlantic State University. More specially, 28 two-year
              scholarships to undergraduates in computer science, 12 two-year scholarships to
              graduate students in computer science, and ten four-year scholarships to
              undergraduates in information technology would be awarded.

Having a typical
              class size of less than twenty and an in-state cost of $3,969 for tuition, room
              and board, and fees for undergraduates, Armstrong Atlantic offers one of the
              best educational values in computer science or information technology in the
              country. Armstrong Atlantic's student body is 70% female and 30% of the
              students are minorities. Many of these students are unable to remain in school
              due to job pressures, broken homes, and/or lack of financial resources. This
              project would change the lives of 50 individuals by providing scholarships so
              that they can pursue their studies full-time. 

A comprehensive plan is in
              place for recruitment, selection, support, and job placement issues. The
              recruitment plan includes developing brochures, pamphlets, and Web materials;
              advertising on bulletin boards and newspapers; attending college fairs and
              University open houses; and visiting high schools among other things. The
              selection process involves a well-defined set of criteria, a numerical
              evaluation form, student interviews, and selection committee discussion.
              Support for scholars includes community building, student activities, advising,
              mentoring, and tutoring. Job placement involves advising, internships, resume
              preparation, ACM and IEEE discussions, meetings with industry representatives,
              Savannah's Business and Educational Technical Alliance, and discussions with
              Armstrong Atlantic's Director of Career Services among other events.
