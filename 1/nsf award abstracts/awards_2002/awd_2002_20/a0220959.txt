              ABSTRACT

OCE-0220959

Taking advantage of  existing cruise opportunities to
              take place in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific, off  the coast of Mexico, a
              number of field analytical measurements and  laboratory investigations are
              proposed to further research into iron bioavailability and marine iron ligand
              chemistry. Dominant  phytoplankton communities in this region, Prochlorococcus
              and Synechococcus, are to be studied in the context of a layered euphotic zone
              overlying a suboxic zone presenting distinct sub-environments having strong
              chemical gradients in nutrient, trace metal, oxygen and light regimes.
              Activities such as trace metal sampling, on-deck incubations using competitive
              ligand binding voltammetric techniques, deliberate iron amendment and natural
              ligand photochemical decomposition studies will be studied in a mechanistic and
              process study manner. The anticipated outcome of these investigations is
              increased understanding of the biogeochemistry, speciation and cycling of
              dissolved iron, a trace element often thought to be limiting to phytoplankton
              growth, in the ocean.
