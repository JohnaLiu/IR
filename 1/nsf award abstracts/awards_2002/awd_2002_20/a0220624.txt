Abstract    :
              Project Summary

Lamar University Computer Science-Mathematics Scholarship
              Program (CSEMS) serves 24 financially disadvantaged university students to
              assist them with their financial and academic needs over their junior and
              senior years. A combination of factors including a disproportionately large
              number of first-generation college students coming from low-income households
              exacerbates the problems of retention and graduation rates. Fully 62% of
              Lamar's first-time, full-time entering freshmen are first-generation college
              students, and 81.3% of the student body at Lamar University is eligible for
              financial aid.

In an effort to address the problem of low graduation rates
              among low-income student populations in computer science and mathematics,
              Lamar's CSEMS Scholarship program expects to increased rates of
retention,
              graduation, and entry into graduate/professional programs by providing
              essential services to ameliorate academic, economic, and social barriers to the
              completion of a college education. 

In addition, Lamar has developed a
              management system and an evaluation process that includes assessment of the
              project's progress in meeting its goals and objectives, and to serve as a basis
              for future planning.
