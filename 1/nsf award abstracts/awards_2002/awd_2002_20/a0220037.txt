Abstract    :
              Emulsions, or suspensions of droplets of one liquid phase in another, occur in a
              wide variety of  chemical, biological and materials processes.  Some examples
              include liquid-liquid extraction, the flow of blood cells, thermal induced
              phase separation for the  formation  of  microporous  membranes  and  the 
              formation  of  the  immiscible  polymer  blends with superior mechanical,
              thermal and electrical properties.  In these  and many other applications the
              emulsion is processed so that drops can undergo large 
deformations, break-up,
              and coalesce. The proposed project is  an interdisciplinary  collaboration
              concerned  with large-scale micromechanical simulations of low-Reynolds-number
              or Stokesian emulsions.  To deal with numerous challenges associated with this
              class of problems, the project brings together three researchers with expertise
              in geometrical modeling and visualization, fluid mechanical modeling and
              computations, and fast boundary element methods. The principal objectives of
              the project are twofold.  First, explore, develop  and implement various
              tightly integrated computational methods that will significantly advance
              existing computer simulation capabilities for Stokesian emulsions.  Second,
              conduct simulations critical to the better qualitative understanding  of the
              coalescence-induced-coalescence phenomenon and sheared emulsions containing
              highly deformable second-phase droplets capable of coalescence and break-up.
