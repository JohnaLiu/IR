Abstract    :
              The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for the Management
              of Information at the University of Arizona has been an I/UCRC for the past
              five years and will continues to follow the model of the I/UCRC program.  The
              Center's goal is to create knowledge, methodologies, practices and software to
              support individuals, organizations and society in the collaborative use of
              information technology.

Research in the area of collaborative computing is
              an integral part of the development of the office, school and government of the
              future.  Current research centers within the Center include collaborative
              computing, knowledge management, and technology-supported learning.  In the
              past five years, the Center has developed a synergistic partnership between
              university researchers and industry users through its industry relevant
              research and its structure.  Research projects are developed and pursued with
              significant input from the industry partners.
