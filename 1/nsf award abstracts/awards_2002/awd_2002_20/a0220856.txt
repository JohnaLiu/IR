Abstract    :
              Linn-Benton Community College's (LBCC) project expands opportunities for
              education,
increases retention to baccalaureate degree achievement, and
              improves employability of low-income,
academically talented students in
              transfer programs in Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics.
This is
              accomplished by providing targeted academic, career, and other support services
              to the
recipients of 30 scholarship awards each year.
The four main
              components of the LBCC Tech Scholars Program (TSP) are:
oFinancial support
              through TSP scholarships to allow talented low-income students to pursue
              full-time studies in Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics
oAcademic
              support through existing programs and new initiatives to assist students with
              current coursework and prepare them for success in upper division
              coursework
oMentoring and student support to increase retention at LBCC and to
              promote a smooth transition to the transfer institution
oActivities to
              strengthen employability, including career explorations, preparation for
              internships, and development of job-seeking skills

The theme permeating all
              components of this project is 'community building' a focus on establishing
              a
cohort that provides peer support; develops an increased sense of belonging;
              and promotes identification
with the discipline at LBCC, the target transfer
              institution, and the chosen profession. Enhancements to
existing support
              services as well as new initiatives are designed specifically to strengthen
              these bonds and
reduce feelings of isolation. There is a great need in Oregon
              for skilled high tech employees. LBCC is in a prime position to work toward
              meeting that need because of high unemployment in parts of our service
              district, a large percentage of students who have financial need, strong
              community support for this community college, robust transfer programs in
              Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics, and extensive articulation with
              both high schools and transfer institutions.

LBCC initially recruits
              low-income students who are currently enrolled at the college and who
have
              demonstrated academic talent in Computer Science, Engineering, or Mathematics
              into the TSP.
After the first year, the program expands to include low-income
              high school students who have
demonstrated academic talent and expressed an
              interest in majoring in one of these three areas. The
financial support
              provided by the scholarships increases full-time enrollment and improve
              academic
life by reducing the need to work long hours for an income. TSP
              scholars are then able to more fully
utilize the academic, career, and
              personal support services. TSP scholars benefit from extensive academic support
              systems currently available, including free tutoring; Supplemental Instruction;
              and a Learning Center with Math, Science, Writing, Reading, and Study Skills
              assistance. Enhancements and additions included as part of the project include
              the establishment of a Tech Scholar Center (a designated room on campus where
              TSP scholars can hang out, work on their studies together, and get academic
              assistance); expanded connections between TSP scholars and faculty, students,
              and organizations at transfer institutions; site visits and presentations by
              industry representatives; development of job-seeking skills; and increased
              participation in career-enhancing activities such as internships.
