Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to control Adaptive Optics (AO) systems. Features of
              the AO systems will be modeled in the usual control framework to allow existing
              control analysis, design and adaptation methodologies to be applied. New
              methodologies will be developed as needed. This research will examine the use
              of previously developed Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) designs in both open
              loop and closed loop adaptive control 
architectures. The research will also
              determine the important modeling uncertainties of AO systems and apply or
              develop robust stability and performance analyses to AO systems. Finally, the
              research will extend LQG based designs and robustness analyses to
              Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems. This research will use data
              from the Max-Planck Instiut fur Astronomie (MPIA) telescope at Calar Alto,
              Spain, and simulations developed for the European Southern Observatory (ESO)
