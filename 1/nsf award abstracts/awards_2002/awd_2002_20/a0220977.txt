Abstract    :
              This Advanced Training Institute in Social Psychology will offer workshops for
              training social psychologists in the use the Social Relations Model (SRM),
              which is used to study  individual, dyadic, and group phenomena. The SRM is a
              methodological tool for the study of social behavior that holds great promise
              for new understanding of phenomena that have interested social psychologists
              (e.g., interpersonal and inter-group processes) and as a heuristic device that
              directs attention to new phenomena (e.g., dyadic uniqueness in behavior).
              Although the SRM has been used in over 110 published studies, the technical
              details of the model and the software used for estimation are not well known by
              social psychologists. The training institute will provide a venue where social
              psychologists can quickly learn the essentials of social relations modeling
              from a team of expert investigators and instructors. Participants will receive
              training in the theoretical, statistical, and practical application of the
              model in a broad array of research contexts, and will have the opportunity to
              analyze their own data or data provided from the SRM data archive at the
              University of Connecticut. This unique combination of outstanding facilities, a
              highly experienced training staff, and access to the SRM data archive on-site
              offers great potential for dissemination of the SRM methodology to social
              psychologists.
