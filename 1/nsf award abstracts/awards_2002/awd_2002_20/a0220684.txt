Abstract    :
              This program provides scholarships to talented, low-income students pursuing
              careers or transfer associate degrees in computer science, computer information
              systems, engineering, or mathematics. Special consideration for scholarships is
              given to women, ethnic and racial minorities and persons with disabilities.
              Students in the program receive individualized support, peer mentoring, and
              opportunities for field trips and internships with local employers. The
              scholarship recipients are required to take 2-credit Special Topics course in
              Engineering, Mathematic, and Computer Technology, which encourages group
              discussion and interaction, and focuses on problem solving activities. The
              College has well-established transfer agreements with 4-year colleges
              throughout Washington and graduates have many opportunities for high-paying
              employment with local industries. Strong collaboration with the local business
              and industry is a critical component of this program.
