Abstract    :
              This grant permits the continuation of the Technology Leaders Scholarship
              Program
at Youngstown State University. The program makes available $3,125 per
              year over a four-
year period for up to 29 undergraduate and graduate
              students. The relative number of
scholarships to be distributed at each degree
              level is approximately 25% A.S., 60% B.S., and
15% M.S, although flexibility
              is built into the program with a minimum recruitment goal in
each area. The
              scholarships are disbursed to students majoring in computer
              science,
mathematics, and engineering, with the ratio of disbursement
              reflecting the relative population
of students currently in those disciplines.
              Entering students are required to have a minimum
ACT score of 23 or be in the
              top 20% of their academic class. Continuing students are
required to maintain
              at least a 3.0/4.0 GPA. Recruitment efforts are focused on the local 
service
              area of YSU, with particular emphasis placed on recruitment of minority
              populations 
and women. Retention of students through completion of their
              degree is to be achieved 
through careful selection of candidates,
              student/student and student/faculty mentoring, 
tracking, career guidance, and
              selecting programming aimed at keeping each student 
focused and maintaining
              their interest.
