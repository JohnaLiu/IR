              Science, Engineering and Mathematics Scholarship Program


The goal of the
              program is to extend the NSF CSEM scholarship opportunities to beginning
              Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) students while extending the
              opportunities to J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College (JSRCC) students. These
              new scholarships enable undergraduate students in CSEM majors to complete their
              degree programs within the normal time frame and subsequently enter the work
              force in CSEM occupations. The program provides 29 scholarships of $3,125 per
              year per student over four years to students majoring in computer science,
              engineering, and mathematics.

The comprehensive support structure, which has
              undergone minor refinements over the two-year span of the current program, is
              extended to the new scholars. The opportunity to offer CSEMS awards to
              beginning VCU students presents an exciting possibility to the VCU Director of
              Admissions who is committed to using these awards to help recruit more students
              into CSEM disciplines.
