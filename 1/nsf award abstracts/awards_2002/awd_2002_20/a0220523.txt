Description:  This award supports US-India cooperative
              research on the Digital Library Network.  US PI Saifur Rahman of Virginia
              Polytechnic Institution (VPI) & State University will collaborate with Sivaji
              Chakravorti and other faculty at Jadavpur University, Kolkata on developing
              lifelong learning materials for the Digital Library Network for Engineering and
              Technology (DLNET).  The investigators will create protocols and content
              materials for a new portal through which contents can be both posted and
              accessed.  The portal will provide a gateway for educational and research
              materials that are newly created by universities and professional associations
              in various engineering disciplines.  It will also enhance the dissemination of
              new knowledge across disciplinary boundaries.    

Scope:  This activity adds
              an international component to NSF supported research on the National Science,
              Mathematics, Engineering and Technology Education Digital Library.  
It will
              facilitate lifelong learning among engineering faculty, practicing engineers
              and technical professionals, a practice that is gradually becoming a major
              thrust in developed and developing countries alike.  Digital libraries and
              their content development is a major area of investigation, in which experts
              from all over the world and in various fields can contribute to its successful
              culmination.  The faculty at Jadavpur University is experienced in the design
              of web-based materials; the students are well-versed in modern software
              techniques.  The award will support an exchange of visits between Rahman and
              Chakravorti. Jadavpur University will host the US PI's visit to Kolkata.
