The Pan America Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) award on
              inverse problems, organized by Gunther Uhlmann of the University of Washington
              in collaboration with Dr. Raul Manasevich of the Centro de Modelamiento
              Matematico (CMM) in Santiago, Chile, will take place at the CMM from July 22 to
              August 2, 2002. The event will bring together leading experts in the areas of
              partial differential equations, inverse problems and non-linear analysis. The
              proposed activities will consist of intensive mini-courses followed by
              complementary lectures and further discussion.

The interaction between
              partial differential equations, inverse problems and non-linear analysis has
              produced remarkable developments in the last couple of decades. These
              developments have implications for different fields, including geophysics,
              medical imaging, and the non-destructive evaluations of materials. One of the
              main objectives of this PASI is to bring many of these developments to advanced
              graduate students, postdocs and other scientists in the Americas interested in
              these fields and their applications. It is expected that the PASI will bring
              about increased collaboration between United States researchers and researchers
              in the rest of the hemisphere.
