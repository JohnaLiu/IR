This award supports a three-year collaborative research and
              education program between the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS)
              and counterpart centers/laboratories in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and
              Australia.  IMS is an NSF multi-campus Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center between the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the University of
              Michigan-Ann Arbor.  The Center is focused on web-enabled technologies and
              predictive intelligence to enable products and manufacturing systems to achieve
              near-zero-downtime performance.  IMS is developing a Web-enabled Manufacturing,
              Maintenance and Service Education, Training and Research Program in partnership
              with government, industry, and international institutions.  Through the
              international center-to-center projects supported by this award, IMS will
              advance a) a comprehensive, multidisciplinary and highly collaborative research
              agenda, b) a cross-university educational curricula, c) virtual student
              research teams, and d) global educational experiences for American students.  A
              critical element of the program will be the placement of U.S. undergraduate and
              graduate students in internships in the foreign partner laboratories to
              collaborate on research projects that are an integral part of the IMS research
              agenda.
