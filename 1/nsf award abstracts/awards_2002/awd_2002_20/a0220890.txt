A
              novel and unique measurement system will be deployed to obtain measurements of
              oceanic turbulence.  A submersible PIV system will be used during 3 campaigns
              at SABSOON, a coastal observatory in the South Atlantic Bight, to measure
              turbulence and mean flow characteristics in the bottom 10 m of the water column
              and to compare these to stratification, wave climate, and circulation. 
              Reynolds stresses, dissipation, production, transport, and buoyancy flux will
              be related to elevation, mean velocity distribution, shear, stratification,
              Richardson number, and wave phase.  When and where a local balance between
              production, dissipation, and buoyancy flux holds will be explored.  The
              correlation, or lack thereof, between turbulent and wave stresses will be
              investigated.  The origin of gusts will be characterized.  In the context of
              Large Eddy Simulation (LES) modeling, subgrid scale (SGS) turbulent stresses
              will be compared to typical parameterizations.  Wave-turbulence separation will
              be performed using a version of the Trowbridge technique.
