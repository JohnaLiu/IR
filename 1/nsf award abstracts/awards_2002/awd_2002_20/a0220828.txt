Abstract    :
              This project provides 40 scholarships per year to first or second year computer
              science and mathematics majors who are financially needy and academically
              talented. The program aggressively advertises from underrepresented groups,
              including women, racial and ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities.
              Current university programs are used to provide additional academic support,
              which include study skills training, tutoring, and professional mentoring. The
              program also includes interviewing skills, peer support, and professional
              mentoring through internships and industry contacts.
