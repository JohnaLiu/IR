              0220554 Abstract Christian Wagner
The objective of this faculty's work from
              Oakland University is to increase the number of college students entering the
              high technology workforce in computer science, engineering, mathematics, and
              statistics. Their efforts involve contact with the area high schools and the
              city administration of Detroit. Their plan is to give special consideration to
              students in the Automotive 2020 program. Their efforts focus on the Detroit
              Public system. There are crucial curriculum modifications at Oakland University
              designed to support the students in this plan. All the students in this program
              will have a required interdisciplinary course focusing on professionalism and
              ethics in technology. A student completing his/her program in 4 years instead
              of 5 or 6 is a goal of the plan. Finally their student population is involved
              with summer internships with local industries on various research projects.
              Oakland University has partnerships with a number of universities. These are
              University of South Carolina, Anna University (India), Hanover University
              (Germany) and Cariff University (Wales). Oakland University has partnerships
              with a list of technology and industrial firms.
