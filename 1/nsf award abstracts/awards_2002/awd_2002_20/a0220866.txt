Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this project is to address three transition points critical
              to increasing the number of CSEMS students qualified and prepared to enter the
              high technology workforce. These three transition points present barriers that
              impact the recruitment and retention of incoming freshmen, rising juniors, and
              community college transfers. The project plan strengthens existing efforts and
              renews collaborations among the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied
              Science faculty, the Center for Excellence in Engineering and Diversity,
              industry, and alumni in an effort to effectively develop, graduate, and place
              CSEM students into career positions or graduate school. At the end of this
              multi- phased, four-year project the governance team expects to positively
              impact 80 economically disadvantaged and underrepresented engineering, computer
              science and mathematics students.

Along with new recruitment programs, the
              CSEMS Project team includes faculty in key retention and student support
              components and institutionalizes promising pilot programs. The UCLA CSEMS
              Project team includes four faculty members and the Director for the Center for
              Excellence in Engineering and Diversity.
