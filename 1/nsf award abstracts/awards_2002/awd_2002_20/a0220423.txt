              Abstract

This project at LaSalle University  awards a total of thirty (30)
              scholarships to low income, academically talented students, including twenty
              (20) undergraduate students and ten (10) graduate students over a 4-year
              period.

The target audience includes 30% women, and 10% minorities. A
              special effort is made to recruit additional women, particularly into the
              undergraduate Computer Science and Information Technology majors. The PI works
              with designated staff in the Admissions Office to increase the number of
              minority students majoring in MTH/CSC/IT by seeking transfer students from
              Community College of Philadelphia and from LaSalle's Bilingual Undergraduate
              Studies for Career Advancement Program, an innovative associate degree program
              for Latino students.

In addition to scholarship assistance for the student
              recipients, NSF funds are also used for project management and for a special
              Career Exploration series of guest speakers who are employed in these fields.
              The University provides funds from its annual budget to the Mathematics and
              Computer Science Department for tutorial assistance for the undergraduate CSEMS
              recipients.

80% of the funded students are expected to receive their degrees
              within four years of matriculating at La Salle, and 80% are expected to attain
              new or advanced professional positions related to their field of study within
              one year of graduation.
