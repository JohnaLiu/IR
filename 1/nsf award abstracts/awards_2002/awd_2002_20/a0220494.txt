Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support of a workshop in the area of ultra-fast,
              ultra-intense laser science being held in Washington, DC, 17-19 June, 2002.  
              Ultra-intense laser science is an area that holds exciting prospects for
              advances in physics, and the workshop will provide a means of assessing the
              current and future technical and scientific opportunities in this field.
