Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed work is to develop a unified framework
for
              synthesis and control of infinite-state reactive systems based on
temporal
              specifications.  With synthesis, the full program is
generated directly from
              its specification. With control, part of the
system is given and the task is
              to generate the modules interacting
with the given components such that the
              overall system satisfies its
specification.  The framework will include a
              computational model to
represent the notions of infinite games, control,
              realizability, and
synthesis of reactive systems, a specification language
              that can
assign goals (winning conditions) to sets of system components,
              and
deductive-algorithmic methods to solve the synthesis and control
problems
              in their various forms for the infinite-state case.

The starting point for
              this framework will be a theoretical foundation
built on the models and
              methods developed for algorithmic synthesis
and control of finite-state
              reactive systems. These methods will be
combined with methods developed for
              deductive verification and
abstract interpretation of reactive systems, and
              with deductive
synthesis techniques for functional programs to allow the
              synthesis
and control of infinite-state systems. Preliminary investigations
              into
this approach, described in this proposal and also accepted
              for
publication, are promising.
