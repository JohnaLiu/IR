Title:
Practical and Performance Oriented Nonlinear
              Adaptive Robust Control -- Theory and Applications to Precision Control of
              Modern Mechanical Systems

Abstract: 

The goals of this project are to (i)
              develop a general framework for the design of practical and performance
              oriented nonlinear adaptive robust controllers (PARC) that explicitly take into
              account the effects of typical implementation constraints while without
              sacrificing achievable implementation performance much and being structurally
              simple to facilitate design and implementation, (ii) determine practically
              meaningful criteria and appropriate optimization algorithms that can be used to
              systematically determine PARC parameters for an optimized control performance,
              and (iii) apply the integrated PARC design to the precision control of
              high-speed mechanical systems driven by either electro-magnetic motors or
              electro-hydraulic actuators as well as the coordinated control of high-speed
              robot manipulators. A fundamentally different new design philosophy on
              synthesizing nonlinear robust feedback is adopted to solve the structural
              complexity of existing adaptive robust controllers-proper nonlinear robust
              feedback with fixed structures is used so that the effects of typical
              implementation constraints such as the control input saturation, measurement
              noise, and neglected high frequency dynamics can be explicitly analyzed and
              quantified through a combination of global nonlinear synthesis and local
              quasi-linear analysis. The research emphasizes both general theory development
              and the integration of the proposed PARC with the particular characteristics of
              the application. The education plan focuses on the in-depth re-examination of
              current undergraduate and graduate control curriculum to set the right control
              design philosophy for students during their early stage of control education,
              as well as developing innovative course on performance-oriented nonlinear
              adaptive and robust controls. The proposed research is motivated by the lack of
              advanced and yet practical performance-oriented nonlinear adaptive robust
              control designs that are needed in engineering control curriculum to meet
              industry needs for high productivity and quality products. Once successfully
              completed, the results will have a lasting impact on future control curriculum,
              at both the undergraduate and the graduate level. The results also have a
              direct impact on industry as they directly address the common concerns of
              practicing engineers in applying advanced nonlinear controls.
