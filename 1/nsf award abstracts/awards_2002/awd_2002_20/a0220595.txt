              Project Abstract

The Academic Involvement For Professional Success (AIPS)
              Program targets needy students, many of whom are first-generation college
              students, at Adams State College (ASC), a small rural public institution in the
              San Luis Valley of Southern Colorado.

Scholarship money helps qualified
              students become role models for the other students in the pre-engineering,
              mathematics, and computer science areas. Fifteen (15) scholarships are awarded
              in year one, increasing to 20 for years 2 through 4 of this project. These
              selected scholars are encouraged to participate in departmental and campus-wide
              activities that not only expose them to opportunities designed to heighten
              their academic experience, but that increase their chances and desire to
              succeed as professionals. 

The involvement of the AIPS students in these
              programs also provides a critical mass of students, giving non-scholarship
              students within the mathematics, Computer Science and Physics Department at ASC
              the same opportunities for development and encouragement.
