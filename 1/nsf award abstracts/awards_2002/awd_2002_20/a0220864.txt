Abstract    :
              The goal of UW-CSEMS is to recruit more high school students to computer
              science, engineering, and mathematics careers, and specifically those students
              with demonstrated financial need. Since it is well documented that women and
              ethnic minority students are particularly underrepresented in technical fields,
              these populations are being expressly recruited for UW-CSEMS. In addition,
              UW-CSEMS includes initiatives to retain these students in computer science,
              engineering, and mathematics once they enroll. The UW-CSEMS support program
              involves entering freshmen in a community-building model. UW-CSEMS recipients
              participate in a biweekly seminar the first year they hold their scholarship.
              The seminar includes presentations on academic success skills (such as time
              management and study skills), career options, and research/internship
              opportunities. These students are also encouraged to take advantage of
              on-campus programs in subsequent years such as career guidance, undergraduate
              research opportunities, and industry internships facilitated through the Career
              Fair. Each UW-CSEMS student is assigned a Peer Mentor and a Faculty Mentor.
              These triads meet biweekly to assist in the student's transition to the
              university. A total of 115 students in computer science, engineering, and
              mathematics are being supported with $3000 scholarships (25 in year 1, and 30
              each in years 2, 3, and 4). A management team of faculty from the three
              disciplines and a representative from Student Affairs assist in recruiting and
              selecting the scholarship recipients. Students are recruited using resources
              from the Office of Admissions, Multicultural Affairs Office, and a network of
              over 3000 natural science teachers.
