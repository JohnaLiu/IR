TITLE:
              Development of an integrated computational and experimental approach to predict
              biological networks in Halobacterium sp.

The extremely halophilic archaeon
              Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, whose sequenced genome contains 2,630 genes, is being
              used as a model for predicting biological networks in microbial systems.  The
              genes are compared across species to identify putative protein interactions by
              integrating identified protein/protein interactions from orthologous proteins,
              domain gene fusions, gene localization, and mRNA and protein expression data
              using both existing and new algorithms.  The functional biomodules are being
              determined by integrating this information with additional information from
              biochemical pathways, shared promoter motifs, and a new protein distance
              algorithm.  These approaches are then  integrated into a visualization and
              integration platform, Cytoscape, being developed at the Institute for Systems
              Biology (ISB).
