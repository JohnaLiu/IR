Abstract    :
              Simulation and visualization technologies that have become fundamental to
              contemporary science, engineering, design, and medicine have made possible new
              ways of seeing and knowing and thereby can change the way practitioners think. 
              This project will explore these processes as they are experienced by scientific
              and engineering professionals and the ways in which these new technologies
              reconfigure their professional identities.  Five professional fields in which
              practitioners use simulation and visualization technologies will be examined: 
              archaeologists working telerobotically in deep water; weapons scientists
              running simulations; neuroscientists imaging the brain; physical chemists
              analyzing nanoparticles with atomic force microscopy; and architects building
              in the virtual world.  The methods include field interviews, oral histories,
              and workshops.  Fundamental questions, approaches and techniques will be
              developed for further research and teaching.  It is also expected that
              professional practice will be illuminated in a way that is helpful to
              researchers and designers in the development of ever more appropriate
              technologies.
