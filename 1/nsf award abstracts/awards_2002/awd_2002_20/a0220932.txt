Abstract    :
              SIOSEIS is a software package used for enhancing and manipulating marine seismic
              reflection and refraction data on UNIX computers.  As with all software,
              SIOSEIS must be enhanced and maintained as advances in computer technology and
              seismic imaging are made.
