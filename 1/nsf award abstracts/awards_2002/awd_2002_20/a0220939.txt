Abstract    :
              Jeff Roberts of the University of Minnesota is supported by the Special Projects
              Office to organize a workshop for the RSEC (Research Sites for Educators in
              Chemistry) program.  He is assisted by the PIs of the other for RSECs, who are
              Kelsey Cook (University of Tennessee), Tom McCarthy (University of
              Massachusetts - Amherst), and Paul Rillema (Wichita State University).  This
              workshop will be held at NSF headquarters on 10-12 March, 2002 and will involve
              up to fifty participants.  These participants include representatives from the
              existing RSECs, potential PIs for new RSEC proposals, resource people, and NSF
              personnel.  The workshop has two interrelated goals, information exchange and
              assessment. The format for the workshop includes breakout sessions.  A written
              report is to be drafted based on discussion in general and breakout sessions.
