Abstract    :
              Through collaboration between UCSD's Jacobs School of Engineering, Mathematics
              Department, San Diego Supercomputer Center, and Division of Student Affairs,
              this institution will refine and continue its CSEMS Program in order to provide
              scholarships for freshmen and upper-division, low-income undergraduates
              majoring in computer science, engineering, or mathematics. Ten qualifying
              freshmen will receive $3,030 annually over four years beginning in fall, 2003
              while 40 upper-division students will receive $3,030 annually for two years, 20
              effective in fall, 2003 and 20 in fall, 2005. Recruiting will be initiated
              through personalized letters sent from PIs to students identified as
              potentially eligible. To encourage applications from low-income women,
              underrepresented students and those with disabilities, notices will be posted
              in specialized campus locations such as the Women's and Cross-cultural Centers.
              Applications will undergo review by a committee including PIs and the CSEMS
              Coordinator. Due to under representation of ethnic minorities, women and
              persons with disabilities in CSEMS fields, priority will be given to students
              from these groups. Alternate Scholars will be identified to insure a consistent
              participant level of 30.
