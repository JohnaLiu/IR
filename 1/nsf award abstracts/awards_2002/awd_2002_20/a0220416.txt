Abstract    :
              This program provides scholarships to talented, low-income students enrolled in
              Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics. The project brings faculty from
              the three campuses of Miami-Dade Community College together to help implement
              the program. Over a two-year period M-DCC seeks to award a total of forty
              scholarships to these students. Besides the financial eligibility, the
              scholarships recipients must also meet established academic criteria that will
              enable them to obtain Associate in Arts degrees in computer science,
              mathematics, and engineering. The students have the opportunity to get involved
              in summer internships with local industries. Upon completion of the program,
              the students may continue on to an upper division school or those who receive
              training, may directly enter into the workforce. Faculty Mentors are assigned
              to each scholarship recipient in order to improve the quality of their
              educational experience and thereby improve the student's chances for academic
              success.
