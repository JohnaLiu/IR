Abstract    :
              This project will utilize Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the
              interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetosphere to study the
              dynamics by which the system changes from its normal condition to the magnetic
              storm condition and then back to the normal state.  Previously it was thought
              that magnetic storms were characterized by a rapid series of magnetic
              substorms, but that the basic configuration of the magnetosphere and its
              current systems remained the same.  More recent studies have suggested that the
              storm-time morphology of the electrical current systems in the magnetosphere
              may be quite different from the usual configuration.  In addition to MHD
              simulations, the project will utilize data from a variety of satellites that
              cross the magnetopause at high latitudes.  The project will also utilize
              measurements of the cross polar cap potential obtained from the DMSP satellites
              and other ground-based data, to determine if the polar cap potential drop shows
              the saturation effect that is predicted by the model to be investigated here.
