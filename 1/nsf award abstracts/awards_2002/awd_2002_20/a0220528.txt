Abstract    :
              The class of planar domains which satisfy an exact 
Gaussian quadrature for all
              integrable harmonic functions
was introduced 30 years ago by D.Aharonov and
              H.S.Shapiro.
These rather rigid sets, with real alegbraic boundary,
turned
              out to be essential objects of investigation in a
variety of problems related
              to conformal mapping, fluid
mechanics, approximation theory, potential theory,
              image
processing and operator theory. Top experts in these areas
will attend
              the conference and will discuss the future
directions of research in this
              broad area.

The conference will be devoted to a class of planar
              shapes,
called quadrature domains, which are finitely determined by
indirect
              measurements. They turn out to be important for
applications ranging from 
              inverse problems of geophysics
and fluid flows to tomography. The meeting will
              be a unique
opportunity for young researchers to meet experts in all
adjacent
              areas and to share ideas and information about
quadrature domains.
