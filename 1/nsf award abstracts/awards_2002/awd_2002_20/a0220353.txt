This project provides 20 scholarships per year to economically
              disadvantaged students who major in avionics technology or related engineering
              technology programs. Incoming freshmen pursuing an associate's in applied
              science degree in avionics technology or related engineering technology
              programs, and college students who have already completed 64 credits toward a
              bachelor's of science in avionics technology or related engineering technology
              programs, are eligible to compete for the scholarships. Admission into the
              program is based on the following criteria: grade point average, class
              standing, recommendations, Scholastic Aptitude Test scores and an interview.
              The College provides support for the CSEMS recipients in their pursuit of a
              degree in engineering technology. There are programs such as faculty mentoring
              and a technology seminar series devised to assist the recipients to achieve
              academic success. In addition, the College sponsors many activities such as
              faculty/recipient socials, which reinforce the objectives the College hopes to
              accomplish through CSEMS. Finally, the College provides the recipients many
              opportunities to interact with industry representatives, both on and off
              campus, through internships, job fairs and industry- recipient luncheons.
