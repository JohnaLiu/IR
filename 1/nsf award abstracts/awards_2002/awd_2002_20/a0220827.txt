Abstract    :
              This project is increasing the pool of well-trained plastics technicians in
              eastern North Carolina by implementing a program at six community colleges that
              is improving educational opportunities for economically disadvantaged students,
              increasing retention of students transitioning from high school to the Plastics
              Engineering Technology (PET) associate degree level, and improving student
              services programs designed to recruit and assist PET students in the six county
              area. By involving plastics industry personnel and services, this project is
              also strengthening the partnerships of the consortium and helping to stimulate
              the depressed economy of the region. This project assists the Eastern North
              Carolina Plastics Technology Consortium, or ENCPTC (NSF grant DUE 0101468), in
              its efforts to provide well-trained plastics technicians.

To achieve the
              above goals, the specific objective of this project is to expand, refine, and
              refocus recruitment efforts to develop a target pool of 350 "interested" high
              school students; from which, 20% or 70 students are being selected to receive
              student support services, including financial assistance. This population of 70
              economically disadvantaged or under-represented first year students are being
              provided student services and economic support in order to maintain an 80%
              retention rate for second year students. Ultimately, a 90% employment rate (in
              plastics technology) of all program completers will be achieved.

The PETS
              Project Director, (who also serves as ENCPTC Site Director) and the
              Recruiter/Mentor work with the Financial Aid Directors of the six colleges to
              provide approximately 295 students with scholarships or stipends over a 4-year
              grant period. This program enables students to progressively increase their
              amount of assistance as they prove their potential and reach certain
              milestones.
