Abstract    :
              This project, which is a collaborative effort between the University
              of
California at Riverside and Los Angeles, focuses on processor and
system
              architecture issues for Web Switches.  Web switches are network
processing
              elements that modify network traffic based on content.
These devices are
              frequently used to provide load balancing between
functionally equivalent
              servers as well as cryptographic services; in
in the future will be used for a
              host of new applications including
active security and multimedia
              trans-coding.  This project will begin
by developing a benchmarking framework
              that can be used to evaluate
the performance of Web switches.  The research
              will then use advanced
processor simulation tools to study architectural
              tradeoffs in the
face of the benchmark workload.  In particular, the
              researchers will
focus on the efficacy of hardware accelerator blocks that
              have been
proposed.  Finally, work will be completed to implement the
              workload
and capitalize on acquired knowledge in the context of an
              existing
test bed for network processors.
