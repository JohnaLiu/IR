This Pan American Advanced Studies Institute (PASI) award on
              Materials for Energy Conversion and Environmental Protection, jointly supported
              by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE), is
              being organized by Dr. R. P. H. Chang of Northwestern University in
              collaboration with
Dr. Guillermo Solorzano of the Catholic University of Rio
              de Janeiro.  The proposed PASI will take place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil during
              the first week of September 2003. Experts in fields of energy conservation,
              energy storage and environmental remediation will present lectures and engage
              students in discussion sessions.  Lecturers will discuss new materials and
              processes for fuel cell design and applications, new catalytic materials for
              hydrogen gas generation, and the use of carbon and metallic materials for
              hydrogen storage.  Another part of the PASI will be devoted to the study of
              environmental protection and emissions reduction for a range of pollutants.
              Students participating in this PASI will develop a collaborative research plan
              and gain an understanding of the latest research related to energy
              conservation.
