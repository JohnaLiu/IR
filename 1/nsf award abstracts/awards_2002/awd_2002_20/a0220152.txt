Abstract    :
              Hardware-based approaches to accelerate CPU intensive operations that
arise in
              the context of non-standard database applications are
proposed.  Two hardware
              technologies, namely, off-the-shelf graphics
cards and content addressable
              memories (CAM) that are used in
contemporary Network Routers for very fast
              lookups are identified.
The graphics functionality designed primarily for
              display applications
can be exploited for polygon intersection in spatial
              databases and for
distance-based query processing. Content addressable
              memories (CAM)
can be gainfully deployed for accelerating join operations
              in
databases. In the context of new database applications, the
              join
constraint which is generally based on equality is being expanded
              to
encompass other conditions such as set-containment.  The major goal
              of
this research is to develop a general framework for enabling
fine-grained
              hardware acceleration within a commercial DBM
