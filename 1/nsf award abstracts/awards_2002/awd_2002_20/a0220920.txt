Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for an interdisciplinary workshop to bring
              biologists, geologists, glaciologists and paleoclimatologists together to
              discuss the various scientific studies that could benefit from the development
              of a new, fast and mobile drilling technology for accessing the base of the
              polar ice sheets.  Some of the scientific applications which have been
              mentioned which would be made possible by such technology include opening of
              access to subglacial lakes, detection of life in ancient ice, borehole
              paleothermometry, site selection for deep ice cores, logging of climate proxies
              with geophysical tools, ice rheology studies, investigation of basal conditions
              and their control on basal sliding, sampling of subglacial geology and
              geothermal heat flow measurements.  This workshop will provide a forum for
              discussions with experts in ice drilling, conventional drilling and downhole
              sampling systems and will lead to the formulation recommendations to NSF for
              future directions in rapid access drilling technology.  This workshop will
              contribute to research on sub-glacial lakes in Antarctica, such as Lake Vostok.
              Prior to the initiation of a research program to study the interrelationship
              among geologic history, glaciology and biology in sub-glacial lakes, it is
              necessary to make progress on sampling, measurement and contamination control
              technologies so that the Lake can be sampled in order to maintain sample
              integrity in an environmentally sound manner. This workshop will contribute to
              technology development that will have application to the study of subglacial
              lakes.
