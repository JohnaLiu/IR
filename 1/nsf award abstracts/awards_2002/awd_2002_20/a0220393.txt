Abstract    :
              Many biotechnology applications related to secreted proteins have relied almost
              exclusively on the sec pathway mode of protein transport. However, many
              recombinant proteins are incompatible with secretion via the sec pathway for
              various reasons.  The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes research to overcome
              the limitations of secretory protein expression in bacteria by capitalizing on
              the remarkable properties of the Tat secretion pathway.  The PI proposes to
              exploit the unique features of the Tat pathway to overcome the limitations
              associated with secretory protein production and to develop completely new
              technology platforms for combinatorial protein screening and analysis.  It is
              proposed to:  (1) develop a useful technology for the high level expression of
              secretory proteins via the Tat pathway, specifically the PI will:  (i) employ
              genetic means to identify leader peptides that maximize the flux of proteins
              exported though the Tat pathway;  (ii) utilize cell engineering methods to
              further optimize protein secretion and (iii) examine in detail the effect of
              growth conditions on secretory protein production, (2) develop methods for the
              display of protein libraries by utilizing the Tat pathway and then investigate
              the hypothesis that altering the pathway of protein secretion will result in
              the isolation of additional and/or novel proteins capable of performing a
              desired function,  and (3) develop a new technology for the detection of
              protein-protein interactions analogous to the yeast two-hybrid system by
              exploiting the Tat pathway.
