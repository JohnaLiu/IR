Abstract    :
              This project awards 24 four-year scholarships to incoming full-time freshman in
              the Class of 2007 who demonstrate financial need, show academic promise, and
              declare intent to major in one of the eligible disciplines when entering the
              College.

A Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship
              (CSEMS) Committee was established to work with Admissions and Financial Aid
              staff during the recruitment and application period. The Committee helped
              recruit candidates locally with a special emphasis upon increasing diversity in
              these majors. The Committee monitors student performance throughout the program
              to ensure academic success and continued eligibility.

Students are assigned
              an advisor in their chosen disciplines who closely monitors their performance.
              Other support services available to students include tutoring, mentoring, and
              internship opportunities. Scholars receive a rigorous education in the major
              field of study as well as a strong grounding in the liberal arts.
