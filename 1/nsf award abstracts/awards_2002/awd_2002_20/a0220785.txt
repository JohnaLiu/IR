Abstract    :
              This scholarship project provides funds for 30 computer science and information
              system (CSIS) students at Kennesaw State University (KSU). The amount of each
              award is $3000.00 annually. The support for the students in this program is
              leveraged on the experiences gained from existing programs within the
              Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, for example, a summer program
              for high achieving underrepresented high school students from the local area of
              KSU. This program is called the Cybertech 2k. There are two existing and
              significant support and complementary programs to the CSEMS project at KSU: 1)
              Yamacrew program which is a Georgia economic development initiative intended to
              make Georgia a world leader in the design of broadband communications systems,
              devices and chips; and 2) Mentor-Protege program which was established to
              incorporate undergraduate research into the fabric of the College of Science
              and Mathematics degree programs. These programs support the educational quality
              of the course of instructions delivered to the students, and they aid in
              curbing the high attrition rate of the CSIS majors.
