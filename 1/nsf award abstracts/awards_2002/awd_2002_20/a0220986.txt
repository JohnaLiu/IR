The purpose of this SGER award is to assess the
              potential for using the * 18 O values of carbonates deposited on the Bolivian
              Altiplano as a paleoaltimeter. The * 18 O paleoaltimetric technique relies on
              an understanding of the changes in the * 18 O values of meteoric water vs.
              altitude in the region of study and has been used successfully in the Himalaya.
              The PI's would like to extend the use of this technique to the diverse climatic
              regimes across the Bolivian Andes and Altiplano. Additionally, a cosmogenic
              paleoaltimeter is theoretically feasible, and this project seeks the funds to
              the lay the groundwork for development of a new geologic paleoaltimeter. If
              successful, the information gained by this project will allow an independent
              calculation of paleoelevation that can be compared with existing
              paleobotanical, geomorphologic, and structural estimates. The exploratory
              nature of this project and the potential impacts of 1) quantitatively
              calculating Altiplano paleoelevation and 2) assessing a new paleoaltimetric
              technique makes this work highly appropriate for SGER funding. The broader
              impacts of this proposal are to better establish the use of oxygen isotopes in
              studies of paleoelevation and to test a new cosmogenic method for
              paleoelevation determination. Both of these techniques will be broadly
              applicable to other modern and ancient orogenic systems.
