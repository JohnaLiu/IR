This grant provides partial support for an experimental gas
              source isotope ratio mass spectrometer commissioned from Thermo-Finnigan.  This
              instrument will provide routine analytical capabilities needed to support our
              existing programs in the hydrogen isotope geochemistry of the solid earth and
              atmospheric reduced gases.  Furthermore (and more importantly), it will be the
              first ever built with an experimental collection system designed to
              simultaneously measure relative abundances of common isotopomers (e.g.,
              12C16O16O, 13C16O16O and 12C18O16O measured in conventional mass spectrometry
              of CO2) and very rare isotopomers containing two or more rare isotopes (e.g.,
              12C18O18O, 13C18O16O and 13C18O18O).  These species have unusual thermodynamic
              properties that suggest they can be used to develop intramolecular
              geothermometers;  we also anticipate that their distribution in nature is
              influenced by non-equilibrium isotope fractionations, such as result from
              metabolisms, photochemical reactions, and mass transport.  The natural
              geochemistry of these very rare isotopomers is unexplored and promises to add
              new dimensions to our understanding of the natural cycles of common molecular
              gases (e.g., N2, O2, CO, CO2, N2O - all of which will be analyzable using this
              instrument.
