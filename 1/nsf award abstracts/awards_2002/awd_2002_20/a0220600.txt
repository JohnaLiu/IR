              ABSTRACT

OCE-0220600

The goal of this research is to determine what
              processes control the transport, cycling and preservation of vascular plant
              debris, fossil kerogen, mineral-associated soil organic matter and marine
              phytoplankton in the Fly River/Gulf of Papua (GoP) shelf system.  A PI from the
              University of South Carolina plans to accomplish this task by isolating and
              characterizing these four organic carbon pools (OC) from suspended and bottom
              sediments at the elemental, isotopic and molecular level using a suite of novel
              techniques.  With the results, the PI will address the following three
              objectives:  (1) determine the distribution of the four OC pools within the Fly
              River dispersal system in the GoP shelf; (2) follow the changes in
              concentration and composition of the four OC pools along the dispersal system;
              and (3) determine the sequestration rates and compositional changes of the four
              OC pools during burial in the GoP.
