Abstract    :
              The faculty team at Rochester Institute of Technology has created the EMC^2
              Scholars Program represents a collaborative effort of four academic programs
              (Mechanical Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Engineering, and Computer
              Science) across three colleges, and the Enrollment Management and Career
              Services Division at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). Their program
              builds upon their existing infrastructure for mentoring students, and involves
              their co-operative education program, both of which help students address their
              financial needs and facilitate placement in the high technology
              workforce.

Their scholarship program supports 62 scholars each year. RIT
              will provide an equal matching support to more than double the scholarship
              amount to students positively impacted by the EMC^2 program. RIT's 1.6-to-one
              matching support to this program indicates the university's enthusiasm, a firm
              commitment of support to their students, and an endorsement of the goals and
              objectives of the EMC^2 program.
