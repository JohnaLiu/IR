ITR:  Information Representation for Cooperation Across Networks

We define
              cooperation among the nodes of a network to include any activity 
where the
              action of a single individual relies on information from other 
individuals in
              a shared environment.  Using this broad definition, 
information aggregation
              in sensor networks, group activities performed by 
autonomous robotic devices,
              internet exploration and modeling, and 
establishment of ad hoc networks are
              all examples of tasks involving 
cooperation among the nodes of a network.  An
              essential feature common to 
cooperative tasks is the need to share
              information across a distributed 
system.  Thus cooperation requires the flow
              of information.  In environments 
limited by constraints on power, bandwidth,
              time, or memory, efficient 
information flow requires efficient data
              representation.  We are currently 
studying strategies for efficient
              information representation in network 
systems.  When we speak of information
              representation for a network, 
we consider the network as a whole, asking
              questions about where information 
resides in the network, where it is needed,
              and how to most efficiently 
represent the information to make it accessible
              where it is needed.  
Current topics of investigation include network data
              compression, functional 
source coding for networks, and joint source-channel
              coding for networks.
