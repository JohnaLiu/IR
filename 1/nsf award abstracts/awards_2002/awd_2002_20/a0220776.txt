Abstract    :
              Summary:  This proposal requests support to collect a series of high
              accumulation rate cores from the Indonesian region.  Analyses of the cores will
              be used to document the nature of centennial-millennial variability in the
              Western Pacific Warm Pool and Indonesian throughflow.  The field program will
              obtain a series of cores in depth transects beginning at about 200m water depth
              along the main route of the Indonesian throughflow including the Makassar
              Strait, Sulawesi Sea and Timor channels.  The post cruise analytical program
              will focus on establishing a basic stratigraphic framework for selected cores
              using planktic foraminifer oxygen isotope measurements and AMS 14C dating.  In
              addition surface sediment samples will be used for an initial temperature
              calibration study on shallow water benthic foraminifer Mg/Ca.
