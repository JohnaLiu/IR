Abstract    :
              This project provides 14 undergraduate (upper classman) and 16 graduate
              scholarships, focused enrichment activities and support-services to
              academically talented but financially disadvantaged students including
              non-traditional students and those from underrepresented groups. The
              scholarships promote full-time enrollment and academic success in the Master of
              Science in Systems Technology program and in upper-division computer science
              curricula. The project encourages more students to pursue degrees in advanced
              technology needed for national competitiveness in the global economy of the
              21st century. 

Students' classroom and laboratory experiences are enriched
              through advanced technology utilization, research training, and interaction
              with industry partners. 

Student support strategies build upon institutional
              resources as well as established industry linkage to further Scholars' career
              success. At least half of the scholarships assist students from
              underrepresented groups. Project components include: recruitment; selection;
              financial assistance; student support services including faculty and peer
              mentoring; and professional development, research and internship
              opportunities.
