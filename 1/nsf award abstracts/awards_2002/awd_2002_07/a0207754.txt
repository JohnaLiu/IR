Abstract    :
              This project aims at developing efficient algorithms for multicast communication
              within the optical networks based on Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM).
              The following research activities will be particularly pursued. First, the
              research team will work on the WDM simulators particularly suitable for
              multicast applications based on WDM. Effi-cient specific multicast tree
              construction problems will be formulated and their computa-tional complexity
              will be analyzed.  Second, this project will include more general multi-cast
              problems and seek the appropriate solutions, such as when the set of senders
              and re-ceivers in the multicast group vary. Finally, a part of the research
              will be devoted to the problem of constructing multicast trees in heterogeneous
              networks with different optical node architectures as well as the
              fault-tolerance and Quality-of-Service (QoS) problems related to optical
              multicast built in existing Internet environment and with application-level
              requirements. This project will include undergraduate students in research and
              will thus have substantial impact on their preparation for graduate education
              as well as it will be conducted as means of creating awareness and interest
              among undergraduate students on the issues surrounding optical networks.
