The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will support an eighteen month research
              fellowship by Dr. Linda A. Harris to work with Dr. Tim G. St. Pierre at the
              University of Western Australia in Perth, Australia. Support for this project
              is from the Math and Physical Sciences Directorate's Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities.

The goal of this project is to prepare
              well-defined isolated magnetic nanoparticles encapsulated in an organic sheath,
              and to use these as models for understanding nanomagnetic behavior.  The
              availability of magnetic nanoparticles with well-defined structural features is
              a major hurdle in understanding structure-magnetic behavior relationships.  The
              Pis will synthesize a series of polymers that will serve as nanoreactors for
              the controlled formation of iron oxide nanoparticles.  These well-defined
              materials will function as models to test the hypothesis that constrained
              polymer micelles can control the size and morphology of iron oxide
              nanoparticles.  These methods will be used to synthesize iron oxide
              nanoparticles selectively labeled with 57 Fe at either the particle surface or
              core.  Differentiating the surface vs. core will allow particle sub-structure
              characterization by Mossbauer spectroscopy to enable correlations between
              nanomagnetic behavior and structure.

Professor St. Pierre has over a decade
              of experience in the study of synthetic and biogenic magnetic materials with a
              particular focus on iron oxides.
