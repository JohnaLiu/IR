The International Continental Scientific Drilling Program
              (ICDP) is funding the drilling of a 2km hole in the Chicxulub impact crater on
              the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.  NSF is funding US investigators to analyze
              core samples from the Chicxulub Scientific Drilling Project (CSDP).  The
              Chicxulub crater is one of the world's largest impact craters and has been
              linked to the mass extnction event at the Cretaceous - Tertiary boundary ~65
              million years ago.  As part of the CSDP Science Team, the Principal
              Investigators will look at the Sulfur (S) isotopic systematics of the Chicxulub
              impact site.   They will investigate the mixing between target rocks and the
              bolide at the drill site.  This will be an important contribution to the
              complete characterization of the Chicxulub drill core samples.
