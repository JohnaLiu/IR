The Principal Investigators will conduct high-resolution
              seismic imaging of the San Andreas Fault zone by analyzing data from a
              removable, multilevel and multi-sensor, 3-component seismic array in the
              borehole of the SAFOD Pilot Hole.  Specifically, they will record the borehole
              seismometer string during the active source experiments that are funded through
              other awards.  To these sensors, they will add two mutually orthogonal surface
              spreads to perform a high-resolution, 3D, direct reflection imaging of the SAF
              zone from the surface to the depth of about 2 km.  For sources, they will use a
              downhole vibrator and surface Vibroseis from a reflection/refraction line
              across the borehole site.  The high-resolution seismic experiment will be an
              inexpensive alternative to a full surface 3D survey (very expensive!), with the
              advantages of direct and detailed imaging of the fault zone.
