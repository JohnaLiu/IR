Abstract    :
              This project includes the research activities to obtain theoretical and
              practical results on mechanisms that are incentive-compatible, scalable and
              distributed. Specifically, distributed algorithmic mechanism design with
              insights from game theory is proposed for three related problems in networking:
              interdomain routing, web caching and peer-to-peer file sharing.  The research
              program on interdomain routing will develop a fundamentally new approach in
              which many of the routing-related incentive issues are handled by
              incentive-compatible protocols rather than bilateral contracts; such protocols
              can more effectively address the system-wide issues of efficient routing and
              conflicting policy requirements. Within this project also the recently
              developed techniques for digital-goods auctions will be applied to the
              peer-to-peer file sharing problem and to the design of incentive-compatible
              caching mechanisms. This project will help to understand better the behaviors
              of large-scale, distributed information systems formed by autonomous components
              such as Internet, and develop incentive-compatible algorithms for these systems
              accordingly.
