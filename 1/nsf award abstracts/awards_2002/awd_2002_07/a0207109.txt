Abstract    :
              Experts continue to decry the poor performance of American children on
              standardized mathematics tests.  Hundreds of studies have investigated
              mathematics learning in the formal setting of the school, including analyses of
              teacher-student interactions and best methods for teachers to use in
              instruction.  In contrast, informal mathematics learning in the home has
              received little research attention, and direct analyses of parent-child
              interactions involving math problems have seldom been attempted.  The primary
              purpose of the proposed research is to study mothers as they help their 5th and
              7th grade children with math problems.  The researchers developed a
              standardized mathematics task that can be administered in the home using a
              laptop computer.  Mother-child interactions will be videotaped and coded. The
              approach is based on cognitive social learning theory and Vygotsky's premise
              that the child's intellectual development is heavily rooted in the child's
              social environment, or what Rogoff calls an apprenticeship in thinking.
