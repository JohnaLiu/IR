This collaborative research proposal aims to combine
              high-resolution tomographic datasets with state-of-the-art pore-scale modeling
              techniques to investigate the flow and entrapment of nonaqueous phase liquids
              (NAPLs).  We will focus on mixed-wettability systems and the impact of
              geometric descriptors and anisotropy on multiphase flow.  Synchrotron
              microtomography stations at Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices at
              Louisiana State University and the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National
              Laboratory will be used to capture highly resolved images from multiphase
              porous medium experiments.  In addition to capturing the morphological
              structure of these systems, pore-scale properties (e.g., pore body/throat
              distribution and correlation, tortuosity, connectivity, etc ... ) can be
              calculated from these images.  Researchers at the Johns Hopkins University will
              use the data and results from these experiments to extend their
              pore-morphological approaches to model imbibition.  LB methods will be used to
              accurately model various aspects of multiphase flow including thick wetting
              phase films in strongly water-wet systems, heterogeneous wettability, and
              anisotropic spatial correlations of the pore space.
