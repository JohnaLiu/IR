                The measurement of the low-frequency attenuation behavior of polycrystalline
              olivine aggregates, of olivine-orthopyroxene aggregates and of olivine-based
              partial melts will be pursued.  Specifically, the polycrystalline materials,
              which will have carefully engineered microstructures, will be subjected to
              dynamic ("sub-resonant", oscillatory loading) and quasistatic (constant
              loading, i.e., creep) so as to evaluate the attenuation behavior as functions
              of (i) temperature (1150 to 1350 degC), (ii) frequency (2x10e-4 to 1 Hz), (iii)
              phase volume fraction and morphology (phase percolation and phase
              separation/layering in the solid state; melt segregation beyond the grain scale
              in partial melts), and (iv) dislocation-creep sub-microstructure.  The
              study/characterization of microstructural effects (engineered into these
              specimens so as to mimic deformation-induced microstructures) on
              seismic-frequency absorption is one key to applying seismic data to infer
              deformation behavior in active tectonic terranes.
