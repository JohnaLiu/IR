Abstract    :
              An innovative, but relatively simple, model will be applied to solar Coronal
              Mass Ejection (CME) observations made with the LASCO instrument on board the
              SOHO spacecraft.  Starting with data obtained in 1996, some 150 Earth-directed,
              or so-called "halo", CMEs will be analyzed using a conical model originally
              developed by Zhao, Plunkett and Liu.  From this model one may, in principal, be
              able to deduce sizes and transit times of geoeffective CMEs.  This information
              would be extremely useful to Space Weather Forecasters.  If the method proves
              to be effective, a second component of this effort would involve working with
              Space Weather Forecasters at NOAA's Space Environment Center to develop
              efficient operational techniques to estimate CME travel times based on
              sequences of LASCO images.
