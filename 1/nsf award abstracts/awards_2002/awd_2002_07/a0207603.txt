SGER- Mining
              the Deep Web for Economic Data

This Small Grant for Exploratory Research
              will support exploration of "the deep web;" that is, data which is held in
              web-accessible databases, but which is generally not available via the use of
              standard web-crawlers.  Data held in web databases may be several hundred times
              larger than the web we routinely access, and which is held in html and other
              tagged text files.  The domain to be explored is economic information, to see
              whether these new data can help in economic forecasting.
