     The investigator and his collaborator Douglas Meade
              develop
and implement efficient algorithms for irreducibility testing
              and
factorization of polynomials with small Euclidean norm.  In
addition,
              they classify through similar algorithms all cases
where reducibility occurs
              with Euclidean norm bounded by some
prescribed amount.  Issues relating to the
              complexity and
parallel implementation of such algorithms are considered.
   
               Both factoring and, more generally, computational
mathematics have played a
              vital role in cryptography.  The
importance of algorithms in such applications
              continues to
increase as technology advances.  This project deals
              with
factoring polynomials of high degree from both a theoretical
              and
computational point of view.  The work has application in
cryptography
              and in complexity theory, which deals with the
question of how much work is
              needed to solve certain kinds of
problems.
