Abstract    :
              This proposal pertains to a conference on Designs for Generalized Linear Models
              (GLMs) to be organized by the Department of Statistics, University of Florida,
              and the Statistical Engineering Division of the National Institute of Standards
              and Technology (NIST). The meeting will be of a three-day duration (April
              18-20, 2002) and will be held on the NIST campus in Gaithersburg, MD. The
              Conference will feature leading active researchers in the field of GLMs. One
              goal of the conference is to provide a forum for interaction among people
              working on diverse areas of GLMs. The second goal is to provide a stimulus to
              young researchers and graduate students working in the design area of
              GLMs.

Funding from this proposal will provide travel grants for eight
              doctoral students and junior scientists to attend the Conference. Special
              efforts will be made to solicit applications from members of under-represented
              groups (persons with disabilities, minorities, and women). Priority will be
              given to Ph.D. students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. It is
              hoped that the grant awardees will benefit from the interaction with the
              invited speakers, who can provide mentoring and role modeling for the
              awardees.
