The International Continental Scientific Drilling Program
              (ICDP) is funding the drilling of a 2km hole in the Chicxulub impact crater on
              the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.  NSF is funding US investigators to analyze
              core samples from the Chicxulub Scientific Drilling Project (CSDP).  The
              Chicxulub crater is one of the world's largest impact craters and has been
              linked to the mass extnction event at the Cretaceous - Tertiary (K/T) boundary
              ~65 million years ago.  As part of the CSDP Science Team, the PIs will provide
              a general description of the core for the broader scientific community, so that
              they can request appropriate samples for their studies.  They will also provide
              an initial set of detailed analyses to characterize the impact lithologies in
              the core to better understand the formation of the Chicxulub crater, its
              thermal evolution as it cooled over a period of ~100,000 years, and the
              consequences it may have had for the environment.  The project will include
              petrographic, chemical, and isotopic analyses of surviving target lithologies
              and shock-metamorphosed products of the impact event.
