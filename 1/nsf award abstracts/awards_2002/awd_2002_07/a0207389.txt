The record of the intensity of Earth's magnetic field
              during the past (paleointensity) carries important information about the
              geodynamo and probably about the state of Earth's interior that is not
              contained in the record of paleodirection. Firm conclusions regarding long-term
              paleointensity variation and its role in mantle dynamics require averages of
              many more data than are currently available. For this reason, the investigators
              propose to carry out new determinations of Earth's field during Mesozoic and
              Tertiary time using dated rock materials from Siberia, Kazakhstan, China, the
              Faroe Islands, and Ontong Java and Kerguelen plateaus. The principal objectives
              of this study are focused on three important geophysical problems which are
              currently debated: (1) to obtain reliable paleointensities to test the
              hypothesis that there was an extended period of low field intensity in the
              Mesozoic and, if so, to better define its onset and termination; (2) to
              determine mid-Cretaceous paleointensities to test the recent suggestion that
              the field strength was unusually high during the Cretaceous Normal Superchron
              (CNS); and (3) to obtain mean paleointensity values during the Tertiary period
              of high reversal frequency for comparison with those for the mid-Cretaceous
              period of low reversal frequency to see whether there is a correlation between
              reversal rate and geomagnetic field strength. The rock units the investigators
              have targeted for sampling and those they currently have available have high
              potential of providing valuable paleointensity data to address these questions
              of fundamental importance in geophysics. The opportunity to compare
              paleointensity results from these different geologic materials is a strong
              secondary motivation for this research.
