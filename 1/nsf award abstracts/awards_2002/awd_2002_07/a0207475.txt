This
              project will use experimental phase equilibria combined with thermodynamic
              modeling to revise and extend the capabilities of the FeTi oxide
              thermobarometer.  This thermobarometer is a primary tool used to infer
              conditions under which certain rocks form.  It uses compositions of equilibrium
              pairs of Fe-Ti oxides (a rhombohedral oxide coexisting with a spinel) to derive
              estimates of temperature and oxygen fugacity (fO2) conditions under which a
              mineral assemblage last equilibrated.  Recent experimental studies have
              demonstrated the failure of current formulations of the thermobarometer for
              conditions that exceed the nickel nickel-oxide oxygen buffer.  In addition,
              subsequent to the formulation and calibration of the thermodynamic models that
              underlie the existing thermobarometer, new experimental work has been published
              revising estimates of long-range cation order and greatly clarifying the nature
              of short-range ordering as well as the character of the symmetry-driven phase
              transition in the rhombohedral phase.  Together, these studies motivate a
              revision of the thermodynamic formulation of the thermobarometer to place it on
              sounder theoretical footing and to address the practical necessity of
              estimating T-fO2 in more oxidized parageneses, in particular orogenic arc
              magmas. The revised geothermometer will be distributed as a standalone and
              web-based software product.
