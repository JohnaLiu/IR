The working hypothesis of this proposal is that
              clay/methane-gas hydrate complexes will form under appropriate water-saturated
              conditions at low temperatures and high gas pressures. In a series of
              preliminary experiments, we obtained evidence that these complexes indeed can
              form at these conditions.  In these experiments we used an environmental
              chamber, capable of temperatures from -100 to 200 oC and gas pressures to 75
              bars.  This chamber, which we developed in-house, allows X-ray scans from 0 to
              70 degrees two theta.

We propose to examine Na-exchanged and Ca-exchanged
              montmorillonite and methane under the appropriate conditions to form
              clay/methane-gas hydrate complexes.  In addition, we will examine possible
              interactions between methane and NH4-exchanged montmorillonite. Our intent is
              to determine the compositional range of clays that allow gas hydrates to
              intercalate into clay structures.  We will then determine the P-T conditions
              where these clay/gas-hydrate complexes form, as well as the amounts of gas
              hydrates that are incorporated in the clay. 

The discovery of
              clay/gas-hydrate complexes introduces a new class of materials, which should be
              of interest in mineralogy, geochemistry, and materials science.  As with gas
              hydrates, these new complexes:  (1) may be expected to occur in deep ocean and
              polar regions (e.g., permafrost, Antarctic ice), (2) may be involved in
              submarine sediment stability, and (3) may be present on Mars.  It is probable
              that the stability range of clay/gas-hydrate complexes will extend the
              stability range of gas-hydrate compounds.  Also, clay/gas-hydrate complexes may
              store significant quantities of methane and other hydrocarbons, and thus, these
              complexes may play an important role in climate changes, much like what has
              been proposed for gas hydrates.
