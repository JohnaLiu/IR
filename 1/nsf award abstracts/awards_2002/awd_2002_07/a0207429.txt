Net material cycling between the mantle and continental crust
              occurs primarily in arcs. Many processes related to melting and mass transfer
              in arcs, such as the relative contributions of melting and devolatilization in
              transferring elements from sediment and altered oceanic crust or the relative
              roles of dynamic, decompression or flux melting of the mantle wedge, however,
              remain enigmatic. This Collaborative proposal will focus on Luzon, located in
              the tectonically simpler part of the Philippines arc, to compare two different
              arc settings in close proximity that may have had dissimilar geochemical
              histories. The presumed difference in sediment contribution makes the proposed
              site an ideal setting for studying mass transfer processes and their possible
              effects on mantle melting. Combined U-series and Be isotopic data, in
              conjunction with long-lived radiogenic and trace element data will be used to
              study these rocks.  The following goals are set forth: 1) to characterize
              lavas, using major, trace and Nd, Sr and Pb isotopic data, from four volcanic
              centers, two from each arc in order to delineate attributes of each subduction
              zone; 2) to determine the nature and composition of the sediment component and
              the mechanism by which it is added to the mantle; 3) to investigate the role of
              dynamic melting in arcs; and 4) to investigate the behavior of U-series
              nuclides during magma differentiation.
