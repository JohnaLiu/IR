Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to quantify the light from the overcast sky
              using spectroradiometry and digital imaging to measure the photometric,
              colorimetric, and polarimetric properties of the light with high spectral,
              spatial, and temporal resolution. These observations, taken under different
              meteorological conditions, will constitute a better description of the physical
              characteristics of skylight than hitherto available and thus provide a new
              standard for evaluating different atmospheric radiative transfer models. 
              Broader impacts of the work include contributing not only to atmospheric
              optics, but also to the understanding of cloud effects on radiative transfer
              and climate and to the education of undergraduate students.
