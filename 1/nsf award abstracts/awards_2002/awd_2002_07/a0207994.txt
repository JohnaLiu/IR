Abstract    :
              

Claflin University, the oldest Historically Black College & University in
              the state of South Carolina will implement the project entitled: "Programs for
              the Retention and Enrichment of Science, Engineering and Mathematics Students"
              (PRESEMs). This five-year project consists of a comprehensive approach to
              strengthen Claflin University's undergraduate science, technology, engineering
              and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research infrastructure with the goal
              of broadening the participation of underrepresented minorities in the STEM
              disciplines and workforce.  

PRESEMs will focus on approaches that enhance
              student learning in STEM, such as peer-led instruction, problem-based learning,
              and a research-based curriculum. Aggressively recruiting students, offering
              effective pre-college outreach and summer enrichment programs, implementing
              programs to increase successful completion of gate-keeper courses, enhancing
              undergraduate STEM curricula by modernizing instrumentation, laboratories and
              classrooms, utilizing undergraduate research as a teaching tool - these are the
              strategies required to bring about institutional reform while preparing
              students for graduate study and successful careers in STEM fields.
