Unusual unradiogenic 143Nd/144Nd and 206Pb/204Pb isotopic
              compositions of oceanic basalts from the South Atlantic and other ocean basins
              have been attributed to ancient subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM), or,
              more recently, to lower continental crust, which is thought to have been
              introduced into the oceanic upper mantle at the time of the breakup of
              Gondwana. However, the isotopic composition of the actual SCLM and lower crust
              spatially associated with those unusual oceanic basalts is only poorly
              constrained. It is proposed to test the hypotheses of delaminated SCLM and/or
              lower crust in the source of oceanic basalts by evaluating a direct
              relationship between the composition of enriched oceanic basalts in the South
              Atlantic and continental material potentially delaminated from the sub-Gondwana
              lithosphere. A series of mantle xenolith-bearing kimberlite fields in Namibia
              and South Africa provide a unique opportunity to directly sample the SCLM and
              lower crust in the critical area of the Proterozoic Namaqua-Natal Belt as well
              as the Kaapvaal Craton. Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions as well as trace
              elements on mineral separates from mantle xenoliths, concentrates of
              mantle-derived clinopyroxenes, lower crustal xenoliths and host kimberlites
              from these locations will be used to constrain the composition of the SCLM and
              lower crust at the time of the opening of the South Atlantic. This project will
              be done in collaboration with Dr. Anton le Roex, University of Capetown, South
              Africa.
