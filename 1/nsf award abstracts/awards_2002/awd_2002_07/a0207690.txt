This study continues
              investigations of the paleoseismology and paleogeodesy of the Sumatran
              subduction zone in order to determine possible regularity of periods between
              fault ruptures, repeatability of pattern of slip on faults, influence of
              geologic structure on fault rupture, and variation of seismic/aseismic coupling
              with time. The centerpiece of the study is the use of coral heads (Porites and
              other genera) that are sensitive to sea level changes with uncertainties of a
              few centimeters. Annual growth bands give time-series with relative errors of a
              few years and U-Th dating of the heads gives dates with errors of a decade. The
              magnitude of vertical deformation associated with earthquakes (paleoseismology)
              and deformation in intervals between earthquakes (paleogeodesy) are being
              determined from these data. Results are being modeled and historical
              earthquakes (seismograms from a variety of sources) are being used to determine
              if segment boundaries influenced dimensions of historical ruptures. The
              specific goals of this project are to: (1) better characterize source
              parameters of 1681, 1797, and 1833 events; (2) determine southern limit of
              these events; (3) extend record back to 14th century; (4) determine source
              characteristics of 1861 and 1907 quakes; (5) model historical seismograms of
              large quakes on Sumatran fault; (6) characterize aseismic strain events in
              1861, 1797, and 1833 regions.
