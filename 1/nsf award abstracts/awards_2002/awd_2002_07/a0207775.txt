Abstract    :
              Collaborative activities with the Institute of Ionosphere and Terrestrial
              Magnetism (IZMARIN), and the Institute of Space Research of the Russian Academy
              of Sciences (IKI) will be carried out through joint projects and student
              exchanges. The joint activities will address, (1) the relationship between
              interplanetary shock parameters and their geoeffectiveness, (2) the effect of
              sharp solar wind pressure pulses upon the Earth's magnetosphere, (3) the
              refinement of a neural network prediction scheme to determine how well a solar
              wind monitor will predict plasma flux and velocity and magnetic fields at
              Earth, and (4) comparisons between the time integral of the z-component of the
              interplanetary magnetic field observed at the L1 Lagrange point and other
              spacecraft.
