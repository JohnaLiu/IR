Abstract    :
              The Fields Institute in Toronto, Ontario is running an intensive
program in
              Applications of Set Theory to Analysis from September
to December 2002.  This
              is an award for the support of junior
U.S.  participants in that international
              program.  Long-term
activities in the semester include graduate courses and
              seminars,
and shorter activities include a workshop on Descriptive Set
Theory
              and a workshop on Banach Spaces, Algebras, and Subspaces
of Baire Class 1
              Functions.

Even people whose only contact with higher mathematics comes
              from
watching reruns of "Star Trek" or "The Simpsons" will have
              encountered
the phenomenon that the decimal expansion of Pi requires
              infinitely
many digits. The ratio of the circumference of a circle to
              its
diameter, therefore, is a manifestation of the actual, as opposed to
just
              the potential, infinite. While the existence of the actual
infinite has had a
              profound influence on mathematics, its acceptance
was not immediate and the
              history of the subject is fraught with
controversy.  Two major branches of
              mathematics which devote much of
their resources to the study of the infinite
              are analysis and set
theory. Much of analysis is concerned with understanding
              limiting
behaviour in various contexts. A simple prototype of this is found
              in
considering the number Pi as the limit of increasingly longer
              finite
decimal approximations to Pi. Many of the spaces which analysts
              study
consist of limits of simpler objects. Set theory, on the other
              hand,
studies the infinite in a more abstract setting, concentrating on
              the
combinatorial and structural implications of the infinite. While
              the
connections between set theory and analysis have always
              been
acknowledged, too much of the work in these two areas has gone
              on
largely unheeded by researchers in the other area. The chief purpose
of
              the current proposal is to create an environment where leading set
theorists
              and analysts can collaborate on problems which straddle the
boundaries of
              their subjects.
