EarthScope is a major earth science research initiative
              that will integrate scientific information derived from seismology (US Array),
              geodesy (Plate boundary Observatory), subsurface sampling and measurement
              (SAFOD), remote sensing (InSAR), and complementary geology and geophysics to
              understand continental scale plate deformation and evolution. Funding for the
              EarthScope initiative is currently being discussed in Congress as part of NSF's
              FY 2003 budget.  The Division of Earth Sciences has made FY 2002 funds
              available for projects that qualify as pre-EarthScope activity, i.e. activities
              that will facilitate or enable the construction, fabrication, installation or
              operation of EarthScope once it is funded under the MREFC (Major Research
              Equipment Facilities and Construction) account.  Such activities include
              meetings and workshops, prototype development, site selection or
              characterization.

This award provides funds to support a focused workshop on
              active magmatic systems.  The workshop will provide a forum for
              interdisciplinary discussion of magmatic systems and will result in a detailed,
              integrated deployment and operations plan for the magmatic systems component of
              EarthScope. Participants will be invited from a variety of disciplines related
              to geological, geophysical, and geochemical study of active magmatic systems. 
              The meeting will be conducted in a setting of one of western North America's
              active volcanic systems (e.g. Cascades, Long Valley, Alaska), and will include
              a full-day field trip on active volcanic processes.
