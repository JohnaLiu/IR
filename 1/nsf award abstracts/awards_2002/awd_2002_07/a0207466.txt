The investigators propose to perform a comprehensive
              search for lower mantle discontinuities by using tens of thousands seismograms
              recorded by about 450 broadband seismic stations worldwide in two global and
              one regional seismic networks, and two large portable seismic arrays. About
              70,000 three-component, source-normalized seismograms with strong P (or P_diff)
              arrivals will be used to image the discontinuities by stacking P-to-S converted
              phases, and about 25,000 source-normalized seismograms with strong SS arrivals
              will be used to study discontinuities by stacking bottom-side reflected S waves
              at the mid-point of the source-receiver path. The same amount of synthetic
              seismograms will be stacked to verify the results. Preliminary work from
              stacking about 20,000 P-to-S receiver functions recorded by the Global Digital
              Seismic Network revealed several possible discontinuities at the depths of
              1100, 1600, 2000, 2450, and 2650 km. The stacking amplitudes of those
              discontinuities are about 1/6 to 1/2 of that of P410S, implying that the
              velocity contrasts across those apparent discontinuities are in the order of 1
              to 2%.

The proposed work includes improving the preliminary observations by
              using three times more data, complementing and verifying the P-to-S results by
              stacking SS precursors and using synthetic seismograms, mapping spatial
              variation of lower mantle discontinuities by stacking P-to-S conversions and SS
              precursors in small caps, and finally, making the processed about 100,000
              three-component, broadband seismograms public by establishing a web-based
              database.
