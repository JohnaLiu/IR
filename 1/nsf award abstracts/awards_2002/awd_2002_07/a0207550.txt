Objectives and Significance: The turbo
              principle [27 ],namely,the strategy that exploits the iterated
exchange of
              soft information between di .erent blocks in a communication receiver,has grown
              to be a powerful
tool in attacking a diverse set of problems in
              communications.In particular,the turbo multiuser detection
(MUD)paradigm [59
              ]has attracted signi .cant recent attention as an e .ective technique for joint
              decoding
in multiuser communication systems.However to date the performance of
              various turbo MUD schemes
is largely demonstrated via simulations,and the
              impact of turbo MUD on the network performance (e.g.,
throughput and delay)has
              not been explored systematically.It also remains unclear at this time how
              the
upper-layer functionalities (such as ARQ protocol,power control,and
              admission control)should be designed
to exploit the physical-layer turbo
              MUD.The objective of the proposed project is to develop analytical tools
              to
assess and optimize the performance of various turbo MUD methods,and to
              apply these esults to c oss-layer
design in wireless networks.
Recently a
              technique known as density evolution [66,67 ]has been developed in the coding
              community that
permits analysis of iterative decoding algorithm for in
              .nite-length codewords.In this proposal,under the
density evolution
              framework,we outline a research plan aimed at understanding of the design and
              analysis of
turbo multiuser detection for a variety of channel conditions and
              receiver structures,and the design of some
upper-layer functionalities which
              takes into account the physical layer turbo MUD.While in this study we
focus
              on multiuser CDMA systems,the general principle is applicable to several
              systems,such as space-time
coding systems,OFDM systems,and intersymbol
              interference systems.
