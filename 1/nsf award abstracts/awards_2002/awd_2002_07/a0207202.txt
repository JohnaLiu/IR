This research project is designed to accomplish two
              aims:  Aim 1:  To construct and array high-quality BAC libraries to provide a
              genomic resource on a wide range of species.  Aim 2:  To enable researchers
              working with green algae, non-seed land plants, and seed plants (including
              flowering plants) to identify genes critical for understanding plant form and
              function and how land plants arose and diversified.  This project will enable
              progress toward an understanding of the genetic basis for the transitions that
              mark the most fundamentally important steps in green plant evolution.  The Deep
              Green community (http://ucjeps.herb.berkeley.edu/bryolab/deepgene/index.html)
              will help to provide an infrastructure for ongoing scientific exchange. 
              Bioinformatics and a web site will be provided to the community to access these
              resources (http://www.genome.clemson.edu/).  

Selected Species:  Desired
              coverage is given in parentheses.  Where two coverage values are listed, two
              libraries using different restriction enzymes will be made.
