The goal of this project is to stimulate students from groups
              that are currently underrepresented in the sciences to choose careers in
              environmental biology. This objective will be met by involving students in
              positive and productive research experiences and by providing close mentoring,
              group learning activities, and careful advising. Students will work with
              experienced and aspiring research scientists and environmental professionals in
              seminars and informal gatherings, thus providing a basis for students to
              imagine themselves in careers in environmental biology. Students will
              participate in research focused on understanding 1) the impact of urbanization
              and agriculture via habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation, and 2) the
              effects of introduced species on native species and communities. 

Recruiting
              students from groups underrepresented to careers in environmental biology will
              broaden participation of all parts of our society in learning how to preserve
              the natural environment. Focusing on the impact of habitat loss, fragmentation,
              and introduced species associated with urbanization and agriculture will
              provide valuable information that may enable us to preserve native species and
              communities within a human-dominated landscape.
