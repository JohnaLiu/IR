Abstract    :
              The aim of the project is to advance the development of analytic tools to study
              various asymptotic and singularly perturbed problems, including the
              semiclassical (or zero dispersion) limit of the focusing nonlinear Schroedinger
              equation (NLS) and exponentially small effects in singularly perturbed
              dynamical systems.  Numerical experiments for the focusing NLS reveal the
              formation of regions of violent and disorganized oscillations. This is in
              drastic contrast to the case of the defocusing NLS, which is reasonably well
              understood by now.  The method of Riemann-Hilbert problems will be used to
              describe the complicated behavior of the focusing NLS. The second part of the
              project is connected with the phenomenon of breaking of homoclinic and
              heteroclinic connections in singularly perturbed and discretized systems.

A
              number of aspects of nonlinear optics, such as the stationary profiles of beams
              propagating in nonlinear media and propagation of certain pulses in optical
              fibers, can be described by the NLS equation and its various asymptotic
              regimes.  We will concentrate on one of the most difficult asymptotic problems
              for this equation. The second part of the project investigates the phenomenon
              of transition between integrability and chaos in dynamical systems.
