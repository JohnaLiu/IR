The focus of this project is to apply methods from
              differential 
topology, geometric analysis and algebraic geometry to study
              
symplectic four manifolds.
Symplectic four manifolds can be divided into
              four categories 
according to their Kodaira dimensions, which take values -1,
              0, 1 
and 2. The classification of those with Kodaira dimenision -1
has been
              achieved, to which the investigator has made essential 
contribution. Tian-Jun
              Li proposes to classify those with Kodaira 
dimension 0. Fiber sum is the most
              powerful construction of 
symplectic four manifolds, and one would like
              manifolds 
constructed this way to be minimal. Tian-Jun Li has shown that 
a
              large class of fiber sums are indeed minimal. The investigator 
believes that
              he can prove it for all fiber sums using
his work on the minimal genus problem
              for rational surfaces.


An n manifold is a space that locally looks like
              the Euclidean 
space of dimension n. For example, the space-time universe we
              
live in is a four manifold. 
A symplectic four manifold is  a four manifold
              with
a symplectic structure, a very basic structure that underlies
almost all
              the equations of classical and quantum physics. 
 Thus symplectic four
              manifolds
play a central role in mathematics and physics.
 The investigator
              aims to gain some understanding of the 
fundamental problem: classifying
              symplectic four manifolds.
