Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for a mini-symposium June 3-5, 2002 to
              commemorate the numerous contributions of Dr. Egon Balas on the occasion of his
              80th birthday.  Dr. Balas is a long time NSF grantee in the Operations Research
              program and one of the World's leading contributors to the field of
              combinatorial optimization.  He has made many fundamental advances and has won
              most of the prestigious awards for distinguished achievement in mathematical
              programming and operations research.  The meeting will include talks at Dr.
              Balas' Carnegie-Mellon University from numerous distinguished speakers in the
              area of combinatorial optimization.  NSF funding will help support
              participation by doctoral and postdoctoral students, and selected invited
              speakers.
