Floreana Island is the most distinctive volcano of the
              Galapagos hotspot system. Unlike other Galapagos Islands, Floreana experienced
              extensive explosive activity, and its alkalic lavas are anomalously enriched in
              incompatible trace elements, exhibit evidence of metasomatism, have unique
              isotopic compositions, and contain abundant mantle xenoliths. The fundamental
              goal of the proposed project is to use Floreana's unique features to elucidate
              the magmatic processes that construct and modify the lithosphere forming the
              Galapagos Platform, which will be accomplished through a detailed volcanologic,
              petrologic, and geochemical study.  Determining the volcanic history and
              compositional evolution of Floreana volcano will permit estimation of
              variations in the depths and extents of melt production through analysis of
              major and trace element variations and how those change with time. These
              results will be applied to questions about Floreana's volcanic evolution,
              including: a) the relationship between the different eruptive sequences; b)
              apparent shallow depths of melting, which may contradict a deep plume origin;
              c) compositional variations within single eruptive episodes; d) the
              relationship between Floreana lavas and the giant volcanic terraces which
              underlie the southern Galapagos Platform; and e) the origins of the xenoliths
              and their relationship to Floreana lavas and other parts of the Galapagos
              lithosphere. The powerful combination of high precision geochemical and
              petrologic analysis coupled with detailed field observations will provide a
              rare opportunity to gain insight into elusive questions about plume-lithosphere
              interaction, ocean-island magmatism, and, ultimately, mantle evolution.
