This award provides partial support to upgrade the
              computational facilities for the solid-earth geophysics program at New Mexico
              State University.  This upgrade enables the geophysics program to stay abreast
              of technological advances in computing, networking, security, and archiving. 
              Purchasing a 16-node Beowulf cluster is central to our efforts.  It will
              provide high-speed computational power for relatively low-cost.  There are two
              major projects, mantle dynamics and microstructural evolution of rocks, which
              require three-dimensional parallel simulations.  Most of these simulations are
              currently being done at off-campus sites using the TERRA mantle convection code
              developed at Los Alamos and a Monte Carlo code developed at Sandia National
              Laboratories.  They will be implemented on the Beowulf.  Support will also be
              used to replace our current system of older Sun workstations with more modern
              workstations.  New storage with a RAID array and large-volume tape backup are
              needed for today's larger data volumes.  These computer systems will support
              data storage and analysis from field seismology projects located in China, the
              southwest U.S., and Mexico, and to support projects in seismic tomography and
              geodynamics.
