This award provides continued funding for the CD-ROM
              (Continental Dynamics of the Rocky Mountains) collaborative investigation which
              is designed to understand the tectonic evolution of the lithosphere of the
              southern Rocky Mountains.  A transect from Wyoming to New Mexico is providing
              an opportunity to evaluate the hypothesis that lithospheric architecture of the
              Southwest reflects a resolvable mixture of structures that formed during early
              Proterozoic assembly of the continent and modifications that took place during
              younger intracratonic tectonism that were themselves influenced by the
              Proterozoic compositional structure.  Phase 1 (1997-2001) was successful in
              substantially verifying this hypothesis.  The PIs imaged the Cheyenne Belt and
              Jemez lineament;  both are interpreted to be Paleoproterozoic paleosubduction
              zones that also show long-lived and strong influence on younger intracratonic
              tectonism.  Both are also associated with lateral changes in deep chemical
              lithosphere, such that the mantle provinces can be linked to crustal provinces,
              demonstrating the antiquity of the mantle transitions.  

With this "bridge
              funding" award, the Principal Investigators will conduct an annual workshop,
              complete the analysis of data sets generated in Phase 1, increase productivity
              in terms of published papers, and prepare for Phase 2 of the CD-ROM
              project.
