Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding to cosponsor a workshop focusing on rigorous
              optimization methods applied to radiology for the treatment of cancer. The
              workshop is a collaborative effort between the National Science Foundation and
              the Radiation Research Program (RRP) of the National Cancer Institute, NIH.  
              The workshop brings together 25 to 30 experts in radiation physics, biology and
              radiation oncology, and operations research experts from optimization research
              and systems engineering to discuss significant problems of the treatment plan
              optimization in radiation biology. The workshop takes the form of presentations
              and panel discussions.  This is a three day event on February 7-9, 2002 held in
              Washington, DC.

A summary of the workshop will be posted on the Web.
