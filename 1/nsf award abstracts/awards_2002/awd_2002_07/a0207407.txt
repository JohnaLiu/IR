The International Continental Scientific Drilling Program
              (ICDP) is funding the drilling of a 2km hole in the Chicxulub impact crater on
              the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico.  NSF is funding US investigators to analyze
              core samples from the Chicxulub Scientific Drilling Project (CSDP).  The
              Chicxulub crater is one of the world's largest impact craters and has been
              linked to the mass extnction event at the Cretaceous - Tertiary (K/T) boundary
              ~65 million years ago.  As part of the CSDP Science Team, the Principal
              Investigators will carry out a collaborative and multidisciplinary effort that
              addresses three main topics:  1) the age of the Chicxulub impact, 2) evidence
              of multiple impacts, and 3) environmental and biotic consequences of the
              impact(s).  The research falls into two categories.  The first is an
              investigation of CSDP core samples by the PI to determine the age,
              biostratigraphy, faunal turnover, and paleoenvironment of deposition based on
              planktic and benthic foraminifera, and the correlation of this data with
              sections throughout Central America.  The second is a collaborative research
              effort with other team members involving analyses of CSDP core samples for
              impact glass, sedimentology, geochemistry, and mineralogy.
