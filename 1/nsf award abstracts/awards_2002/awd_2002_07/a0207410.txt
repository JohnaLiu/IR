Abstract    :
              	This dissertation will investigate the gentrification process in the
              Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn.  Women entrepreneurs engaged in retail
              business selling stylish goods (clothing, accessories) may be an important
              early stage of gentrification.  Because of this, a consumer culture of
              aesthetics may be an important element of neighborhood change, not just a
              consequence of the resulting gentrification.  The research combines archival
              administrative records and census data with interviews with 50 women
              entrepreneurs and 40 others including neighborhood real estate interests,
              long-term store owners, and citizen activists.  The results should form a
              narrative account of the new dynamics of neighborhood reinvestment that
              reflects the city's transition from a small manufacturing to a service base.
