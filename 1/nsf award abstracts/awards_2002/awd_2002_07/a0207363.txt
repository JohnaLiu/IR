Abstract    :
              Professor Li first proposes to study the synthesis of C-glycosides in water. 
              This group will first investigate the coupling of aryl halides with aldehydes
              in water then move to coupling reactions involving carbohydrates.  This
              methodology will then be applied to the synthesis of several polyhydroxylated
              natural products.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program is supporting the research of Dr. Chao-Jun li of the Department of
              Chemistry at Tulane University.  Dr. Li will work on the development new
              carbon-carbon bond forming reactions which can be used to prepare carbohydrates
              in water.  When developed, Dr. Li's work could be applied to the
              environmentally friendly syntheses of a number of biologically active molecules
              which contain the carbohydrate framework.  Students trained during the course
              of this work will gain skills needed by the pharmaceutical and speciality
              chemicals industries.
