                                          The Rio Grande Rift Seismic Transect (RISTRA)
              project is designed to study the crust and mantle beneath the southwestern U.S.
              utilizing an exceptional data set consisting of 18 months of broadband
              teleseismic IRIS PASSCAL data from 57 sites along a 1000-km transect in TX, NM,
              AZ, and UT recorded during 1999-2001.  Under initial NSF funding extensive
              fieldwork was completed, data were processed and archived at the IRIS data
              management center, and preliminary analysis was performed and disseminated to
              the earth science and broader communities.  This project continues the analysis
              of RISTRA to illuminate and interpret structure and processes associated with
              the Rio Grande Rift (RGR), Colorado Plateau (CP), and Great Plains (GP) at
              unprecedented resolution.  Principal goals are to determine the: (1) nature the
              support of the present high elevation of the CP; (2) depth extent of mantle
              processes associated with surface morphology and tectonics; (3) connection
              between mantle and crustal strain beneath the RGR region; (4) location in the
              mantle of remnants of the Farallon plate and any possible detached continental
              lithosphere. Imaging of discontinuities using receiver function methods is
              being coupled with studies of shear wave splitting, 3-D seismic tomography,
              xenolith, and other geological/geophysical constraints to reveal the structure
              of the region to depths of approximately 800 km. Seismic migration processing
              techniques that take full advantage of the quality, length, and dense (~18 km)
              station spacing of the RISTRA experiment are being applied. Elastic 2- and 3-D
              modeling efforts are being incorporated into the DOE/SEG Next Generation
              Modeling (NGM) Project in association with Los Alamos National Laboratory and
              the University of Houston.
