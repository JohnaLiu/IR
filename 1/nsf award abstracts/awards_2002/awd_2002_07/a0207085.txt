Abstract    :
              A grant has been awarded to Drs. Stephen Giovannoni and Michael Rappe to survey,
              inventory, grow and describe new species of marine bacteria from coastal waters
              of the Pacific Northwest.  Previous studies of gene sequences from seawater DNA
              have provided compelling proof that many species of marine microorganisms are
              virtually unknown, probably because technologies in routine use in
              microbiological laboratories do not provide the conditions these cells need to
              replicate.  This project will employ a new technology developed at Oregon State
              University that miniaturizes and automates the process of culturing microbial
              cells from nature.  This new technology uses concentrations of cells and
              nutrients that are approximately 100,000 fold lower than those used by the
              culturing technologies now in routine use.  Specifically, this survey will
              sample oceanic waters off coastal Oregon, within a rectangle described by the
              coordinates 44 degrees 12' to 45 deg. 02' N; 124 deg. 03' to 124 deg. 38' W. 
              Samples will be taken from throughout the water column at depths ranging to 200
              m.  In addition to supporting research that isolates and identifies new strains
              of microorganisms, and inventories them, this project will support the
              maintenance of a culturing facility that will distribute cell cultures or
              genomic DNA to other laboratories for further study.  Properties of the newly
              cultured species of cells such as their physical size, genome size, abundance
              and distribution in Oregon coastal seawater, the nutrients they use and the
              metabolic pathways that operate in them, will be studied to determine their
              relationship to other microorganisms, and those strains that are new to science
              will be named.

This project will provide new knowledge about microbial
              biodiversity in the exceptionally productive coastal waters of the Pacific
              Northwest.  The resulting cultures of microorganisms and information about them
              will fill gaps in basic knowledge about coastal ecological processes.  The
              cultures themselves will also be a resource for academic and industrial
              scientists who seek to develop new agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals from
              microbial biodiversity.
