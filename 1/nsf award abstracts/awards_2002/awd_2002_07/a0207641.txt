Abstract    :
              This investigation will address the question:  Is the quiet solar chromosphere
              at the top always hot (7000 K), with small temperature variations (5%), or
              mainly cold (2000 K), with large temperature excursions (up to 25,000 K)?  Two
              kinds of current empirical models, one a set of time-independent models of the
              steady emission, the other, a time-dependent simulation of the dynamics of the
              non-magnetic chromosphere, come to fundamentally different conclusions.  To
              gain a resolution of this problem a two-pronged approach will be employed.  On
              the one hand, space observations are to be analyzed to determine the
              temperature and the amplitude of oscillations in the actual solar chromosphere,
              and on the other, numerical and analytic tools will be developed for a
              theoretical assessment of chromospheric heating by magnetohydrodynamic waves.
