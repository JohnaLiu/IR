EarthScope is a major earth science research initiative that will
              integrate scientific information derived from seismology (US Array), geodesy
              (Plate boundary Observatory), subsurface sampling and measurement (SAFOD),
              remote sensing (InSAR), and complementary geology and geophysics to understand
              continental scale plate deformation and evolution. Funding for the EarthScope
              initiative is currently being discussed in Congress as part of NSF's FY 2003
              budget.  The Division of Earth Sciences has made FY 2002 funds available for
              projects that qualify as pre-EarthScope activity, i.e. activities that will
              facilitate or enable the construction, fabrication, installation or operation
              of EarthScope once it is funded under the MREFC (Major Research Equipment
              Facilities and Construction) account.  Such activities include meetings and
              workshops, prototype development, site selection or characterization.

This
              award will provide funds to support the deployment of dense linear seismic
              arrays across and along the San Andreas fault (SAF) near the SAFOD drilling
              site at Parkfield, CA to record fault-zone trapped waves generated by
              explosions and microearthquakes.  Since the features of fault-zone trapped
              waves strongly depend on the fault geometry and physical properties, these
              waves can be used to determine spatial and temporal variation in fault
              properties with high precision.  This experiment will be a supplement to other
              seismic experiments at Parkfield scheduled in the Fall of 2002.
