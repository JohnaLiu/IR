The PI proposes a study of seismic velocity and attenuation
              structures for both the Earth's inner and outer core and their implications for
              mineral physics and dynamics. The seismic structures will be studied based on
              the differential travel times and waveforms of various PKP branches collected
              from the global and regional seismic networks. Seismic studies will be
              performed for the "eastern" and "western" hemispheres respectively, and in two
              steps:  1) establish two one-dimensional seismic velocity and attenuation
              models of the Earth's inner and outer core for the PKP phases sampling
              equatorial paths; and, 2) constrain anisotropy magnitudes and transitions from
              a possible top isotropic layer to deep anisotropy in the inner core.
