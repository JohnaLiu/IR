This project will investigate the magmatic history of the
              Earth's crust over the past 4.4 billion years. The mineral zircon will be
              analyzed for oxygen isotope ratio, U-Pb age, and rare earth element
              concentration. The high melting temperature, chemical inertness, and hardness
              of zircon creates a time capsule of geochemical information that lasts
              virtually forever in samples with low amounts of radiation damage. New ion
              microprobe and laser techniques for high precision and accuracy, and/or high
              spatial resolution will be employed. Single domains within zoned zircons will
              be analyzed. Igneous minerals will be studied from selected terranes of early
              Archean, Proterozoic and Mesozoic through Cenozoic age. Archean samples will
              include detrital zircons from the Jack Hills, Western Australia, where we
              discovered the oldest known sample of the Earth in the past grant period. The
              younger samples will document processes of crustal reworking in the Idaho and
              Sierra Nevada batholiths of the western U.S.  Analyses of zircon will be
              compared to new data for magmatic garnet, baddeleyite, titanite, epidote,
              rutile and quartz. In combination, these results will provide a record of
              evolving compositions including pre-magmatic xenocrysts, magmatic phenocrysts
              and a range of post magmatic alteration minerals.
	
These studies of zircons
              and associated igneous minerals will have broad significance for understanding
              the origin and evolution of the Earth's crust. Studies of the Archean (4.0 to
              4.4 Ga) zircons provide the only evidence of the earliest conditions on Earth.
              The recent hypothesis of a "Cool early Earth" will be tested, which has
              implications for the timing of the first oceans and the origin of life.
