This GOALI proposal is a continuation of the
              PI s work on electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) to characterize complex
              three phase flow in fluidization processes.  The novel aspect of this proposal
              is the image reconstruction technique based on the unsupervised analog neural
              network multi-criteria optimization technique.
