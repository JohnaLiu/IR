EarthScope is a major earth science research initiative that
              will integrate scientific information derived from seismology (US Array),
              geodesy (Plate boundary Observatory), subsurface sampling and measurement
              (SAFOD), remote sensing (InSAR), and complementary geology and geophysics to
              understand continental scale plate deformation and evolution. Funding for the
              EarthScope initiative is currently being discussed in Congress as part of NSF's
              FY 2003 budget.  The Division of Earth Sciences has made FY 2002 funds
              available for projects that qualify as pre-EarthScope activity, i.e. activities
              that will facilitate or enable the construction, fabrication, installation or
              operation of EarthScope once it is funded under the MREFC (Major Research
              Equipment Facilities and Construction) account.  Such activities include
              meetings and workshops, prototype development, site selection or
              characterization.

This award provides funds to hold a workshop on the role
              of complementary geophysics in the EarthScope program.  By complementary
              geophysics is meant those geophysical techniques and data that are not at the
              core of the EarthScope facilities initiative, including gravity, magnetics,
              magnetotellurics, electromagnetics, petrophysics, heat flow, geophysical well
              logs, remote sensing data, TM images, DEM data and industry seismics.  The
              principal focus will be on the "value added" aspect of the complementary
              geophysical data.  It should be noted that a similar workshop to consider
              complementary geologic effors will be held at the GSA Annual Meeting in Denver
              in October, 2002.
