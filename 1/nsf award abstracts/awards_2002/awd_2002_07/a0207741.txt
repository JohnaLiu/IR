In this project the investigators will use a
              thermochemical numerical convection code to investigate the trace and major
              element evolution of Earth's mantle.  The model self-consistently integrates
              the processes of convection, plate tectonics, and melting-induced trace-and
              major-element defferentiation and mixing.  The investigators will focus
              particularly on testing various hypotheses that have been proposed by members
              both of the geophysical and primordial reservoirs, the necessity or otherwise
              of having a deep, thick, enriched layer, and several other topics.  The focus
              will be on high-resolution 2D calculations in order to minimize discretization
              'noise' when calculating isotope ratios, but complemented by a small number of
              3D calculations.  The results should be to closely constrain the viability of
              competing hypotheses for Earth's trace element structure and evolution.
