              Paleobiology of the Doushantuo Formation: Multiple Taphonomic Windows into the
              Late Neoproterozoic Biosphere

Abstract

This study will focus on the
              Neoproterozoic Doushantuo Formation (550 - 600 Ma) in South China. The
              Doushantuo Formation was deposited across the Yangtze Platform in South China
              during a critical geological time interval, - probably after the Neoproterozoic
              climatic crises but before the Ediacaran radiation of macroscopic animals. The
              Doushantuo Formation is also known to contain three extraordinarily clear
              taphonomic windows preserved in phosphorites, cherts, and carbonaceous shales.
              These complementary taphonomic windows allow us to understand the taphonomic
              bias associated with each taphonomic pathway and, in combination, they provide
              a more complete picture of the Neoproterozoic biosphere.
The goals of this
              study is to improve our knowledge about the early evolution of multicellular
              organisms by further documenting phosphatized, silicified, and carbonaceous
              biotas in the Doushantuo Formation, to understand the constraints imposed by
              these different taphonomic pathways by comparing and contrast these taphonomic
              windows, and to expand the investigation of Doushantuo paleobiology into
              deep-water facies. The PI and his colleagues will conduct extensive fieldwork
              on the Doushantuo Formation in the next three years in order to understand its
              distribution, sedimentary environment, and paleobiology.
