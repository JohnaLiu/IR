Abstract    :
              The objective of this workshop is to bring together international researchers
              and practitioners dealing with localization in geomechanics. The focus of the
              2002 workshop will be to collect and debate the applications that have taken
              place since the first workshop in 1988. The scope of the workshop will include
              analytical solutions, numerical methods, experimental techniques, and case
              histories. Besides the presentation of fundamental research findings,
              applications in geotechnical, petroleum, mining, and bulk materials engineering
              will be emphasized.

Failure of many geotechnical structures is characterized
              by the formation and propagation of zones of localized deformation. For
              example, a noticeable feature of slope and underground failures in soft rock
              and overconsolidated clay is the appearance of slip surfaces or shear bands,
              the characteristics of which are associated with deformation being concentrated
              in narrow zones and the surrounding material appearing intact. The appearance
              of localization or other bifurcation modes often manifests itself in specimen
              or system instability under specific loading conditions. The mathematical
              formulation of bifurcation phenomena and related instabilities constitutes the
              basis of a continuum theory of failure. This theory and its applications, as
              well as the methodology of analyzing instabilities in general, are crucial in
              adequate modeling and safe design of numerous geotechnical engineering
              problems.

Five international workshops on bifurcation and localization in
              geomechanics have been held in Europe, Japan, and Australia: 1. Karlsruhe,
              Germany: 1988. 2. Gdansk, Poland: 1989. 3. Aussois, France: 1993. 4. Gifu,
              Japan: 1997. 5. Perth, Australia: 1999.  The University of Minnesota was
              selected as the site for the 6th Workshop to be held on June 2-5, 2002.
