Abstract    :
              An interdisciplinary research project is proposed to test the hypothesis that
              groundwater-fed wetlands may be used as paleoclimatic indicators in equatorial
              East Africa. The study will integrate geochemical, biological and
              sedimentological data from a large modern freshwater wetland (Loboi Wetland,
              near Lake Bogoria, Kenya) and compare these data to nearby Pleistocene Loboi
              Silts and Kapthurin Formation that may contain ancient wetland sediments. The
              link to paleoclimate will be made by locating repetitive alternations (cycles?)
              of lithofacies that record wet-dry cycles within a datable ancient
              stratigraphic sequence. The two Pleistocene sites that we have selected show
              great promise. The field work, laboratory analyses and preliminary integration
              of the results from modern and ancient environments will be carried out over a
              one year period.
