The primary goal of this
              project is to develop a mathematical analysis and computer model of the
              movement of magma within volcanoes. Eruptions are normally driven by the growth
              of gas bubbles that come out of solution in the magma due to reductions in
              pressure before and during magma ascent within the volcano. The project
              consists of two parts. The first is a mathematical and computer analysis of
              volcanic eruption processes. The second is a sensitivity analysis to determine
              how the model system responds to variations in each of a number of attributes
              of the volcanic system. This should elucidate the roles and relative importance
              of all relevant factors in driving volcanic eruptions. The numerical model will
              enable us to explore the interaction of magma ascent, bubble growth, bubble
              size distribution, temperature change, and other specific volcanic processes.
              The proposed model is not intended to simulate specific natural eruptions.
              Rather, the results of the model and sensitivity study should lead to a better
              understanding of the mechanisms by which bubble growth drives eruptions, and an
              understanding of how magmatic conditions, properties, and conduit geometry
              affect the style of volcanic eruptions. This will set the stage for determining
              the conditions under which to expect explosive volcanic eruptions and their
              related volcanic hazards.
