Abstract    :
              This project will develop a self-consistent model of the near-Earth portion of
              the plasma sheet.  It will specify the particle distributions, the effects of
              the plasma sheet on the magnetic field, and the effects of the plasma sheet on
              the formation of the ring current during magnetic storms.  The approach will be
              to use test particle tracing techniques in conjunction with an MHD code.  The
              technique will couple the particle tracing with the MHD modeling in a way that
              will produce a self-consistent model without using the basic MHD approximations
              that are invalid within the inner plasma sheet.  This approach has already been
              used in modeling the quiet-time plasma sheet and the method will now be
              extended to conditions of enhanced convection, including the growth phase of
              substorms and convection bays (steady magnetospheric convection).  During the
              later stages of the project the model will be extended beyond a 2-D plasma
              sheet model to include field-aligned currents within the plasma sheet.
