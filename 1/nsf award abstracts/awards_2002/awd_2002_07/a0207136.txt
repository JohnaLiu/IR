The goals of this study are to provide additional
              constraints to improve our knowledge of the Galapagos plume and its interaction
              with the Galapagos Spreading Center. Two scientific issues pertaining to the
              geological evolution of the Galapagos will be addressed as part of this study. 
              Firstly, in order to understand which processes are responsible for the
              geochemical variations of the Galapagos lavas and which current model is most
              suited to explain them, we propose a study that combines oxygen and radiogenic
              isotope analyses with major and trace elements compositions on the same sample
              set.  Secondly, we propose to develop a geodynamic picture of the upwelling
              velocities and melting of the mantle beneath the Galapagos archipelago.
              Traditionally, geodynamic pictures of mantle upwelling and melting have been
              obtained through detailed geophysical studies. In the last 15 to 20 years, the
              study of U-series (238U-230Th, 230Th-226Ra, 235U-231Pa) has allowed scientists
              to image the mantle upwelling and melting using a geochemical tool. In contrast
              to other radiogenic isotope systems, the short half lives of the U-series will
              allow us to get a first look at the present-day mantle composition, the extent
              of melting represented by a suit of lavas and estimate the mantle upwelling at
              different points in the archipelago. The combination of U-series, oxygen and
              other radiogenic isotopes with major and trace elements contents measured in
              the same samples combined with ongoing geophysical studies, will provide our
              best opportunity to obtain a reliable geodynamic image of the Galapagos plume
              and the surrounding asthenosphere.
