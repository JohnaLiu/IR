Abstract    :
              
Through the QUEST program, Central State University (CSU) will enhance STEM
              access, student retention, curricula, undergraduate research, transition to
              graduate school and faculty development positively impacting its largely
              African - American student population. STEM student learning will be improved
              by the adoption of a hybrid combination of the Learning Communities and the
              Peer-Led Team-Learning systems. Student and faculty research opportunities and
              student internship opportunities will significantly increase through
              arrangements with partner institutions. 

Program activities will impact more
              than 1000 on-campus students and 150 pre-college students through bridge
              programs.  QUEST efforts will result in a 60% increase in freshman STEM
              enrollment, an increase in freshman retention from 63% to 70%, and STEM
              graduation rates of at least 54 students per year above current rates,
              including an additional 22 students per year graduating with GPAs of 3.0 or
              higher. CSU STEM students in the graduate school pipeline will increase by a
              factor of 3 above current levels. The number of students engaged in research
              projects and internships will increase by at least 20% per year.
