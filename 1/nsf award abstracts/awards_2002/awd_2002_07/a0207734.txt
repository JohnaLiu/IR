Our aim in this project is to understand the driving
              forces behind volcanoes that display persistent, strombolian activity.  Such
              activity is characterized by repeated, mildly explosive events.  For such
              repetitive explosive activity to be maintained over hundreds-to-thousands of
              years, as it has been at Stromboli Volcano (Italy), a volcano must be fed by a
              stable supply of magma and gas.  It has not yet been determined, however,
              whether this supply occurs by the repeated rise of discrete magma batches or by
              a continuous stream.

Initial measurements by us at Stromboli during May 1999
              indicated that the magma supply to the shallow system may indeed be variable
              over minutes-to-hour long periods (i.e. it may be batch-like).  These supply
              variations may in turn drive observed variations in the style and frequency of
              explosive activity.  This has led us to develop a working hypothesis that
              fresh, gas-rich magma batches do rise from depth as discrete pulses, causing
              fluctuating levels of degassing and hence explosive activity upon their
              arrival.  Our current project builds on those initial measurements by adding
              new geophysical instrumentation together with more detailed examination of
              volcanic products. 

In particular, we will use thermal and infrasound
              measurements, plus studies of the textures of the erupted lava bombs to examine
              explosive activity at Stromboli and infer variations in magma level within the
              conduit.  Thermal data acquired during the persistent degassing that occurs
              between strombolian explosions will be used to characterize periods of enhanced
              gas escape.  Finally, we will use vesicle (gas bubble) and crystal size
              distributions in the bombs to constrain the extent of mixing between newly
              arrived magma batches and long-resident magma within the shallow system.
