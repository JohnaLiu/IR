Abstract    :
              The PI will coordinate field work at the Pipe Creek Sinkhole, a recently
              discovered site in Grant County, Indiana, which preserves unconsolidated
              sediments containing a diverse late Tertiary assemblage of animals and plants. 
              The study will be a collaborative effort between Indiana-Purdue University,
              Fort Wayne and the Indiana State Museum (the repository for specimens).  Field
              work will comprise on-site wet-sieving and concentration of sediments (some
              sediment samples will be bagged for later sieving in the lab).  Sieve
              concentrate will then be picked for small fossils in the lab.  The PI will
              create a database in which each identifiable specimen will be associated with
              records about the sample and size fraction of sediment from which it came. 
              This will eventually be used to analyze the paleoecology of the site.  In
              addition, the PI will set up a lab for preparing thin sections of lower
              vertebrate bones from the assemblage for osteohistological/skeletochronological
              analysis relevant to reconstructing the late Tertiary paleoclimate in the
              region of the Pipe Creek Sinkhole.
