Abstract    :
              This project involves the development and utilization of 3-dimensional
              photochemical models and their application to field data from the eastern U.S. 
              The models will be used to elucidate the chemical mechanisms for the formation
              of ozone, odd hydrogen, peroxides, nitric acid, and secondary reaction products
              of biogenic hydrocarbons.  This project will use data from recent field
              programs including the Texas Air Quality Study in Houston in 2000, and the
              ongoing (since 1996) ozone Photochemistry and Climatology Experiment at a rural
              site in Pellston, Michigan.
