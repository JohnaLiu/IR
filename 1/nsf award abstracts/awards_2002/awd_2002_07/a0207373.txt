Abstract    :
              Descriptive Complexity measures the richness of a language or sentence
needed
              to describe a given property. The languages are variants of
first-order logic
              and their targets are finite, ordered structures.  There
is a profound
              relationship between the traditional computational complexity
of a problem and
              the descriptive complexity of the problem; indeed, all
major complexity
              classes have been shown to have natural descriptive
characterizations.  This
              means that complexity can be understood entirely
from a logical point of view.
               As a consequence, important new
understandings about complexity have arisen
              from the descriptive point of
view.

The current research involves three
              major topics: (a) The theory of dynamic
complexity, which is especially
              appropriate for database complexity, is
being studied.  Complete problems for
              dynamic complexity classes are being
developed and the complexity of important
              dynamic problems such as graph
reachability are being investigated; (b)
              Promising new methods for proving
lower bounds techniques on the descriptive
              complexity of problems have been
developed and are now being extended; and
              finally, (c) A Descriptive
Programming environment is being developed in which
              the computational
complexity of checking whether an input satisfies the
              properties being
described can be read from the face of the description.
