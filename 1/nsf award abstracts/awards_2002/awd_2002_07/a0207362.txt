	Magma must ascend to the Earth's surface prior to
              erupting.  Field and theoretical studies over the past decade have shown that
              the rate of magma ascent plays a critical role in determining the style, and
              violence, of the ensuing eruption. This dependence results from physical
              changes that the magma undergoes as it ascends (decompresses).  Bubbles
              nucleate, grow, and coalesce during decompression; crystals may also nucleate
              and grow. The presence of bubbles and crystals, in turn, affects the magma's
              ability to flow (its rheology), and thus its continued ascent.  For this
              reason, development of an accurate model of magma ascent and eruption requires
              that we understand both the distribution of bubbles and crystals as a function
              of depth below the Earth's surface and the effect of bubbles and crystals on
              magma rheology.  We propose to address both of these questions through a
              combination of experimental, theoretical and field-based studies.  Our specific
              goals are: (1) to determine the effect of suspended crystals on the rheology of
              bubble-bearing melt; (2) to use the bubble structure of volcanic samples to
              estimate shear (velocity) profiles across volcanic conduits; and (3) to examine
              the permeability (bubble-interconnectedness that permits gas escape) of
              volcanic clasts as a function of both their bubble and crystal content.
