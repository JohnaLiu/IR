Abstract    :
              This project addresses a new and unique technique for estimating the daytime,
              vertical ExB drift velocities in the equatorial ionospheric F region from
              ground-based magnetometer observations.  It has recently been demonstrated,
              quantitatively, that the strength of the daytime upward ExB drift velocity is
              linearly related to the difference between the horizontal H component values
              measured by a magnetometer located on the magnetic equator and one 6 to 9
              degrees away in latitude.  This project plans to extend the results of this
              unique finding by asking the fundamental question:  How does this delta H
              versus ExB relationship vary with season, geomagnetic activity and solar
              activity?  An answer to this question provides answers in turn to a variety of
              space weather scientific questions as well as applying the technique,
              immediately, to Operational Real Time Ionospheric Specification and Forecast
              Models currently under development in support of civilian and military
              customers.
