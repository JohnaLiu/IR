Abstract    :
              The team, lead by Nolan, will purchase, validate, and distribute a new, high
              resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the Kuparuk River watershed in
              northern Alaska, for use by all NSF funded scientists who require such data for
              their research.  In the Alaskan Arctic the only DEMs commonly available are
              those from the USGS, with pixel size of roughly 60 m x 90 m and vertical
              accuracy of about 15 m.  These DEMs often have large errors at the sheet
              boundaries, making them difficult to mosaic accurately.  In contrast, the
              Star3i X-band airborne-radar system operated by Intermap Technology
              Corporation, creates a topographically seamless DEM at 5 m pixel size with a
              mean vertical error of 1 to 3 m, depending on product purchased. Intermap
              acquired the Kuparuk watershed in August of 2001, and this DEM is now available
              as an off-the-shelf product.  

The distribution package made available to
              NSF researchers will include more than the raw data.  The team will validate
              the new DEMs for accuracy,  principally through comparing hydrologic channel
              networks created from the DEMs with those found in the real world.  They will
              also produce vector layers of these stream channels for use in many GIS
              applications, and calculate some basic hydrological information on the
              watershed. They will include a variety of shareware software to allow novice
              users to easily access the data, as well as include a number of still images
              and animations for use in analysis and outreach. Finally, they will include a
              number of references and technical specifications to help new users understand
              the limitations of the data. 

The DEM will be made available to all NSF
              researchers through JOSS.
