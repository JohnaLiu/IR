Abstract    :
              The focus of the project is the observation of the dynamics of subaqueous
              volcaniclastic sedimentation from eruption-fed density currents, and the
              characteristics of the resulting deposits.  Since the processes in question are
              almost impossible to observe in the field, an alternative approach will be
              employed here: the use of laboratory tanks to perform experiments that
              reproduce the deposits.  The experiments have been designed to model as
              accurately as possible three settings: a) lacustrine turbidites of the Taupo
              volcano, New Zealand, b) submarine hyaloclastites consisting of limu shards and
              c) eruption-fed density currents of the style of Pahvant Butte.  The results
              will be used to extend existing numerical models of turbidity currents to the
              case of 2-D and 3-D currents laden with vesiculated grains of variable size and
              density as well as hot water.  The numerical models will provide new predictive
              tools for the study of volcaniclastic stratigraphy.

This research represents
              a collaborative effort between Gary Parker of the University of Minnesota
              (turbidity currents) and James White of the University of Otago, New Zealand
              (subaqueous volcaniclastic deposits).
