Abstract    :
              With the dramatic increase in the amount of multimedia data,
              efficiency
considerations make it important to consider ways to keep the data
              in the compressed form for as much as possible, even when it is searched. We
              propose to develop methodologies for searching directly on compressed text and
              images, when the compression is based on the family of compression algorithms
              that depend on sorted context. We also propose to develop search-aware data
              compression schemes for text and images based on sorted context that will
              support compressed-domain search directly on the compressed data.

For text,
              we will explore the applicability of the classical linear exact pattern
              matching algorithms  and binary search algorithms for text
compressed with the
              Burrows-Wheeler transform. We will develop similar
compression schemes for
              images based on sorted image contexts, called
LICSIC (Lossless Image
              Compression by Sorted Image Contexts).
The results of the proposed research
              will be important in environments
that require the organization and management
              of huge collections of text
or images. Internet search engines, digital
              libraries, satellite and space data , geographical information systems,
              bio-informatics and medical diagnostics are typical candidate applications.
