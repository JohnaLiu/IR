Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for the Social Science Research Council to conduct an
              inventory of existing linkages between U.S. and South African institutions. 
              The goal of the inventory is to identify existing gaps in U.S.-South Africa
              collaborations in research and training, and to contribute to the development
              of priorities for future collaborative activities.  The inventory will
              specifically survey collaborations in social science research and capacity
              building activities devoted to training in all fields.  It will thus serve as
              an important resource for U.S. researchers and universities in identifying new
              potential partnerships with South African scientists and higher education
              institutions.  In consultation with the National Science Foundation and
              relevant components of the South African research community, the SSRC will
              develop the scope and terms of reference for the inventory, identify a small
              team to carry out the study, and oversee data collection and the production of
              a report that will be completed in various stages.  Preliminary results will be
              available in January 2002 with a final report completed in the summer of 2002.
