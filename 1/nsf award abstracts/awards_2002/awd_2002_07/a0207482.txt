Abstract    :
              The proposal is to establish a US-EU/DELOS working group on "Digital Archiving
              and Preservation".  The working group will meet over the next year to discuss
              and evaluate fruitful joint activities and research paths for collaborative
              activities in this general topical area.  The EU component of the effort is
              funded and managed by the DELOS Forum, a major organizer of digital libraries
              research and planning activities in Europe.  DELOS receives support from the
              Information Societies Technologies (IST) 5th Framework Programme of the
              European Commission. 

This effort continues the planning and assessment
              activities begun by an earlier NSF-EU working groups' process.  In their final
              report "An International Research Agenda for Digital Libraries", delivered in
              Brussels in October 1998, increased levels of collaboration and interaction was
              seen as critical to building multi-lingual, multi-national digital libraries.
              The objective of the new working groups, of which this is one, is to define a
              research agenda on a specific topic and identify areas and activities for
              cooperation between EU and US researchers. The efforts of this particular group
              take the next step in the planning process by assessing future directions for
              research and resource development related to archiving and preservation of
              digital content.
