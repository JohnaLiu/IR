This research program addresses the study of carrier
              transport in advanced silicon carbide (SiC) devices. The research focuses on
              the modeling, fabrication and electrical characterization of advanced SiC
              devices, including n and p-channel MOSFETs, and novel surface and
              buried-channel DIMOS and IGBT devices with particular emphasis on their
              utilization for power switching applications. The research emphasizes the
              development of a low temperature fabrication sequence to reduce the detrimental
              effects of 'step bunching', while simultaneously achieving the required
              activation of the implanted species. A goal of the research is to increase
              carrier inversion and accumulation-layer mobility through a combination of low
              temperature processing with an optimized gate dielectric. The research focuses
              on the physical modeling of carrier mobility where electrons move in localized
              states at the SiC-SiO2 interface and are thermally activated into extended
              states in the conduction band. A combination of thermal activation, surface
              roughness and point Coulomb scattering all play a role in limiting the carrier
              mobility and hence the specific ON resistance of SiC power MOSFETs. The study
              of both electron and hole transport is important in planar SiC integrated
              circuit technology, particularly for 'smart' power applications. The research
              employs novel test structures, fabrication techniques and instrumentation to
              study the influence of surface and bulk traps on carrier transport in inversion
              and layers over an extended temperature range, while contributing to the
              advancement of SiC devices, particularly power semiconductor devices.
