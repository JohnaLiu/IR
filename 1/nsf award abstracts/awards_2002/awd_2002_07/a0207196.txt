Abstract    :
              The activities of this proposal are aimed at exploiting the "Forbush decrease",
              a region of suppressed cosmic ray density located downstream of coronal mass
              ejection (CME) shock fronts, for the purpose of predicting with a lead time of
              some 4-8 hours the arrival of a CME at Earth. Muon detectors and neutron
              monitors will be utilized to detect the loss-cone anisotropy of energetic
              particles which escape from the "Forbush decrease" plasma. From this
              information, it is possible to infer useful constraints on the orientation and
              extent of solar ejecta. The principal efforts will be to close a coverage gap
              by constructing a full-size muon detector at the Southern Space Observatory, in
              Sao Martinho, Brazil, and to add features to their website
              (www.bartol.udel.edu/~neutronm/) giving real-time graphical displays of cosmic
              ray density gradients, angular anisotropies, and bi-directional flows.
