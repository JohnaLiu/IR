The investigators have documented a mode of convection in
              both 2D and 3D Cartesian convection calculations with mobile plates where the
              plate motion changes on a time scale comparable to the time scales of plate
              reorganizations observed on Earth.  This proposal will further our
              understanding of coupled plate-mantle convection.  Over the past few years, 
              the field has developed a substantial understanding of the interaction of
              geometrically fixed plates and mantle convection; and it is appropriate to
              consider calculations where the plate boundaries evolve with time.  It is
              proposed to use a yield-strength constitutive-law rheology in a series of
              calculations using the aspect ratio, Rayleigh number and internal heating
              values used in the plate reorganization studies by Lowman, King and Gable
              (2001, submitted).  There are two specific questions that this proposal will
              address:  When plate boundaries are allowed to evolve dynamically in the
              yield-strength rheology calculations, are the rapid plate reorganizations that
              we have seen in previous calculations accompanied by changes in plate
              boundaries?  Second, under what conditions (i.e., what activation energies and
              critical yield-strengths) are the constitutive-based plate methods able to
              produce plate-like surface velocities during and after a plate reorganization
              event?
