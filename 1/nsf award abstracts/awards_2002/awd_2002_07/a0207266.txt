Abstract    :
              The collapse of the WTC Towers and destruction of surrounding buildings were
              accompanied by damage to underground water distribution, electric power,
              natural gas, steam, wastewater conveyance, telecommunication, and
              transportation systems. This research aims to investigate and model complex
              system response, involving underground facilities that are often taken for
              granted or overlooked in comprehensive emergency planning. Understanding and
              documenting how underground infrastructure performs during extreme events is a
              necessary step for increasing the resilience of urban utility and
              transportation networks. This research will strive to extend the knowledge
              gained to understand the interdependencies of underground infrastructure and
              improve their security in future extreme events. In addition to investigating
              integrated system response in New York, the research will compare the effects
              of intense localized damage at WTC with infrastructure system performance
              affected by distributed damage during major California earthquakes. Response
              during extreme events will be compared with the effects of previous severe
              accidents in New York. Three activities are involved: 1) data collection and
              interviews with system managers; 2) comparative analysis; and 3) methodology
              for assessing interdependencies. Some of this work has already begun.
              Deliverables include recommendations for developing a methodology to evaluate
              the damage, areas of greatest vulnerability, and the possibilities of cascading
              damage. Eventually, a methodology will be sought that adapts risk management
              techniques used in industrial process control to decision support systems for
              civil infrastructure managers.
