This project will renovate and upgrade the fluid inclusion
              laboratory at Washington State University, which serves as a regional research
              facility with the University of Idaho.  This facility is heavily used by
              students and researchers at the two cooperating universities, including more
              than 45 M.S. and Ph.D. theses in the past 20 years.  Fluid inclusions provide
              direct evidence of the hydrothermal characteristics of many past and present
              geological systems. Fluid inclusions have been instrumental in the study of
              many geologic processes and are a standard part of most studies of ore
              deposits. Use of the fluid inclusion laboratory at Washington State University
              ranges from studies of pollen spores, to geothermal systems, to structural
              geology, to economic geology, although the majority of studies have been of ore
              deposits. Meinert et al. (1997) is an example of a recently published fluid
              inclusion study that demonstrates the capabilities and use of the lab.  The new
              equipment includes a Linkham heating/freezing stage and supporting IR
              microscope/video equipment.  This equipment allows the routine measurement of
              heating and freezing temperatures of fluid inclusions in both transparent and
              semi-opaque materials.
