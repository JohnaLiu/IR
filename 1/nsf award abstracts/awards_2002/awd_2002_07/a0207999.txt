Abstract    :
              Optical communication, in particular, wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)
              technique, has become a promising networking choice to meet ever-increasing
              demands on bandwidth from many emerging bandwidth-intensive
              computing/communication applications. As optics become a major networking
              media, optical interconnects will inevitably play an important role in
              interconnecting processors in parallel/distributed computing systems.   This
              research focuses on fundamental challenges and issues 
on using optics in two
              converging areas: parallel/distributed computing and communications. The
              objective of this research is to design high-speed, cost-effective optical
              interconnects for current and future generation parallel/distributed computing
              and communication systems.  Due to the unique characteristics of optics, many
              important issues of optical interconnects, different from those of 
electronic
              interconnects, need to be addressed. Specially, this research focuses on (1)
              explore unique properties and classifications of WDM interconnects; (2) optimal
              and cost-effective designs; (3) study the effect of wavelength conversion; (4)
              performance modeling; (5) fault-tolerance issues.  The proposed research
              combines architecture/circuit design, algorithmic, probabilistic, combinatorial
              and simulation 
techniques to conduct comprehensive studies on the above
              issues.  The research results will provide viable solutions for designing
              high-bandwidth, high-connectivity, low-latency and low-cost optical
              interconnects. The proposed research will have a significant impact on next
              generation arallel/distributed computing and communication systems and future
              networking infrastructure.
