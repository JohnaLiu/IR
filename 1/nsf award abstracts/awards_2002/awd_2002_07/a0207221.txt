Abstract    :
              The operation of the Bruny Island Radio Spectrometer will be secured for the
              next five years.  This facility makes radio observations between 3 MHz and 47
              MHz, and has pioneered the use of modern digital techniques to avoid and
              largely excise the very strong terrestrial radio interference that is normally
              prevalent in this frequency band.  It is the only instrument in the world that
              bridges the gap between low frequency solar radio observations made from space
              and the higher frequency observations made from the Earth's surface.  As such,
              it will continue to provide unique observations capable of tracking
              interplanetary shock accelerated particle events between where the space-based
              observatories cutoff and where the ground-based receivers begin.  Ancillary
              activities will address how the observed type II and type III radio bursts are
              related to the generation of solar energetic particles.
