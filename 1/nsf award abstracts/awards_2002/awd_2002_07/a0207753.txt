The project initiates collaboration between
              scientists at UNAM (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico) and the University
              of Colorado at Boulder.  The long-term purpose is to develop an improved
              seismic model of the crust and mantle beneath Mexico and the Cocos Plate.  At
              present, there is no reference model for the region of study, which places
              limitations on the effectiveness of seismic hazard assessments.  An improved
              higher resolution model is also motivated by a series of problems related to
              the structure and tectonics of Middle America, especially the enigmatic
              subduction characteristics of the Cocos Plate and the desire to understand the
              roots of the Mexican Volcanic Belt.  The collaborative work will begin by (1)
              transferring three years of Mexican National Seismic Network (MNSN) data to
              CU-Boulder for future processing and analysis and (2) developing a thermal
              model of the Cocos Plate mantle wedge beneath Mexico from the current
              CU-Boulder 3-D seismic model.
