magnetic anomalies generated by ocean-floor rocks have
              led to sea-floor spreading models and plate tectonics. The magnetism resides in
              titanomagnetite in fresh basalts, but the titanomagnetite oxidizes to
              titanomaghemite over geological time. Whether this titanomaghemite carries a
              magnetization that faithfully reflects the ancient magnetic field, is still an
              unanswered question. The investigators plan to study the degradation of the
              magnetic signal as a function of age. In particular, the intensity of the
              magnetization of the basalts (and, concomitantly, the peak values of the
              anomalies) appears to show a gradual degradation up to some 20 million years
              ago, beyond which the intensity gradually increases for Early Tertiary and
              Cretaceous times. The researchers will be studying the rates and effects of
              oxidation, the magnetic intensity of unaltered and oxidized rocks, and the idea
              that perhaps older basalts may have a natural remanent magnetization that
              consists of two anti-parallel components, which were acquired during successive
              normal and reversed polarity intervals. The methods to be employed include
              paleomagnetic and rock magnetic techniques and electron microscopy of the
              oxides. This project will show whether the causes for magnetic degradation
              warrant a re-evaluation of the details of the global polarity time scale, or
              whether magnetic intensity variations are a function of the global geomagnetic
              field. The latter possibility would create new insights into the origins of the
              geomagnetic field that are currently the subject of much debate.
