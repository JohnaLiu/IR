This project seeks to better understand the generation
              mechanism for the Earth's magnetic field.  This geophysics grant funds research
              in a new device designed to self-generate magnetic fields at parameters close
              to the Earth.  This new device drives liquid sodium to flow in a three-meter
              spherical tank.  The tank and the enclosed propellers rotate independently to
              drive a sodium flow to stretch and amplify magnetic fields.  The goal is to
              better understand the saturation mechanism, which determines the strength of
              the Earth's field, as well as characterize the dynamics of a saturated
              self-generating dynamo state (such as reversals).  New diagnostics are planned
              to better characterize the fluctuations in the magnetic field and the fluid
              velocity, including ultrasound velocimetry, spherical magnetic field sensors,
              and a magnetic field imaging array.  The effects of rotation and Lorentz forces
              on the velocity and magnetic fields are specific issues these diagnostics will
              probe.  This scientific exploration seeks to shed light on the dynamics of
              field self-generation on a wide variety of objects showing active fields (the
              Earth, the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, Io) as well as those lacking self-generation
              such as Venus.
