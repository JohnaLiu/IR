Abstract    :
              An MPS Distinguished International Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (MPS-DRF)
              will be used to perform research with P. A. Madden and his group at Oxford
              University for a period of two years.  The proposed research is molecular
              dynamics and polarizable MD simulations on ion materials.  The following
              specific projects are proposed: (1) development of MD simulation techniques for
              highly polarizable systems, (2) development and refinement of transferable
              systems from first principle, and (3) study of ionic conduction and nuclear
              quadrupole coupling.
