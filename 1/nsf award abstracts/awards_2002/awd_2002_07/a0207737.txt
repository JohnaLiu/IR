This grant supports the acquisition of new computational
              equipment to upgrade the facility available to the terrestrial geophysics
              research program at Washington University - St. Louis.   Specific equipment to
              be purchased will include three Sun Fire 280R servers, three Sun Blade 1000
              2-processor workstations, 2 DLT-800 tape drives, a color printer, and a Xiotech
              Magnitude SAN 612 Gb disk array.  Much of the current research conducted by the
              2 faculty members and 6 Ph.D. research scientists/post-doctoral scientists  in
              this group has become either computationally intensive or storage intensive. 
              Synthetic seismograms, tomographic inversions, and inversions for geomagnetic
              field variations require processor speeds that exceed current machines.
              Washington University is also currently involved with four IRIS PASSCAL
              seismometer deployments which will involve the processing and analysis of about
              700 Gb of seismic data. Obtaining a system of fast and reliable machines will
              allow this program to carry out research in an optimal and productive
              manner.
