Abstract    :
              

The "Talladega College Science and Mathematics Improvement Program"
              addresses the problem of low levels of African American participation in
              science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines and
              workforce through enhanced STEM teaching and learning that will result from
              sustainable improvements of the institution's STEM instructional and research
              infrastructure.  Infrastructure enhancements will address (1) student
              recruitment, enrollment, retention and graduation; (2) curriculum reform and
              improvement, infusion of technology to enhance instruction, undergraduate
              research; and, (3) faculty development.

Curriculum reform efforts include
              revision and enhancement of STEM gate keeper courses, development of honors
              courses in biology, chemistry and computer science; and the establishment of an
              Environmental Science Program.
 Faculty will be provided professional
              development opportunities to enhance their competence and currency within STEM
              disciplines and to effectively incorporate technology and active learning
              techniques into the learning process. Students will be provided opportunities
              to engage in research activity on-campus and at research institutions under the
              tutelage of research scientists.
