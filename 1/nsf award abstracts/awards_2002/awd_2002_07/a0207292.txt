Abstract    :
              PI will spend a month (August, 2002) in China studying primitive Middle Cambrian
              echinoderms from the Kaili Fauna at the Guizhou University of Technology in
              Guiyang as well as at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology in
              Nanjing.   There are very good possibilities that primary symmetry in
              echinoderms (based on the symmetry of the ambulacral system), early
              evolutionary development of columnar structures and their holdfasts can be
              deduced from some of the material. Most specimens are preserved as molds and
              extensive latex casting will be an important part of the data gathering.  At
              present there is good evidence that the sediments associated with the fossils
              are not extensively bioturbated, which makes the mode/mechanism of attachment
              to the bottom very important: it will be extensively investigated.  Study of
              this material may well open up a whole new understanding of the early evolution
              of this important biotic group and the collections are available at this time
              for joint investigation with Chinese colleagues.
