Abstract    :
              This work is a collaborative effort to study the transformation and removal of
              ozone and fine particles in the air due to multiphase atmospheric chemistry
              related to aerosol acidity.  The chemical measurements made will augment the
              planned 'core' measurements obtaining during the Atmospheric Investigation,
              Regional Modeling, Analysis and Prediction (AIRMAP) program field intensive
              scheduled for July and August 2002.  The objective of these additional
              measurements is to assess the significance of pH-dependent, gas-particle
              interactions with respect to the cycling of odd nitrogen, sulfur and other
              chemical species in the Gulf of Maine boundary layer.  This work contributes to
              interagency collaboration in aerosol science between NSF and NOAA.
