Abstract    :
              Broad-band extremely low frequency waves (BBELF) are correlated with the heating
              of the topside auroral ionosphere.  This project will examine BBELF waves from
              a theoretical and computational standpoint to determine what role these waves
              play in the energization of ions.  Results from previous research indicate that
              the BBELF waves are driven by plasma instabilities arising from the shear in
              the parallel electron currents in the ionosphere.  Understanding the
              characteristics of the waves will lead to an understanding of the mechanism of
              transverse ion energization and the mechanisms that mediate the coupling of the
              ionosphere and magnetosphere.
