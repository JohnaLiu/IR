Abstract    :
              This project involved the development and application of a
              proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) for on-line detection and
              identification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for the analysis of primary
              and secondary biogenic carbonyls in complex VOC mixtures released from
              vegetation.  The new instrument, a proton-transfer ion trap mass spectrometry
              (PT-ITMS) instrument, will be developed for used in both field and airborne
              platforms for continuous, simultaneous analysis of important VOCs and their
              carbonyl oxidation products.  VOCs released from vegetation may have a major
              impact on the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere and in the formation of
              ozone and aerosols.
