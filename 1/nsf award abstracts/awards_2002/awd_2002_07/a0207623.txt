Abstract    :
               Under this grant, the researchers will create a detailed framework for
              designing teacher induction programs that emphasize learning about mathematics
              and science teaching.  The framework will be derived from the profiling of 25
              induction programs for middle and high school teachers.  Based on this profile,
              seven to eight intensive case studies will be conducted, collecting data on
              context, content, effects on teacher behavior and on student outcomes.  The set
              of programs selected for study will represent a variety of induction
              strategies, activities and providers.
