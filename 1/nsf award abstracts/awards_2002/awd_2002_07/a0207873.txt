Highly instrumented, real-time, dynamic
              idealized experiments are being used to model earthquakes in the laboratory
              towards a comprehensive understanding of the basic physical phenomena governing
              earthquake rupture.  Laboratory experiments are performed by creating idealized
              two-dimensional models made of Homalite-100 or polycarbonate.  These materials
              are birefringent, enabling the use of the optical technique of dynamic
              photoelasticity.  Photoelastic fringe patterns are captured and recorded
              throughout experimental events by high-speed photography (2 million frames per
              second), enabling the inference of real-time full-field stress field evolution.
               A custom high-speed infrared camera (1 million frames per second) is also
              being used to image thermal fields due to rupture.  Dynamic specimen loading is
              accomplished by gas gun fired projectile impact or by an exploding wire system.
               Specific areas of study are: (1) nature of rupture propagation (crack-like vs.
              pulse-like); (2) experimental verification of the achievable range of rupture
              speed (limited to ~0.8 times the material's shear wave speed vs. supershear);
              (3) determination to what extent differences in properties (e.g., wave speeds)
              across inhomogeneous crustal faults promote directionality of rupture; (4)
              conditions of rupture across step-overs or jogs in en echelon faults (e.g.,
              successive triggering, jumping, or slowing down of ruptures); (5) investigation
              of whether ruptures incident on fault bends or branches get transmitted, slow
              down, arrest, or bifurcate creating new fault surfaces; (6) nature of
              frictional heat dissipation, asperity heating, local melting, and lubrication
              along active faults.
