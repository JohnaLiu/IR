     The principal investigator and his colleagues
              develop
computational stochastic dynamic programming methods to
              find
approximations to optimally control the expected objective value
for a
              wide variety of applications.  These applications include
the optimal
              treatment of cancer by chemotherapy drugs, the
optimal financial investment
              portfolio and parameter estimation,
optimal control of stochastic
              manufacturing systems, and the
optimal remediation of ground water pollution. 
              The wide scope of
testbed applications helps to increase the robustness of
              their
advanced numerical methods by having to treat a variety of models
and
              boundary conditions.  Another characteristic of many of these
applications is
              that the most severe changes happen as jumps of
the system and many models
              utilize stochastic jump-diffusion
processes.  The computation of optimal
              approximations in jump
environments is a unique feature of the models, where
              increased
realism of the models more than compensates for the added burden
of
              increased computational complexity over diffusions.  The
investigator is
              writing an applied book with a colleague on
stochastic processes and control
              emphasizing jump-diffusion
models to give broader impact to their more general
              results.  The
mathematical level is intermediate so that it is accessible
              and
useful to those who actually work with real applications in
science,
              engineering, and finance.
     The principal investigator and colleagues study
              models of
systems in uncertain environments and seek optimal
              computational
approximations to get the best performance from these
              systems.
Many of the applications are national challenges.  One
application
              is the optimal management of cancer chemotherapy when
cancer cells develop
              resistance to a cancer drug combination.
The impact of finding optimal cancer
              treatment schedules would be
significant because cancer is a leading cause of
              death.  Another
application is computational solutions for optimal
              investor
portfolio and consumption problems in a market with crashes
              in
value; the benefit is a better understanding of our nation's and
the
              world's financial systems.  A third application is the
optimal scheduling of
              manufacturing systems subject to uncertain
failures, repairs, and other
              disruptions.  Here improved
efficiencies are important for the national
              economic well-being.
A fourth application is the optimal remediation of
              pollution in
ground water, with important environmental consequences. 
              Students
are involved in these projects, providing them with
              significant
experience in interdisciplinary research.  Finally,
              the
investigators are writing an intermediate level applied book on
the
              optimal control of systems in uncertain environments with
large changes,
              integrating their results over a wide variety of
applications.  The aim is to
              bring these ideas in a more
accessible form to scientists and engineers.
