Physical process simulation can be used as a too] to help
              reconstruct the spatial pattern of sediments comprising aquifers used for water
              supply.  Sedimentary evolution is simulated using a process-imitating model,
              based on large-scale mathematics, that describes hydrologic, sedimentary, and
              tectonic events which have occurred over hundreds of thousands of years.  The
              specific processes of interest are major floods, sedimentation, erosion,
              compaction, subsidence, sea-level variation, and regional-scale fault motion. 
              The product is a quantitative too] to study aquifer stratigraphy and its
              evolutionary link to paleohydrology and tectonic conditions.  This tool can be
              used in hydrogeologic investigations where the large-scale pattern of relative
              flow paths and flow barriers is important.

The field area for application is
              the Santa Clara Valley in northern California, which is 
Approximately 240 mi2
              Groundwater provides approximately half of the public water supply in Santa
              Clara Valley, yet pumping has caused a serious problem of land subsidence due
              to clay compaction.  In most areas, the controls on groundwater flow and land
              subsidence imposed by aquifer heterogeneity and confining bed geometry are
              poorly understood.  The Valley occupies a structural depression within a block
              bounded on the cast and west by the Hayward-Calaveras and San Andreas Fault
              systems. Respectively.  The multiaquifer system consists of coalescing alluvial
              fans interfingered with estuarine deposits that have been formed over the past
              600,000 years.  The sedimentary process simulation model results will be
              compared to geologic and hydrogeologic data covering certain portions of the
              Valley.  The goal is to use the model to interpret the roles played by various
              past hydrologic and geologic processes on the development of alluvial-bay
              aquifer architecture.
