                             Paleomagnetic directions measured from 240 lava flows in 5
              sequences on the island of O'ahu (Hawaii) cover about 0.36 Ma of geomagnetic
              field changes and include detailed records of the successive Gilbert-Gauss
              (3.57 Ma), Lower Mammoth (3.33 Ma) and Upper Mammoth (3.22Ma) reversals. Thus,
              it is clear that proper analysis of these observations require to document the
              total field vector and thus to conduct an exhaustive study of absolute
              paleointensity.  The objectives of the study are primarily related to the
              knowledge of the field variations during periods like reversals or excursions
              but also to the critical time intervals that precede and follow reversals that
              so far have been only documented from a few sedimentary sections with
              conflicting observations.  The Wai'anae sequences offer the first exceptional
              opportunity to document field variations over a time period that includes
              several polarity intervals and thus document the field vector over various time
              constants.  This is a basic condition to extract and bring up significant
              constraints for theoretical and numerical modeling of the geodynamo.  Multiple
              records offer the best approach to determine the suitability of the field
              values and the degree of confidence of the results.
