Abstract    :
              0207061  Clark  The objective of the research is to investigate the feasibility
              of new methods to degrade or destroy persistent chlorinated contaminants.  This
              exploratory research will focus on the toxaphene, a pesticide banned in 1990,
              which is toxic and very difficult to degrade.  Toxaphene is a complex mixture
              of more than 200 polychlorinated terpenes.  This research will examine the
              dechlorination of toxaphene by zero-valent iron and other bimetallic substrates
              as a means to initiate its degradation.  Experiments are proposed to determine
              the degradation rates of toxaphene by iron substrates, potential pathways of
              toxaphene dechlorination, and the potential rate limiting factors for this
              process.  These preliminary results would be used to seek variations in
              experimental procedures and optimization of the dechlorination experiments.
