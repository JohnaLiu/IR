Abstract    :
              The team of S. Burges and P. De Vries (Univ. of Washington) and G. Parker (Univ.
              of Minnesota) plan collaborative research into the mechanics of coarse bedload
              transport at the particle scale.  Gravel tracer particles are a convenient way
              to study the longitudinal travel and dispersion and vertical mixing of sediment
              in mountain rivers.  Field observations of tracer displacement have not yet,
              however, been linked comprehensively into the formal framework of sediment
              transport in rivers.

The study will use experiments as a bridge between
              theoretical/numerical research and field-scale research to a) develop
              formulations for distance moved, dispersion and mixing of tracers for unsteady
              flow, b) link these formulations to mechanistic theories of bedload transport
              and c) test and validate the results against field data taken to the standards
              needed to test theory and numerical predictions.

The field research will be
              conducted in several streams in western Washington State.  The experimental
              research will be conducted at St. Anthony Falls Laboratory.  The Washington and
              Minnesota teams will collaborate on both efforts, with both sides contributing
              to the development of a predictive numerical model.
