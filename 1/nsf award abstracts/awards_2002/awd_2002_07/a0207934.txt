This award will fund a range of studies of the equations
              of state, sound velocity, thermochemical properties, and thermal conductivity
              of important model earth materials in the system MgO-SiO2 under conditions
              accessible only by shock loading of targets that are porous, pre-heated, or
              specially synthesized dense starting phases. The investigators' multianvil
              method allows routine preparation of polycrystalline samples of mantle minerals
              of a size and shape suitable for high-quality shock compression studies.
              Experiments with majorite, ilmentite, wadsleyite, ringwoodite, and perovskite
              starting materials and completion of studies on MgSiO3 glass and gem quality
              enstatite, will yield data at multiple internal energy states, from which the
              Gruneisen parameter will be extracted under lower mantle conditions. This award
              will also fund construction of an optical line-imaging VISAR (Velocity
              Interferometer System For Any Reflector) that will allow measurement of
              longitudinal and bulk sound velocities under high shock pressure by the
              overtaking method. This method allows comparison of mineral sound velocities
              with the Earth itself as well as determination of melting temperatures at
              ultra-high pressure. Experiments on both porous and preheated MgO will
              determine its melting behavior above the range previously studied with diamond
              cell anvils, resolving the enormous discrepancy between theoretical high
              pressure melting models for MgO and present data to 40 GPa.
