Abstract    :
              This project develops new statistical approaches for the analysis of ocean
              circulation data and prediction of the ocean's influence on weather.  In the
              first part of the project, Bayesian hierarchical methods are devised 
for
              assimilating hydrographic data into ocean circulation models.  In the second
              part of the project, Bayesian semiparametric regression models are used to
              produce improved forecasts of heating-degree day probability density functions.
