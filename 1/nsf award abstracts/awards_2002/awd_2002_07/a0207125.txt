 This award provides partial
              support for active research mathematicians with limited means 
 of support to
              attend and participate in the Conference on Inverse Spectral geometry to be 

              held at the University of Kentucky, June 20-28, 2002. The conference will
              consist of two 
 parts. The first (June 20-22) is a series of special lectures
              by Steven Zelditch  
 (Johns Hopkins University), Richard Beals (Yale
              University), Peter Perry 
 (University of Kentucky), and Tanya Christiansen
              (University of Missouri) covering inverse 
 spectral problems, scattering
              theory, and analysis on the Heisenberg group. The second is 
 a workshop on
              inverse spectral geometry (June 24-28) with three morning lectures and one 

              afternoon lecture to allow maximum time for discussion and collaboration. 

              Conference themes are:

 (1) Scattering theory for the Heisenberg group and
              Two-Step Nilpotent Lie Groups 
 (2) Direct and inverse scattering problems for
              the Laplacian on exterior domains and 
 non-compact Riemannian manifolds 

              (3) Geometric invariants which are (are not) spectral invariants on compact 

              Riemannian manifolds 
 (4) Geometry of the Hodge Laplacian on p-forms on
              compact  Riemannian manifolds
