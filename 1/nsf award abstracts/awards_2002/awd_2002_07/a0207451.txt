     The investigator and his colleague study
              high-order-accuracy
computational methods for linear and nonlinear waves,
              with
emphasis on shock wave calculations and simulation of
electro-magnetics
              waves.  The work includes the development and
analysis of high-order finite
              difference, finite element, and
spectral methods, as well as applications of
              these methods to
computational fluid dynamics and computational
              electro-magnetics.
In particular, the efforts include the following
              components:
high-order methods for shock wave calculations, including
              finite
difference WENO schemes, spectral methods for supersonic
              reactive
flows, and finite element discontinuous Galerkin methods;
high-order
              methods for Maxwell's equations; and perfectly matched
absorbing layers.
    
              Computers are now used more extensively in engineering and
other applied
              sciences.  An important component to effectively
use computers is the design
              and analysis of efficient numerical
algorithms.  Important applications such
              as computer-aided design
of aircraft are to a large extent dependent on
              efficient and
reliable algorithms designed by applied mathematicians. 
              The
high-order methods the investigators develop and analyze in this
project
              should significantly increase the efficiency and
reliability of algorithms
              used in crucial application areas such
as aerospace industry, communications,
              and material science.
