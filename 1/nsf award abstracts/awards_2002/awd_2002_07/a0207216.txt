              Seawater Calcium Isotopes and Carbonate Deposition
              History

ABSTRACT

Changes in the amount of carbonate precipitation and
              dissolution have significant effects
on oceanic alkalinity, total CO2, and
              atmospheric CO2, thus climate. Knowledge of the
carbonate depositional history
              is important for understanding the global calcium and
carbon cycles and may
              lead to improved understanding of global biogeochemical cycles
operation on
              Earth on various time scales and the potential feedback mechanisms in
              these
cycles and their effect on climate. The calcium isotope ratio is
              seawater at any given
time is largely controlled by biological precipitation
              of calcium carbonate, a process that
discriminates against heavy isotopes.
              This fractionation causes seawater to be enriched
in heavy calcium relative to
              the average isotopic ratio of input sources to the ocean.
Therefore,
              reconstruction of seawater Ca isotope ratio could lead to an estimate of
              the
fluctuations in the amount of calcium carbonate deposited in the oceans
              through time and
to better understanding of the calcium and carbon cycles.
              Accordingly, the main
objective of this SGER proposal is to explore the
              potential of the mineral barite separated
from deep-sea sediments to trace the
              variations in seawater Ca isotope ratios, and to
evaluate the use this proxy
              for reconstruction of the calcium carbonate deposition history.

This work
              fits the criteria for a SGER proposal as it seeks partial support for
              conducting
preliminary work of an untested and novel idea it is a high risk
              project and applies newly
developed tools (so far only two labs in the USA
              measure Ca isotopes routinely). Results
if encouraging will provide a basis to
              perform further more detailed research that will
advance our understanding of
              the global biogeochemical cycle and its coupling with
climate and contribute
              significantly to the field of paleoceanography and earth history.
