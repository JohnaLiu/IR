Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for the National Conference of Black Physics
              Students (NCBPS), which will be held at Alabama A & M University on March
              13-17, 2002.  This will be the 16th of these national meetings.  NCBPS seeks to
              increase the diversity of the United State community of researchers and
              educators in physics and related fields by providing student participants with
              the motivation and practical skills to further their education and assimilation
              into the scientific and technical professions.  The NCBPS is annually attended
              by approximately 250 students, and is supported by a combination of gifts from
              foundations, national laboratories, industry, federal grants, and support from
              the host institution.  This award will provide direct support for the
              attendance of approximately 50 students.  Also meeting concurrently at A & M is
              the National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP).  This format has proven to be
              highly effective and allows for joint meetings of the two groups, as well as
              separate meetings appropriate to the objectives of each group.
