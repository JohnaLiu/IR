Abstract    :
              This project would study the issues and complexities involved in the
              implementation of six lesson study programs in diverse settings including one
              that is for pre-service teachers.  The goals of the project are 1) to
              understand the implementation progress and challenges at each site; 2) to share
              information about lesson study models, progress and problems; 3) to investigate
              lesson study's impact on teachers and students; 4) to contribute to the basic
              research knowledge on instructional imporvement, professional development and
              systemic change; 5) to contribute to the methods for studying emerging reforms
              and 6) to develop video and print materials for practitioners and policmakers. 
              The primary hypothesis is that lesson study will be adapted by US practitioners
              operatin gin unique local contexts, that the nature of these adaptations will
              influence the development of lesson study.
