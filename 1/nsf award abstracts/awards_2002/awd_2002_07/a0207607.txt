Title: EarthScope Computational Science and
              Information Technology Workshop

This grant is intended to support a workshop
              in the area of Computational Science and Information Technology (CSIT).  The
              purpose of the workshop will be to develop preliminary plans for a CSIT
              component of EarthScope program that will address issues in three areas
              critical to the program's success:  (1) data collection, archiving, and
              distribution, (2) modeling and simulating nonlinear geosystems, and (3)
              advanced information technologies for the EarthScope collaboratory.  A major
              objective will be to cross-educate members of the geoscience and
              computer-science communities in the major research goals and capabilities of
              the two fields, and to discuss how these capabilities can be mobilized to
              enhance the success of the EarthScope program.  The workshop will be open to
              about 70 participants from the geoscience and computer science.  The organizing
              committee will produce a summary of results in the form of a preliminary CSIT
              plan, which will be widely circulated for review  and comment.  A final plan
              will be submitted to the National Science Foundation by August 2002.  The
              workshop is to be jointly supported by NSF and NASA.
