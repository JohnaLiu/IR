Abstract    :
              

The Planning Grant for Infrastructure in Technology, Engineering,
              Mathematics, and Sciences (ITEMS) will enable Lawson State Community College
              (LSCC) to assess the current status of its science, technology, engineering and
              mathematics (STEM) infrastructure; provide the institution the opportunity to
              identify and describe the challenges and barriers to SMET infrastructure
              development; and, develop a plan of action to engage more community college
              students in STEM fields.

This planning grant will lead the way for a more
              focused effort designed to fill
the STEM infrastructure gaps at LSCC and help
              prepare proficient STEM professionals for the current and future workforce.
              Proposed efforts involve partnerships with business and industry.
