Abstract    :
              Funds are provided for a workshop to bring together the leading researchers and
              students on the Isu-Bonin-Marians arc system under the Subduction Factory
              Initiative of the MARGINS Program.  The purpsose of the workshop is to
              coordinate international activities, discuss current and planned research, and
              present previous results.  It will serve as a forum to discuss the remaining
              gaps in the IBM research and where the resources need to be forcused for a
              complete coverage and a successful experiment at this "focus site" of MARGINS. 
              The workshop will be held in Hawaii to allow easier participation by Japanese
              scientists who are important collaborators in the IBM and other experiments in
              the region.
