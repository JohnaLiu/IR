Transport in heterogeneous porous media poses formidable
              challenges to model and predict with good reliability. We propose to develop a
              microscopic physical basis for effective large scale models such as the
              continuous-time random walk (CTRW) method, which takes into account extreme
              fluctuations and anomalous transport paths in the contribution to the large
              scale transport properties. For this, we will use a combination of
              renormalization group and functional renormalization techniques to coarse-grain
              and extrapolate from the microscopic realm to the large-scale description. We
              also propose to generalize the CTRW model to a multi-scale hierarchical
              framework with standard local Poissonian-in-time and Gaussian
              diffusion-in-space describing microscopic processes, to investigate in what
              sense the coexistence of multiple scales is responsible for the effective
              anomalous power law properties, such as non-Gaussian distribution of trapping
              times and of jump sizes captured by the CTRW framework which are usually
              postulated at a phenomenological level.
