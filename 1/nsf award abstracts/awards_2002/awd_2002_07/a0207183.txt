The object of this study is
              to more precisely and accurately characterize the concentrations, in particular
              the relative abundances, of the highly siderophile elements (Au, Re, Os, Ir,
              Ru, Rh, Pt, Pd; elements with very high affinities for iron) in the bulk
              silicate earth. The concentrations of these elements were likely set via
              continued accretion of the earth (0.1 to 0.5% of planetary mass) subsequent to
              the segregation of the metallic core.  Questions we hope to answer are: 1) what
              is the dominant signature of this suite of elements in the bulk silicate earth,
              and can this signature be tied to precursor materials that experienced
              particular nebular or other early solar system processes? 2)  does the upper
              mantle of the Earth exhibit heterogeneities in the relative abundances of these
              elements that cannot be attributed to indigenous processes? and 3) did the
              composition of the late accreted material change with time? To accomplish these
              goals, we will analyze materials from the terrestrial mantle and melt rocks and
              breccias from the surface of the Moon for Os isotope compositions and highly
              siderophile element abundances.
