Abstract    :
              Understanding of orogenesis and its relations to mantle convection and plate
              tectonics relies on integrated studies of the interrelations among processes of
              deformation, metamorphism and magmatism.  A well preserved portion of the
              northern Appalachian orogen is providing an outstanding laboratory for a truly
              integrative study of the evolution of mid-crustal processes that strongly
              influence orogenesis.  This project is employing structural, microstructural,
              petrologic and thermobarometric analyses, and chemical and isotopic dating, to
              temporally and spatially link deformation, metamorphism and magmatism during
              the progressive growth of this orogenic belt.  This information is being used
              to set constraints and boundary conditions on coupled, 3-D thermal/mechanical
              models that, in tandem with the geological observations, are being used used to
              gain insights into the orogen's evolution and associated plate dynamics.
