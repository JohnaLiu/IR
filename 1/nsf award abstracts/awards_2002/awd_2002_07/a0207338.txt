TITLE:  Satellite Reconnect
              Project

This Satellite Reconnect Project is designed to "reconnect" to the
              computer science and mathematics research enterprise, two-year and four-year
              college faculty who have not had opportunities to keep up with new research
              developments.  It aims to reinvigorate their careers and enhance their teaching
              by exposing them to current research topics in computer science and related
              mathematics that are relevant to the undergraduate classroom.  This is being
              accomplished initially through a series of summer conferences at DIMACS, the
              Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science, at Rutgers
              University. As part of the conferences, participants prepare written classroom
              materials based on current research topics and have the opportunity to publish
              them in the DIMACS Educational Modules Series.  Concurrently, the basic program
              conference structure is being replicated at six selected satellite locations
              around the country, generally with different research topics, but under DIMACS
              guidance and leadership.  Through this mechanism, the project aims to establish
              a community of individuals and institutions with expertise in and commitment to
              this type of "Reconnect" project and concept. The satellite activities are
              supplemented with an effort to disseminate the model to the wider community so
              that this type of program can be copied at numerous other locations around the
              country.
