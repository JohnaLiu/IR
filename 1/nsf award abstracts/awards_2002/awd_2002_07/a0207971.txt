Abstract    :
              

Norfolk State University will implement "Science and Technology Academicians
              on the Road to Success" (STARS), a robust program encompassing undergraduate
              recruitment, pre-entrance preparation, advising, mentorship, research, and
              curricula enhancement to address the low graduation rates of students of
              historically underrepresented groups.  Project activities are based on the
              hypothesis that providing students an environment that ties all the components
              of student success into a coherent path with a clear purpose will significantly
              increase success rates in STEM disciplines. 

STARS will first provide
              faculty training on advising, mentoring and teaching and learning best
              practices and opportunities to enhance and/or initiate research endeavors;
              second, it will merge recruitment, pre-entrance preparation, advising, and
              mentorship efforts to create a seamless environment, and third, it will provide
              students superior advising, interdisciplinary research mentoring and exciting
              ways to learn. STARS will provide a coherent undergraduate student experience,
              which will result in a significant increase of the success rate of STEM
              students.

STAR Objectives:
double STEM graduates attending graduate school
              in 5 years;
provide STEM students a seamless environment of recruitment,
              pre-entrance preparation, advising, mentorship, and research;
provide
              experiential learning experiences to 90% of the STEM graduates where students
              develop independent research skills.
implement teaching and learning
              approaches such as: Inquiry Based Learning, Peer Instruction, and Cooperative
              Learning to promote student learning.
