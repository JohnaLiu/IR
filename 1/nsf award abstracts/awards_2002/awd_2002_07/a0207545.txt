Abstract    :
              

This project seeks to investigate State-to-State differences in National
              Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) test items to determine how state
              policies have affected changes in NAEP scores.  The study addresses the problem
              of assessing the contributions of State policies on student achievement.  The
              purpose of the project is to develop empirical measures for the effects on
              student achievement of reform practices.  It would analyze the content of
              individual items to better measure specific aspects of student learning that
              might have been affected by the policies of that State.  Also, they would build
              a mathematical model of the value-added of state policies.
