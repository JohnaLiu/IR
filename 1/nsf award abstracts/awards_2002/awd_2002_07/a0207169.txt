In the proposed research program, we will use x-ray
              absorption spectroscopy (XAS) of natural and laboratory-generated samples to
              determine the importance of metal-bacteria adsorption in affecting the
              distribution of metal in bacteria-water-rock systems. The overall objective of
              the research is to test whether surface complexation modeling can account for
              the observed metal distributions under a range of conditions and complexities.
              Quantifying the effects of bacteria on adsorption reactions in water-rock
              systems has direct applications not only to contaminant transport modeling, but
              also to bioremediation engineering and to the understanding of bacterial
              pathogen mobility. The proposed research will ultimately lead to more accurate
              predictions of the mobility of aqueous metals in contaminated groundwater
              systems.

The proposed research will deliver three things: 1) an
              understanding, provided by both XAS and bulk adsorption measurements, of
              whether bacterial surface adsorption of aqueous metal cations plays an
              important role in metal speciation in bacteria-bearing water-rock systems; 2) a
              rigorous testing of whether surface complexation modeling can account for the
              metal distribution in those systems; and 3) a test of whether natural
              populations of bacteria exhibit identical metal adsorption properties, as was
              suggested by the data of Yee and Fein (2001a,b). The experimental results from
              this research not only will further our understanding of metal-bacteria
              interactions, but they will also significantly improve our ability to
              accurately model the effects of bacterial adsorption on the fate and mobility
              of heavy metals in realistic geologic systems.
