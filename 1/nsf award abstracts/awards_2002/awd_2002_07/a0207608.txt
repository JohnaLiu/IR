The principal objectives of this project are the
              systematic investigation of global seismicity and the three-dimensional mapping
              of the Earth's interior. The earthquake studies are focused around the Harvard
              CMT project. All earthquakes with magnitudes greater than approximately 5.2 are
              analyzed for their source mechanisms using digital data from globally
              distributed seismographs. Unusual seismic phenomena, such as slow earthquakes,
              volcanic collapses, and unidentified seismic signals, are investigated in
              detail. Results are disseminated using electronic mail and the Harvard
              Seismology web page: http://www.seismology.harvard.edu. The imaging of the
              elastic properties of the Earth's interior is pursued by development of new
              data sets and the joint inversion of various existing data sets, such as
              absolute and differential travel times, surface-wave dispersion curves, full
              waveforms, and normal-mode spectra.  Particular consideration is given to the
              inclusion of anisotropy (radial, azimuthal, and general) in the model
              parameterization and inversion.  Models and derived data sets are available on
              the investigators' web site.
