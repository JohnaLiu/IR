Abstract    :
              

Dillard University will develop a strategic plan to guide the systemic
              reform of its science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)
              curriculum with the goal of preparing students for entry and success into the
              STEM workforce. Achievement of this goal will result in increased numbers of
              African-American students pursing advanced degrees, obtaining doctoral degrees,
              and entering the workforce and professoriate in STEM fields. Impacted
              disciplines include biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics,
              and pre-engineering. 

The proposed systemic reform plan includes the
              following objectives: 
- Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities and Threats (SWOT)
              analysis of STEM programs, curricula, instruction, and research practices at
              Dillard University;
- SWOT analysis of current and potential university
              partnerships and programs for student and faculty research collaborations;
-
              SWOT analysis of current intervention and outreach programs that impact STEM
              educational programs;
- Development of an implementation plan for the systemic
              reform of the STEM instructional and research enterprise at Dillard
              University.
