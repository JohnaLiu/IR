The aim of this project is to advance our
              understanding of the geophysics of the Core-mantle boundary (CMB) region
              through examination of small-scale regional variations in shear waves that
              interact with D", the base of the mantle.  Specifically, the investigators will
              look for direct evidence of the foundations of mantle plumes, chemical boundary
              layers, and subducted slabs at the CMB with the increased resolution provided
              by the growing database of broadband array data.  The CMB displays complexity
              and variability unequalled within the sub-lithospheric earth.  As a major
              chemical and thermal boundary layer between the rocky mantle and liquid outer
              core, the CMB likely plays significant roles in the circulation of mass, as
              well as the transfer of heat both within and between the mantle and core.  The
              investigators will specifically address the following questions: 1) Do mantle
              plumes form in D"? 2) Are there laterally discrete chemical boundary layers
              within D"? 3) Do slabs reach the CMB?  One-dimensional models of D" structure
              will be generated using reflectivity synthetics, but final models will also be
              tested with fully 3D synthetics using the spectral-element method of Komatitsch
              and Tromp (2001), which has been installed on Washington University's SGI
              parallel processing machine.
