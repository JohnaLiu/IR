Abstract    :
              This project targets the investigation of middle and secondary school students'
              conceptions of variation and explores how those conceptions develop over time. 
              The investigation proceeds as students explore data sets and sampling problems
              in their mathematics classes.  Likewise, the investigation will shed light on
              teachers' ideas about statistical variation, how those ideas change with
              experience, and how they affect teaching strategies.  Attempts to understand
              teacher knowledge include an investigation of their pedagogical content
              knowledge-that is, knowledge specifically about how statistical variation can
              be taught effectively.  These understandings-of student and teacher
              cognition-will in turn be used to help teachers design their own new approaches
              to teaching statistical variation.  The effectiveness of these teacher-designed
              and research-based approaches will be tested against the performance of
              comparison groups of teachers and students.
