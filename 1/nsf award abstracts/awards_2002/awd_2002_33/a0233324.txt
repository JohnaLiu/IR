Abstract    :
              This project will build a QoIA-aware attack resistant database
system
              framework, call Linba. The trustworthiness of a computing
system in delivering
              valid services in face of attacks has
become a more critical concern than ever
              as people are experiencing
increased cyber security threats. A Quality of
              Information
Assurance (QoIA) service is a service associated with a specific
              level
of trustworthiness. From the viewpoint of end users, the goal of
              trusted
computing is to enable people to get the QoIA services that they
have
              subscribed for even in face of attacks. However, (most) existing
trusted
              systems cannot deliver QoIA services since they have very limited
ability in
              providing (sustained) quantitative trustworthiness guarantees.

The objective
              of this research is to build a new trusted computing
infrastructure that is
              able to continue delivering QoIA services
in face of attacks and cost
              constraints. Based on a novel formal
(service) trustworthiness model,
              Linba
delivers multilevel, differential, quantitative QoIA services
through
              near optimal neuro-fuzzy composite QoIA adaptations where
Linba intelligently
              adapts itself to environment changes and
QoIA-cost tradeoffs are done in an
              optimized way. Successful
development of Linba will arm existing trusted
              database systems
with the ability to deliver QoIA services (in a
              cost-effective
way) and provide very valuable hints on developing a variety of
              other
types of trusted computing systems that can deliver QoIA services.
The
              cost-effectiveness of Linba will be evaluated through
simulation or
              prototyping.
