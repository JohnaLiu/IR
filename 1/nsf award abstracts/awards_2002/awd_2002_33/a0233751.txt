Abstract    :
              This project is a modeling study of processes that control the concentrations of
              oxidants at northern mid and high latitudes over North America.  A suite of
              1-D, regional 3-D, and global 3-D models will be used to analyze airborne
              observations collected during the Tropospheric Ozone Production about the
              Spring Equinox Experiment (TOPSE).  Major scientific issues to be examined
              include:  (1) the altitude and latitude distributions of the springtime O3
              maximum and factors contributing to the variation in the spatial distributions;
              (2) the correlations among O3, NOx, NOy, CO, and hydrocarbons by time and
              latitude and their implications on the origin of the springtime O3 maximum and
              sources of HOx and NOx; (3) the impact of halogen radicals on chemistry in the
              Arctic and vicinity in spring.  These studies will involve assessing the
              relative roles of transport and chemistry in the tropospheric chemistry of this
              region.  Dr. Wang is collaborating with Yongqiang Liu, Georgia Institute of
              Technology, ATM-0000338.
