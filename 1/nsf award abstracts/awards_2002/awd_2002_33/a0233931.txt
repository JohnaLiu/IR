Abstract    :
              Support is provided for the continued operation of a worldwide network of sites
              to view the full solar disk at high-resolution in the H-alpha hydrogen
              resonance line.  Nominally, each of the 5 stations obtains an H-alpha image
              every minute with 1 arcsecond pixel resolution.  These unique observations are
              rapidly communicated to the solar-terrestrial community, and provide critical
              contextual background for the interpretation of satellite data as well as
              material for student education and research activities.  In-house scientific
              investigations to be pursued include, (1) the study of lateral filament
              oscillations, (2) the association of filament eruptions with coronal mass
              ejections, (3) magnetic field characterization through combined analysis of
              H-alpha, Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG), and Michelson Doppler Imager
              (MDI) data, and (4) micro-flare studies through co-ordinated use of Ramaty High
              Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) X-ray observations and H-alpha
              network data.
