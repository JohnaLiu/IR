Abstract    :
              This project is to research and develop a self-assembling system (with an option
              for human remote control) for deploying, storing, docking, and assembling the
              Space Solar Power System (SSPS) in space. The research challenges include the
              design for self-assembling components, the control for a self-assembly process,
              the autonomous docking among components, and the coordination of components'
              actions for precision maneuvers in space. The project will build upon the
              latest technologies from self-reconfigurable modular robotics and develop (1) a
              novel design for building the Intelligent and Reconfigurable Components (IRC)
              for SSPS; (2) the free-flying "intelligent fiber/rope" "match-maker" (FIMER)
              robots with self-reconfigurable and self-adjustable tethering for matching,
              fetching, and docking among IRCs; and (3) a biologically inspired, totally
              distributed control method called the Digital Hormone Model for planning,
              executing, and monitoring the self-assembly process. All IRCs and FIMER robots
              use the same type of docking connectors, and each FIMER robot is a
              self-adjustable string with free-flying heads that can attach to any connectors
              in the system. Using these concepts, the sequence of self-assembly can be
              either pre-programmed in IRCs or remotely controlled by humans. The project
              will also investigate effective and practical solutions for dynamic control in
              micro-gravity environments, and new construction techniques for reducing
              payload for space transportation. All these new technologies will be validated
              on earth by free-flying prototypes generalized from an existing
              self-reconfigurable robotics system called CONRO to perform self-assembly in
              the laboratory, and the results of these experiments will eventually lead to a
              flight-qualified system for testing in space.
