Abstract    :
              Support is provided for the Workshop on Thermal Plasma Characterization on
              October 13-14, 2002, in Minneapolis.  Presentation and discussion of the state
              of the art lead to identification of specific research needs to enable or
              improve the use of thermal plasmas in such application as lighting, circuit
              breakers, coating, cutting and joining, chemical manufacture, and waste
              processing.
