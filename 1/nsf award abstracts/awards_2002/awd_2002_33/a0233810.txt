Heineman
This dissertation enhancement award supports a graduate
              student from William Heineman's lab at the University of Cincinnati during here
              two-month tenure in the lab of Gunther Wittstock in the Department of Chemistry
              at the University of Oldenburg, Germany.  The goal of the research is to
              develop an ultrasensitive and miniaturized immunoassy applicable to clinical
              diagnostics and detection of biowarfare agents.  The goal will be met using
              scanning electrochemical microscopy in to perform and detect the immunoassay. 
              Using microbeads as a mobile solid phase for immounoassay increases the surface
              area to volume ratio, since they can be dispersed without solution, which
              minimizes diffusion distances.  This research could lead to new technologies
              for high-density chip-based testing systems and could benefit in the detection
              of biowarfare agents such as toxins, bacteria, spores, and viruses.

The
              project also has a clear educational objective.  The project will allow a
              graduate student to benefit from performing research in another country.  She
              will develop a heightened appreciation of the world while also learning
              important new technical skills.
