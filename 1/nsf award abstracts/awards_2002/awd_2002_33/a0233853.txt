Abstract    :
              This project will quantify and interpret the dependence of the spatial and
              temporal characteristics of atmospheric flow regimes, focusing on events
              bearing non-gaussian distributions. The work is expected to contribute to the
              understanding of low-frequency atmospheric variability and changes in weather
              extrema, and the sensitivity of such events to small variations in climate
              forcing. A hierarchy of numerical models will be employed, ranging from a
              baroclinic, quasi-geostrophic scheme to a simplified global climate model. This
              novel strategy will be applied to investigate the anthropogenic forcing (such
              as the doubling of carbon dioxide) on regime persistence time via probability
              density functions. 

This project addresses a topic likely to provide useful
              information on extreme weather conditions, and how they impact the climate
              system. It is anticipated that the results will be of interest to forecasting
              the breakdown of persistent regimes, and be relevant to society at large for
              mitigating the effects of unusual weather conditions. Statistical and
              diagnostic tools developed as part of this study will be made available to the
              scientific community.
