This three-year award for US-France collaboration in particle
              science involves researchers and students at Cornell University and the
              University of Rennes.  Michel Louge in the US and Luc Oger in France lead this
              cooperative project on the gravitational flow of grains down inclined surfaces.
               They will investigate the origin and growth of nonlinear granular waves on a
              flat frictional plane.  These waves can lead to intermittent jamming of the
              flow.  Experimental data collected at Cornell will be interpreted using a
              stability analysis of the corresponding hydraulic theory.  This is complemented
              by French expertise in nonlinear stability and "particle-In-Cell" numerical
              analysis.  The second goal is to establish how fully collisional granular flows
              can arise on a bumpy incline.  If they can be sustained, they require
              relatively small angles of inclination.  To study their dynamics, the
              investigators will utilize a granular facility chute at Rennes and interpret
              measurements based on their collisional theories.  

This award represents
              the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the CNRS.  NSF will cover
              travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and his students. The
              CNRS will support visits by French researchers and students to the United
              States.   The project explores fundamental questions in particle science that
              have implications for  industrial processes as diverse as the extraction and
              processing of ores and chemical engineering and geological phenomena like
              rockslides and avalanches.
