This three-year award for US-France-Germany cooperative
              research involves researchers and students at the University of Massachusetts,
              University of Montpellier II, University of Bretagne in France, and the
              University of Bremen in Germany.  Maciej Ciesielski in the US, Bruno Rouzeyre
              and Emmanuel Boutillon in France, and Rolf Drechsler in Germany plan an
              international project to develop new software computer tools.  The objective is
              to develop fundamental techniques in design verification and architectural
              synthesis based on modern data structures, such as decision diagrams.  They
              will explore the application of Taylor Expansion Diagrams (TED) to verification
              designs at the behavioral and register transfer levels (RTL).  They will also
              investigate the application of TEDs to architectural synthesis from algorithmic
              descriptions.  The project takes advantage of complementary expertise in
              architectural and high level synthesis, test, and binary/word-level decision
              diagrams. 

This award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the
              NSF, the CNRS, and the DAAD.   NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses
              for the US investigator and graduate students.  CNRS and DAAD will support
              visits by French and German researchers and graduate students to the United
              States.
