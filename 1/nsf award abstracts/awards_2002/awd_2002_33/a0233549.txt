This
              project studies the propagation of high frequency waves in highly heterogeneous
              media. Radiative transport theory provides an accurate macroscopic description
              of the microscopic
interactions between the propagating waves and the
              rapidly-fluctuating underlying medium. The objectives of the research are
              threefold.  First, extend radiative transport theory to include boundary
              conditions and surface and volume wave interaction. Second, solve the volume
              and surface equations numerically using a Monte Carlo method based on a
              probabilistic representation of radiative transfer with polarization.  Finally,
              assess the domain of validity of radiative transfer by setting up suitable
              inverse problems that allow determination of statistical
parameters
              characterizing the underlying medium from boundary measurements.

A major
              recent success of radiative transport theory is the modeling of the propagation
              of seismic waves in the earth's crust.  Numerical study of seismic wave
              propagation over hundreds of kilometers remains prohibitive with a microscopic
              model, but simulations are now accessible
using radiative transfer theory and
              suitable statistical methods.  Results promise to yield better understanding
              and prediction of earthquakes.  Another application of radiative transport and
              its diffusion approximation is near-infrared spectroscopy.  This novel method
              is increasingly
used in medical imaging for monitoring properties of human
              tissues. Numerical simulation of forward and inverse transport problems remains
              an active field of research. The project provides the mathematical and
              numerical analysis to address these issues.
