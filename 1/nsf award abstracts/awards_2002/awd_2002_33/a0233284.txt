Waste heat transfer and management constitutes one of the
              major issues for devices in space development - -  whether for electronics,
              solar cells, concentrators or other elements.

This project proposes the
              development of a very novel planar micro Loop Heat Pipe (LPH) to accomplish
              this purpose, based upon a potentially revolutionary Coherent Porous Silicon
              (CPS) configuration as the integrated wick.

The LHP provides a circulating
              fluid, which carries away massive heat by virtue of the latent heat of phase
              transformation from liquid to vapor, and the vapor condenses back to liquid at
              the condenser, where it drops the latent heat (to be radiated) . The liquid is
              returned to the surface to be cooled by the all-important wick which serves as
              the "engine" for circulation - - thus requiring no other external power except
              for the waste heat itself.

The wick works by capillary action, and the CPS
              wick is the revolutionary element, where a batch photoelectrochemical process
              has been developed to place many thousands of coherent uniform "worm holes" of
              micron size vertically through an ordinary (100) silicon wafer which when
              oxidized produce wicks of enormous capillary "sucking" pressure. A flat
              (planar) cooling surface results directly. Moreover, silicon is an ultralight
              material. Areas may be made as extensive as needed, with calculated cooling
              capacities of 300 or more W/cm2.
