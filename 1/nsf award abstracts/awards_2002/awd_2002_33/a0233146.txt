This award supports the PI and two postdoctoral students from the
              University of California, Berkeley in a collaboration with Jorg Kudla of the
              Department of Molecular Botany at the University of Ulm, Germany.  The research
              will focus on understanding the signaling pathways that link environmental
              stress factors to cellular responses in higher plants.  These responses are an
              evolutionary development that allow plants to "monitor" potentially harmful
              stress conditions and then change their physiological and developmental
              programs accordingly.  The PI's recent studies have identified a new family of
              doubly ionized Calcium sensor proteins that play a role in plant response to
              stress signals.  One member of that family is probably instrumental in the
              plant response under study.

The combined effort of the US and German groups
              is indispensable to raising the level of research to a new height.  The
              collaboration will also allow for international training of the two US
              postdoctoral students involved in the research.
