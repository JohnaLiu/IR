Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a workshop to define a technology roadmap that will
              enable exploration and sampling under the ice of Lake Vostok in East
              Antarctica. In particular, the goals will be to identify the technological
              barriers to sampling the water and sediment of the lake, and to recommend to
              NSF a technology development plan to overcome these barriers. To achieve these
              goals, the workshop participants will (1) assess the current state-of-the-art
              in underwater exploration capabilities in the context of the science goals for
              future exploration activities; (2) identify critical yet feasible technologies
              that need to be developed in order to enable the science objectives; and (3)
              begin a continuing dialog between the science and technology communities over
              issues of importance to the exploration of subglacial lakes.  This workshop
              will bring together a select group of participants representing the three
              communities of science, underwater technology and planetary
              protection/contamination. The workshop will be structured to include prepared
              presentations (by all three communities), panel discussions and informal
              discussions.  The product of the workshop will be a report documenting the key
              findings of the workshop, and in particular the technology roadmap required to
              enable future science in Lake Vostok and other subglacial lakes.
