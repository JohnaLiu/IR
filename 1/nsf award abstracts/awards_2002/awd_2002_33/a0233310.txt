This two-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in
              photosynthesis involves Marilyn Gunner and graduate students at City College of
              the City University of New York and Pierre Sebban and his students at the
              Center for Molecular Genetics of the French National Center for Scientific
              Research (CNRS).  The objective is to determine protein structure and electron
              transfer in the photosynthetic reaction centers of purple bacteria.  These
              bacteria allow light-activated, single turn-over measurements.  The
              investigators propose to determine barriers to specific molecular changes in
              the protein.  The French team will construct reaction center mutants for study
              of the molecular basis for determining in electron transfer between quinone A
              and quinone B.  The US team will be in charge of low temperature experiments
              and other measurements. 

This award represents the U.S. side of a joint
              proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research
              (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the U.S.
              investigator and research visits for two U.S. graduate students.  The CNRS will
              support the visits of the French researchers to the United States.
