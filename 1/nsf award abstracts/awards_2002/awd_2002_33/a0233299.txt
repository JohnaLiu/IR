This award supports the PI, a junior faculty member, and a
              graduate student from Georgia Tech in a collaboration with Roger Glaeser of the
              Institute for Chemical Technology  at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. 
              The combined efforts of the German and US groups will focus on making better
              predictions of phase behavior of gases, supercritical fluids, and liquids. 
              They will apply the new understanding of phase behavior to the improvement of
              rates and selectivities in heterogeneous catalyzed reactions at elevated
              pressures, especially those involving supercritical fluids.  Many current
              experiments on catalyzed reactions lack information on the number of phases
              present, which phase is present during the reaction, and whether reactions are
              rate or mass-transfer limited.  The present work will delineate both phase
              boundaries and reaction conditions to enable meaningful studies of
              heterogeneous catalyzed reactions at elevated pressures.

The project also
              has an educational objective.  The project will allow the graduate students and
              junior faculty involved to benefit from performing research in another country.
               They will develop a heightened appreciation of the world around them while
              also learning important new technical skills.
