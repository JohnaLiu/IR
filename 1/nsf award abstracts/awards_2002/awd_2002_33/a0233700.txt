Abstract    :
              This project entitled "CAREER:  Immunochemical Techniques for Investigations on
              the Occurrence and Fate of Agrochemicals in the Environment"  is directed by
              Dr.  Diana Aga from the University of Nebraska at Kearney. The project is
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the International
              Programs Office, which will provide funds in support of Dr. Aga's international
              collaboration with Dr. Bertold Hock of the Technical University of Munich.  The
              purpose of this research is to study the presence, disposition and transport of
              agrochemicals in soil and surface water.  Specifically, new methods will be
              developed for the detection of a new herbicide (which currently has no
              detection methods),  metabolites of a known herbicide (which has 8 isomeric
              forms) and for antibiotic residues used widely in feedstocks.  The investigator
              will use known analytical techniques such as immunoassay (ELISA), liquid
              chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS), gas chromatography/mass
              spectrometry (GC/MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and
              capillary electrophoresis (CE).

The CAREER program for young investigators
              focuses on research, as well as, innovative educational activities.  The
              educational component of this research will involve undergraduate research and
              enhanced laboratory curricula which directly impacts the research project.  The
              potential impact of this research on society in a state which has an economy
              based largely on agriculture is significant.  The research could provide more
              rapid and lower cost analyses of soil and water samples used to monitor the
              environment.
