Abstract    :
              The Water Cycle Research (WCR) project will determine watershed scale
              evaporation - a key component of the hydrologic cycle - from a concerted
              strategy involving field observations and numerical simulations of the field
              campaigns. Determination of regional-scale evaporation, particularly, over
              heterogeneous land surfaces remains challenging due to intermittency of the
              turbulent transport. Dr. Parlange, and colleagues, Drs. Meneveau and Thomas
              (all at Johns Hopkins University) will use passive remote sensing tools to
              obtain detailed profiles of temperature and humidity in the boundary layer at
              several nearby locations. The field observations will be simulated using
              state-of-the-art large eddy simulation models, in an effort to extract
              meaningful linkages between surface heterogeneity and mixing in the boundary
              layer region. The project will lead to improved modeling and prediction of
              watershed scale evaporation, with beneficial consequences for characterization
              of regional hydrological variability and change. The project is administered by
              the Large-scale Dynamic Meteorology program.
