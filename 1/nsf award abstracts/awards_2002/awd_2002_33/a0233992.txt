Abstract    :
              This research explores the use of faunal and geochemical proxies to investigate
              the interactions of sea level fluctuations and tectonic processes on the
              Indonesian Seaway and associated effects on the early development of the
              western Pacific warm pool.  The study will use statistical analyses of planktic
              foraminifer populations and isotope measurements on multi-species of planktic
              foraminifers to reconstruct upper water column structure, productivity and
              seasonality for key intervals during the middle to late Miocene (ca 13.5 - 6.0
              Ma).   Mg/Ca measurements on benthic and planktic foraminifers will be used to
              estimate the influences of ice volume and surface water salinity on the oxygen
              isotope record.
