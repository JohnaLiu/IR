This award supports the PI and graduate students from the
              University of Wisconsin-Madison in a collaboration with Mike Rinck of the
              Institute for General Psychology at the Technical University of Dresden,
              Germany.  The combined efforts of the German and US groups will test the
              hypothesis that understanding of language is action based and extends the
              hypothesis to the domain of numerical cognition.  According to the theory,
              words and phrases are indexed to perceptual symbols or actual objects in the
              environment.  Ultimately, understanding language is understanding the actions
              described to the implications for action in the situation described.  Recent
              work has supported the hypothesis for English, and the present work will test
              it for German.  This work has considerable implication for both basic and
              applied research.

The project also has an educational objective.  The
              project will allow the graduate students involved to benefit from performing
              research in another country.  They will develop a heightened appreciation of
              the world around them while also learning important new technical skills.
