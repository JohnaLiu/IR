This award supports the PI and graduate and postdoctoral
              students from the University of California-San Francisco in a collaboration
              with Dieter Wolf of the Institute for Biochemistry at the University of
              Stuttgart, Germany.  The combined efforts of the German and US groups will
              screen a yeast deletion library for mutations that alter proteasomal
              degradation of two enzymes:  fructose-1,6-biophophatase and ornithine
              decarboxylase.  Both are substrates of the proteasome, but differ in the
              initial mechanisms that are used to mark them for degradation.  A detailed
              understanding of the common and distinct cellular functions that control
              degradation of these proteasome substrates will contribute to our understanding
              of a major pathway that controls critical regulatory functions.

The project
              also has an educational objective.  The project will allow the graduate
              students involved to benefit from performing research in another country.  They
              will develop a heightened appreciation of the world around them while also
              learning important new technical skills.
