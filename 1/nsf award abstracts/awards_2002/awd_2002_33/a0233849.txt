This award facilitates collaboration in geophysics
              research between two world class research groups led by Professor Robert
              Liebermann of Stony Brook University and Professor Ian Jackson of the
              Australian National University in Canberra, Australia.  In recent years the two
              groups have separately developed novel experimental techniques for measuring
              the temperature dependence of elastic wave speeds in laboratory prepared
              specimens that accurately represent the minerals of the earth's transition
              zone, 400 to 700 km below the surface.  They plan to use these to study the
              mixed pressure-temperature dependence of wave speeds in fabricated materials
              exposed to similar temperature regimes but very different pressure
              regimes.

The interpretation of seismological models for the earth's interior
              in terms of chemical composition, mineralogy and temperature requires
              laboratory-derived information concerning the elastic wave speeds of the
              relevant minerals and also their pressure and temperature dependence.  This
              collaboration will advance the understanding of these relations through the
              parallel use of various complementary techniques.  The collaboration will also
              provide international experience for several early career/postdoctoral
              scientists and graduate students, including one from a historically black
              university.

Increased knowledge of pressure-temperature dependence will
              improve the inference of chemical composition, mineralogical make-up and
              temperature variations within the earth's mantle
