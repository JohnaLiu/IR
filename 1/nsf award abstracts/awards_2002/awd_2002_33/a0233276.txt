Weller
This award supports Henry Weller, a junior faculty member, and
              two students from Duke University in a collaboration with Andreas Zilges of the
              Department of Nuclear Physics at the University of Darmstadt, Germany.  The
              project will focus on determining the distribution of electric dipole strength
              close to the neutron threshold in nuclei.  This strength has important
              implications for various nucleosynthesis processes.  A combination of
              experiments using the intense white bremsstrahlung beam in Darmstadt and the
              completely linearly polarized monochromatic gamma-ray beam at Duke will allow
              for a systematic determination of the electric dipole strength distributions,
              provide complete decay schemes, and allow for unambiguous parity assignments. 
              The collaboration will provide for the transfer of experimental expertise and
              equipment from the Darmstadt facility, which will help make the Duke facility a
              world-class facility.

The project also has an educational objective.  The
              project will allow the graduate students involved to benefit from performing
              research in another country.  They will develop a heightened appreciation of
              the world around them while also learning important new technical skills.
