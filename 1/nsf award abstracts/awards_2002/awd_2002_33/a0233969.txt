This research will improve methods of analysis for
              large data sets in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) studies, including
              refinements of algorithms for analyzing large maps and removing foreground
              contamination.  The methods will be tested using simulations, and then applied
              to datasets generated by BEAST, an existing balloon-borne telescope for
              measuring CMB anisotropies, and eventually all-sky satellite observations.  
              Extraction of statistics beyond the simple power spectrum, such as
              non-gaussianity and isotropy of the fluctuations, is the main goal of the
              research.
