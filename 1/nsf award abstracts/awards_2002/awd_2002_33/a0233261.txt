This award supports the PI and graduate students from
              Dartmouth College in a collaboration with Asta Richter of the Institute for
              Engineering Physics at the University of Applied Sciences-Wildau, Germany.  The
              German expertise in experimental techniques will be combined with the US
              expertise in computational modeling will combine to enhance understanding of
              the nanoindentation process.  The proposed research focuses on the indenter
              tip-crystal interaction, with particular emphasis on deformation of atomic
              layers and the creation of defects and cracks at the nanoscale level.  The
              computational effort, including simulations, will explore the effect of
              nanoindentation on the surface layers at an atomistic level, looking at
              correlations between experimental parameters and displacement/elastic processes
              at the surface.  The experiments will measure mechanical properties of very
              thin films and composite materials, which will yield quality measures for
              mechanical properties, like hardness and Young's modulus, to classify thin film
              structures on micro-and nanoscales.  The new quality measures are needed to
              characterize nonomaterials.

The project also has an educational objective. 
              The project will allow the graduate students involved to benefit from
              performing research in another country.  They will develop a heightened
              appreciation of the world around them while also learning important new
              technical skills.
