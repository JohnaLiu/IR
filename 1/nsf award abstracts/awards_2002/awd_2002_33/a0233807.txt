Abstract    :
              An International Workshop on Neutrinos and Subterranean Science, NeSS 2002, will
              be held in Washington D.C., 19-21 Sep 02. NeSS 2002 will be a major workshop
              designed to evaluate  and integrate the results of many of the recent
              developments in neutrino, low background and geo-science investigations
              requiring great subterranean depth. The genesis of the workshop is a statement
              found in the fiscal year 2003 budget request for the NSF.
