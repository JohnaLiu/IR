This three-year award for US-France collaboration involves
              researchers and students at Columbia University and the University of Bordeaux.
               Gautum Dasgupta in the US and Jose Braga in France lead this interdisciplinary
              team of mechanical engineers and computer scientists. This research project
              addresses development of optimized computational codes, which can be employed
              in morphometric research in biology and anthropology. The US investigator has
              been developing growth calculation computer programs to yield quantitative
              descriptions of volume and shape change distributions.  He proposes to apply
              these codes in morphometric research in biology and anthropology.  The French
              team brings to this collaboration a focus on fundamental biological and
              anthropological issues and expertise in clinical implications in cranio-facial
              surgery and orthodontic treatments.
 
This award represents the US side of
              parallel proposals to the NSF and the CNRS.  NSF will cover travel funds and
              living expenses for the US investigators and graduate students.  CNRS will
              support visits by French researchers and graduate students to the United
              States.  The project will stimulate more accurate evaluation and efficient
              design of cranio-facial surgery and orthodontic treatments related to
              maxillo-facial structure.
