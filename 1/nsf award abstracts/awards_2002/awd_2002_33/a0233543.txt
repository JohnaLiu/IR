"International Travel Grant: First
              International Symposium on Submarine Mass Movements and Their
              Consequences"

This action is to support a US delegation to the First
              International Symposium on Submarine Mass Movements and Their Consequences. 
              This symposium will be held as part of the 2003 EGS-AGU- EUG joint meeting in
              Nice, France, from 7-11 April 2003.  The objective of this symposium is to
              advance our knowledge of:
 Potentially stable or unstable continental slopes -
              important to the health and safety of offshore and coastal regions;
 The
              possible presence of gas hydrates and free gas zones - so as to improve
              environmental protection during offshore activities such as cable, pipeline
              laying and drilling operations;
 Forces and release mechanisms of slope
              failures on margins, and of endangered areas - for a major contribution to
              sustainable development;
 Establish, describe and develop tools for evaluating
              the consequences of submarine mass movements to the sea floor, man-made
              structures or coastal communities;
 Links between the submarine mass movements
              and the generation of tsunamis.
 Predictive tools and risk assessment of
              continental slope activity for the next 100 - 1000 years.

A US delegation of
              six (6) researchers will participate in the symposium.  Every effort will be
              made to invite junior researchers of the U.S. tsunami community as the members
              of the delegation.
