Abstract    :
              This Water Cycle Research (WCR) project will investigate the causes and
              prediction of summer rainfall variability over the continents.  The focus is on
              coherent patterns of rainfall, which mainly result from organized convection
              and lower boundary forcing.  Dr. Moncrieff and colleagues, Drs. Carbone and
              Davis (also from NCAR), will identify and quantify the predictable components
              of summertime precipitation, and develop numerical techniques for predicting
              both extreme and ordinary events.  The research will rely on a unique six-year
              record (1996-2002) of radar rainfall observations over the continental United
              States.  This data set will be analyzed and simulated using a cloud-system
              resolving model.  The model can explicitly deal with the parameterization
              challenges arising from the organization and scale-separation in convective
              precipitation.  The project will improve the modeling and prediction of the
              coherent rainfall features seen over continental United States during the
              summer season.  The project's broader impacts include the socio-economic
              benefits derived from better hydroclimate forecasts and improved water resource
              management.
