Abstract    :
              The investigator and his graduate research students study correlation and
              sorting problems for finite partially ordered sets and graphs.  Specific goals
              of this research include (1) finding combinatorial arguments for correlation
              inequalities with attention to error estimates and structural information, (2)
              bijective proofs of  log-concavity results and proportional transitivity
              problems, (3) continued investigation of balancing pairs and the cross product
              conjecture, and (4) understanding the boundary effects and the distinction
              between finite and infinite posets in correlation and sorting problems.

A
              major fraction of all scientific and business computing deals with the issue of
              sorting.  Data must be aggregated according to some specified order, such as an
              alphabetical listing or a listing according to social security numbers.  
              Updating records, locating files, and understanding the interplay between
              events which influence the speed at which files can be manipulated are
              fundamentally important research topics where advances will have immediate
              impact on a broad range of applications in business, industry and government. 
              The investigator and his students are studying both the theoretical basis for
              research involving correlation and sorting and the practical implementation of
              algorithms derived from this research.
