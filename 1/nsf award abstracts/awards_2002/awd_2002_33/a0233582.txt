Abstract    :
              Research:

This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is being funded under NSF
              02-2: "Next Generation Chemical and Biological Sensors and Sensing Systems." 
              The objective of the research is to establish proof-of-concept of a novel way
              to monitor, detect, and characterize concealed biological and chemical agents
              that pose threats to people, buildings, mass transportation, urban
              environments, mail/packages, etc.  The method to be studied is non-invasive,
              and allows for real-time, wide-area/field-of-view surveillance.  The technical
              approach is to detect these agents via spatial interferometric imaging of their
              characteristic transmission or reflectivity wavelength spectrum in the
              Terahertz (THz) electro-magnetic radiation range (0.1-3 THz).  Neural network
              analyses of the THz spectra and images will provide the specificity of agent
              detection and reduce the frequency of false alarms.

Impact:

The research
              is to promote homeland security - its impact is thus timely and important.  In
              addition, the institution has a primarily minority student population.
