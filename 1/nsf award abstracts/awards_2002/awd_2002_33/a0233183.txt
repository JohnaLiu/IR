Data will be collected to quantify virus transport in physically
              and geochemically heterogeneous unconsolidated aquifer materials under
              carefully controlled laboratory conditions.  The results will be incorporated
              into a stochastic model of virus transport in aquifers.  The bacteriophage PRD1
              will be radiolabelled and used for this work.  Phage will be introduced into
              glass chromatography columns packed with porous media.  Solution chemistry will
              be altered and fractions collected and analyzed for the phage by plaque assay.
