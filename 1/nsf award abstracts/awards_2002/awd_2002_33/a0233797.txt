Abstract    :
              This grant supports a workshop to be held on October 14-16, 2002, at Georgetown
              University and the National Science Foundation.  This Workshop on Opportunities
              in Materials Theory will focus on scientific areas identified by members of the
              materials theory community as fields in which there is high potential for
              significant progress and impact.  The workshop will highlight some of these
              areas.  Travel stipends will be provided to assist young faculty and
              postdoctoral associates in attending the workshop.  Sessions will also be held,
              particularly for young researchers, on opportunities for funding and on
              proposal preparation and evaluation.  A public lecture is also
              planned.
