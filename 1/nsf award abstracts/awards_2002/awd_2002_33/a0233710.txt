Title: Bayesian methods for
              spatio-temporal, inverse, and multi-resolution problems

Abstract

The
              principal investigator and his collaborators study a new class of spatial
              models derived from the convolution representation of Gaussian process models.
              By expanding the class of distributions for the underlying process being
              convolved, the result is a range of flexible spatial models that are especially
              useful for inverse problems and spatial processes over time. The research
              specifically examines convolutions of Markov random fields and convolutions of
              temporally evolving processes. The researchers also explore the use of coupled
              chains, parallel computing, and surrogate modeling to develop efficient
              computational methods for this computationally intensive modeling
              approach.

Spatio-temporal models have a broad spectrum of applications, and
              the development of more flexible models is a problem of high priority. The
              motivation for the models developed under this project comes from an inverse
              problem in hydrology and a space-time problem from meteorology. The research,
              that addresses both theoretical and methodological aspects in a Bayesian
              framework, will develop models that are useful for dealing with multiple
              scales, a phenomenon encountered in physical processes in both hydrology and
              meteorology.
