Abstract    :
              6th Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference

This award supports
              partially the expenses for participation by 15 graduate students, post-doctoral
              fellows, and young faculty in Sixth Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering
              Conference, which will be held at the Georgetown University Conference Center
              in Washington, DC, on June 25-27, 2002.  The subtitle of this conference is "
              Meeting Global Challenges Through Economic and Environmental Innovations." 
              Like its predecessor conferences, this meeting is organized around the
              Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards and is intended to accelerate the
              adoption of cleaner processes in all sectors of industry.  In addition to
              presentation by award winners, research papers and posters on relevant topics
              are given.  This year's conference is focusing on the role of science and
              technology in addressing such environmental issues as climate change, energy
              and food production, water and resource depletion, and the reduction of toxics
              in the environment.

The NSF support is given to expand exposure and
              participation of young scientists and engineering and thus to contribute to
              education and expansion of research activities in this important environmental
              area.
