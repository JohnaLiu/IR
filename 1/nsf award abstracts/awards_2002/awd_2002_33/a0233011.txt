Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to develop
              high-efficiency, high-quality dense hydrogen separation membranes based on
              nanocomposites of a stable proton conducting ceramic and a metal phase. The
              proposed effort would result in highly conductive, chemically stable and
              mechanical robust membranes for hydrogen separation in high temperature, high
              pressure, and corrosive environments. In Phase I, basic
              composition-processing-microstructure-property relations of the membranes will
              be established through characterization of the microstructure and the
              performance of the membranes.

Ceramic hydrogen separation membranes have
              wide applications in integrated gasification combined cycle and in fuel
              reformer for PEM fuel cells. This technology will benefit the on going efforts
              in increasing hydrogen-to-carbon ratios in transportation fuels, decreasing
              pollute emissions, and use of alternative fuels.
