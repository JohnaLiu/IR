Abstract    :
              This design study will help funded MSP project "pull it all together" and
              reflect on their designs in light of the challenges posed by large-scale reform
              and will help to ensure that the assistance the MSPs receive from multiple
              sources is more coherent. The PIs list key challenges for the MSPs (creating
              and sustaining a shared vision for reform; designing, implementing and
              evaluating reform interventions; and ensure that reforms become
              institutionalized.  This design study will provide assistance to the individual
              sites to help them work effectively with these challenges. The outcome will be
              a web-based Handbook that incorporates the most current thinking approaches to
              meeting these challenges.
