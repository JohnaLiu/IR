This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in
              information technology research involves Boston University and the University
              of Nice at Sophia-Antipolis.  Janusz Konrad and William Karl in the US and
              Michel Barlaud in France lead the team of investigators and students on a joint
              project in video segmentation and subsurface sensing.  They will develop new
              variational methods for segmentation and reconstruction of scenes with dynamic
              objects, with particular attention to temporal event detection by applying
              contour-based representations of the underlying object geometry.  The approach
              builds on the investigators' previous work in dynamic medical imaging, video
              segmentation, and image reconstruction.  The US investigators are known for
              their computational expertise in motion estimation algorithms, motion based
              segmentation, and image reconstruction.  This is complemented by French
              expertise in mathematical methods for image and video processing and coding. 
              The French team is currently pursuing applications using medical data. 

This
              award represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French
              National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds
              and living expenses for the US investigators and graduate students.  The CNRS
              will support the visits of the French researchers and to the United States.  
              US students will benefit from the exchange of scientific techniques and
              experience with an international research team.
