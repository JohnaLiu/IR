Abstract    :
                    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop
              Mobility Agents that help persons with cognitive disabilities use public
              transportation systems and help caregivers customize these agents to serve the
              specific needs of the travelers.  Increasingly, public transportation systems
              are equipped with GPS (Global Positioning System) systems connected to control
              centers through dedicated wireless networks.  Controllers currently use this
              infrastructure to efficiently schedule and optimize operations and avoid
              organizational problems such as bunching.  Agentsheets, Inc.'s investigative
              team will use this existing infrastructure to compute highly personalized
              information and deliver it on PDAs or cell phones to persons with cognitive
              disabilities.  The research will explore user interface issues of agent-based
              real-time interfaces on handheld devices and build a prototype to be tested in
              a real-world setting using the Boulder Colorado bus system as a public
              transportation system test bed
     The proffered technology will develop
              public transportation management tools to provide services for persons with
              cognitive disabilities and for the elderly.
