This three-year award for US-France collaboration in
              chemistry supports annual visits by a US graduate student to France.  The
              project is led by Reginald M. Penner of the University of California at Irvine
              and Frederic Favier of the University of Montpellier 2.  The objectives of the
              research are:  (1)  the synthesis of nanowires composed of two metals; (2) the
              development of methods for attaching receptor molecules to the surface of metal
              nanowires; and (3)  the evaluation of nanowires as chemical sensors. The
              project takes advantage of a method, developed by the French investigator, for
              synthesizing metal nanowires. The US investigator brings to the collaboration
              expertise in electrochemical methods and electrodeposition of nanowires and
              mesoscale particles.  The US graduate student will benefit from training in
              synthetic procedures developed in the French laboratory.

This award
              represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the CNRS.  NSF will
              cover travel funds and living expenses for the US graduate student. The CNRS
              will support visits by French researcher to the United States.
