Abstract    :
              This Water Cycle Research (WCR) project seeks to determine the flux of water
              between various reservoirs, in order to quantify the global water cycle.  The
              quantification is necessary for understanding the physical processes,
              characterization of hydroclimate variability and change, and for evaluation of
              climate models.  Dai and co-PI Trenberth (both at NCAR) will strive to quantify
              the precipitation amounts, intensity and frequency, and evaporation, from
              atmospheric water budgets and fresh water discharges from the continents;
              global streamflow records from over 8000 stations will be analyzed.  The
              results should improve understanding of the fundamental components of the water
              cycle, especially, runoff, river discharge, net surface water fluxes, and
              oceanic freshwater transport.  The effort should lead to improved
              characterization of the interannual and decadal variabilities of the water
              fluxes, and of inter-basin transports.  The PIs expect their efforts to advance
              climate model development since the major model deficiencies are related to
              aspects of the water cycle.  The research should lead to improved modeling and
              prediction of hydroclimate variability and change, on both regional and
              continental scales. 

This work is of potential benefit to the broad
              community of climate scientists studying water cycle science in the context of
              climate change and variability.  Moreover, the information from this research
              will improve climate models and their ability to project future climates, an
              important contribution to societal issues concerned with the environment.
