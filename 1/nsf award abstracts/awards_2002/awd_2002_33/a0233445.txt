Abstract    :
              The proposed project is an empirical study of the effects of MSP projects on
              student achievement, and it includes providing technical assistance to
              approximately 15 MSP evaluators regarding MSP evaluation challenges and the use
              of appropriate analytic tools and techniques for studying the impacts of MSPs.
              The proposed three-year project has three goals:  1) to increase the knowledge
              of MSP evaluators about design, indicators, and conditions needed to
              successfully measure change in student learning over time, 2) to develop useful
              tools for evaluators to attribute outcomes to MSP activities, and 3) to apply
              different techniques for analyzing the relationship between student achievement
              and MSP project activities in order to evaluate the success of MSP projects.
