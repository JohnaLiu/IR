Liebermann

This three-year award for US-France collaboration in
              earth sciences involves Robert Liebermann of the State University of New York
              at Stony Brook, Frederic Bejina and Olivier Jaoul at the University Paul
              Sabatier in Toulouse, France.  The project focuses on the measurement of
              diffusion coefficients in high-pressure minerals, which constitute the
              transition zone of the Earth's interior.  Specifically, the investigators will
              measure silicon diffusion in stishovite and magnesium diffusion in wadsleyite. 
              The measurements of these diffusion coefficients are critical to understanding
              point defect chemistry of high-pressure minerals.  In turn, this will elucidate
              kinetic processes occurring in the deep interior of the Earth.  The US and
              French investigators will conduct diffusion experiments on materials at the
              High Pressure laboratory at Stony Brook.  The materials will then be analyzed
              by nuclear microanalysis techniques using a Van De Graaf accelerator in France.
              

This award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the
              CNRS.  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator.
              The CNRS will support visits by French researchers and students to the United
              States.
