Abstract    :
              The Biodiversity Project is requesting funds to plan a national conference on
              the topic of global biodiversity.  The goal of the conference is to build an
              education agenda for biodiversity that will identify successful programs,
              provide strategies for reaching underserved and underrepresented groups, foster
              collaboration and coordinate financial support for biodiversity across
              agencies. The planning process will yield a conference agenda, a list of
              invitees, a list of potential speakers, goals, themes and activities, as well
              as identification of model projects.  A budget and fundraising plan will also
              be developed.
