Abstract    :
              The design project will develop support for the MSPs to provide high quality
              professional development and to measure the impact of their activities on
              teacher and student learning.  The project will use an "Academy" model and a
              variety of goals including increasing teachers' content and pedagogical content
              knowledge, building a professional community and identifying approaches for
              sustained teacher learning will be pursued.  A variety of approaches will be
              used including the use of case studies, videos, electronic learning, and
              analysis of student work.  Proposers will also develop evaluation and
              assessment tools that the MSPs can use to measure changes in teacher practice
              and student learning.
