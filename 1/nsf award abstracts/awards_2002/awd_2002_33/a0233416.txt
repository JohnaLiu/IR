Abstract    :
              EDC, SRI International, and Policy Studies Associates propose a research and
              technical assistance design study to create conceptual and practical tools that
              will help improve implementation evaluation in selected MSPs. The design
              focuses identifying empirical descriptors of two critical elements in
              large-scale change (1) teachers' instructional practice, and (2) effectiveness
              of coaching/teacher leader strategies aimed at changing teacher practice and/or
              principals' instructional leadership strategies aimed at deepening
              instructional improvement.
