Abstract    :
              Project Impact at Northeastern University and the Eisenhower Regional Alliance
              at TERC propose a design project to create a customized technical assistance
              plan for higher education disciplinary and education faculty that focuses on
              curriculum use along with the professional development models required for
              successful implementation. It is anticipated that these activities will result
              in more effective provision of services by higher education faculty to teachers
              and schools in the MSP projects. It is also anticipated that faculty would
              incorporate the use of STEM materials and professional development modules into
              their preservice teaching.
