Abstract    :
              Under this award, the PI  will convene the third in a series of State of the Arc
              (SOTA) conferences aimed at understanding physical-chemical processes operating
              at subduction zones. The conference will have as its theme, Energy and Mass
              Fluxes in Volcanic Arcs. The meeting will be held in August 2003 at Timberline
              Lodge (Mt. Hood). Rice University will act as the lead institution, and the
              conference will be hosted locally by Portland State University. The meeting
              will bring together approximately 84 international researchers whose work bears
              on the conference theme. Specific focus areas will include: (1) the thermal
              structure of subduction zones, (2) the influence of this structure on release
              of volatiles and possibly melts from subducted slabs, (3) influence of this
              structure on the production and differentiation of magmas at various levels in
              the mantle and crust, (4) geologic, petrologic, geochemical, and geophysical
              constraints on the reservoirs that store and release those magmas and their
              associated fluids, and (5) heat and mass transfer processes and rates in arc
              volcanoes at different spatial and temporal scales, and how these influence
              volcano evolution and behavior. The conference will include a series of pre-,
              mid-, and post-conference field trips to view important aspects of arc
              volcanism as exposed in the Cascades province (Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Hood, and
              central Oregon). These trips will integrate aspects of field geology with the
              conference themes and allow contrast between different styles of arc
              volcanism.
