Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to
              dramatically improve the usability of 
location-aware devices such as mobile
              phones.  Mobile internet devices herald a revolution in personal 
computing,
              but small screen sizes, awkward input capabilities, and poorly designed
              application environments can  limit their potential. BigTribe addresses these
              problems with  a Location Application Platform that incorporates  adaptive
              location-based personalization,  chaining context management and context-based
              applications. The personalization system tracks a user.s behavior and, using a
              new, distributed algorithm, predicts  preferences and adjusts menu selections.
              Chaining context management helps  users  rapidly select venues, such as a
              theater, select activities to perform there, such as purchasing tickets, and
              then .chain. to other nearby activities, such as reserving a table at a nearby
              restaurant. Context-based applications present a natural user interface to find
              and operate on venues, friends or events. These innovations reduce the .clicks.
              users must perform to accomplish tasks. 
     They will improve personal
              efficiency for a broad, price sensitive consumer market (including
              underrepresented populations not reached by Internet advancements), save people
              time, improve social interaction, make planning for meetings more efficient,
              and reduce fuel consumption. This work advances knowledge in personalization
              algorithms, location-based services, context-awareness, and ubiquitous
              computing.
