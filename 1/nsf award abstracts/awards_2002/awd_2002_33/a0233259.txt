Schopf
This award supports William Schopf from the University of
              California-Los Angeles in a collaboration with Wolfgang Heckl of the Center for
              Nanoscience at the University of Munich, Germany.  The project will focus on
              the development of a new paleontological technique that will be useful in
              identification of Precambrian cellular microfossils and their remains.  Through
              the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM), the researchers intend to investigate
              the morphology of microfossils previously located and identified by older
              methods of microscopy, in order to learn about the nanostructure of the fossil
              remains.  The principal investigator on the German side is a pioneer in the
              application of AFM to biological and geobiological problems and will contribute
              unique expertise to the research team.  Results from this work will have a
              definite impact on the current debate over the nature of pre-Cambrian fossils
              and will also be applicable to the study of organic matter from other plants
              and so have a broader impact.
