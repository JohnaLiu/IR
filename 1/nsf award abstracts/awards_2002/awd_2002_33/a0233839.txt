Abstract    :
              This workshop will be conducted to integrate the 9 NMI individual research
              projects awarded last year and 9 more awarded this year.  Since the intent of
              the overall NMI program is to leverage these individual research projects and
              incorporate their work as much as possible, it is essential to conduct a
              workshop with all the NMI PI	s to plan the activities for the second and third
              year of NMI.  This workshop will be conducted on July 16-17, 2002 in Chicago. 
              The purpose of the meeting is to bring together the PIS so that the various
              individual research project activities can be coordinated and integrated with
              the larger NMI program plans.  The proposal includes a draft agenda and list of
              participants.

The workshop has been designed so that NMI PIs have a chance
              to introduce and discuss their research and activities to other researchers and
              the NMI Team.  The NMI PIs will also have the opportunity to modify their
              activities to better support the larger NMI program and leverage other work
              being done by middleware developers.  One of the first tasks will be to define
              how the individual research efforts can be incorporated into the NMI work plan,
              and secondly, to outline a specific work plan and process to integrate the
              software and middleware over the next two years.
