This three-year award for US-France collaboration in materials
              research involves researchers and students at the New Jersey Institute of
              Technology and the Ecole National Superieure de Physique in Grenoble, France. 
              Trevor A. Tyson in the US and Catherine Dubourdieu in France lead the joint
              research effort on studies of structural and transport properties in ultra-thin
              films.  The investigators will explore the effect of high magnetic fields and
              high pressure on transport and local structure.  The principal investigator and
              a graduate student will travel to Grenoble to study French techniques for
              growing thins films.  During their visit to New Jersey, the French group will
              carry out high-pressure measurements (using an optical system) and high field
              local structure measurements. 

This award represents the US side of parallel
              proposals to the NSF and the CNRS.  NSF will cover travel funds and living
              expenses for the US investigator and graduate student.  CNRS will support
              visits by French researchers and graduate students to the United States. The
              research will advance understanding of the structural, electronic and magnetic
              properties of manganite materials.
