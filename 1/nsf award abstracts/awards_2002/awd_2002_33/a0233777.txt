Professor Mubayi plans to undertake research in graph theory with
              emphasis on Ramsey theory, hypergraph coloring, connectivity of cages, and
              graph covering. The main thrust of his project is to study variations of
              problems in Ramsey Theory posed by Paul Erdos. He will also develop the
              coloring theory of mixed hypergraphs, investigate the connectivity properties
              of cages, and study a new problem related to graph covering.

The proposed
              research falls into the general area of combinatorics. One of the goals of
              combinatorics is to find efficient methods to study arrangements of objects.
              These methods are  extremely important to modern communications. For example,
              the design of large  networks, such as those occurring in telephone systems or
              internet providers, deal with finite sets of objects and require combinatorial
              analysis.  Ramsey theory studies the  conditions under which certain
              substructures in a discrete setting are forced to appear. It has applications
              to  efficient information retrieval,  to clear communication  with noisy
              channels, and to the effect of failure of intermediate facilities in a
              communication network.
