Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award is to explore validation
              with the objective of establishing a formal characterization of model validity
              and validation methodology.  Mathematical models are essential to engineering
              design.  There is a concern that model validity and model validation are poorly
              understood.  Neither the engineering design or the decision science literature
              offer a basic theory addressing model validity or validation.  The absence of
              an accessible theory should be of considerable concern to engineers who must
              rely on sophisticated models in the decision making function.

In particular,
              this project seeks to establish a connection between validation and well-known
              results from ergodic theory.
