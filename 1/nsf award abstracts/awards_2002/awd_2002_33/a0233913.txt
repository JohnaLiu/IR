Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas at Austin will
              purchase a High Resolution Mass Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance
              research in a number of areas including a) the design and evaluation of a
              sensor for ascorbic acid; b) analysis of synthetic ligands; c) the synthesis,
              characterization and manipulation of large molecular systems with designed
              structure and function; d) studies involving novel catalytic transformations;
              and e) synthesis of expanded porphyrin systems and related polypyrrolic
              macrocyclic systems. 

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe
              intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast
              array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules.  It is one of the
              fastest growing and most widely used analytical instrumentation techniques. 
              Because of this, it is important for undergraduate and graduate students to be
              exposed to the technique.  Graduate students, undergraduate summer and postdocs
              will use this instrument for their research.
