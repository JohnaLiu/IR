Abstract    :
              The workshop will focus on providing directions for data mining. Specifically
              the focus will be on the following areas:
1.	Data Mining for
              Bioinformatics
2.	Data Mining for Security
3.	Semantic Web and Data
              Mining
4.	Data Mining for Pervasive Computing

Prominent researchers in data
              mining and machine learning as well as government program managers will be
              invited to participate in the workshop. The output will be a report describing
              the areas of future research in data mining.
