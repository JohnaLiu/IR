Abstract    :
              The project will develop and test a balloon payload designed to detect MeV
              electron precipitation into the atmosphere.  Relativistic electron
              precipitation has been found to occur at high latitudes, but it is not known
              how common such events are, nor is much known about the conditions that leads
              to such events.  The instrument to be developed under this project will be a
              very small, light weight device that can include real-time data communications
              via the Iridium satellite system.  This new technology will allow a payload
              that can be launched on small balloons as well as on long-duration balloons.
