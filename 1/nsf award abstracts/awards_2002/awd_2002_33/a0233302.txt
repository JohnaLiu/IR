Abstract    :
              The source of the highly energetic electrons in the out radiation belt has
              remained a mystery.  A model explaining the origin of the electrons through
              inward radial diffusion has been utilized to successfully explain many features
              of the radiation belt but the model requires a source of electrons with a high
              phase space density which must lie outside the radiation belt region.  The
              radial transport model assumes that the first and (usually) the second
              adiabatic invariants are conserved, but the third is not.  This implies that
              electrons must be transported inward from a region of higher phase space
              density.  This project will utilize data from the Polar, Wind, SAMPEX and Los
              Alamos satellites to determine where that source region is and how it varies
              with solar wind conditions.  The radial transport model will then be utilized
              to quantify the electron energization and compare the process with other
              competing processes such as localized heating by waves and recirculation.
