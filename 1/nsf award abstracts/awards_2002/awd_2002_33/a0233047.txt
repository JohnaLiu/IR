Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on the
              separation of light hydrocarbon mixtures by pervaporation. Chemically and
              mechanically robust composite membranes have been made; these membranes showed
              good selectivities and fluxes when tested with propylene/propane mixtures. In
              the proposed project a range of related membranes will be evaluated with three
              target light hydrocarbon mixtures: propylene/propane, n-butane/isobutane and
              toluene/n-octane. These close-boiling mixtures are produced on a very large
              scale in petrochemical plants and refineries and are expensive to separate by
              distillation. Based on the Phase I membrane performance results, a preliminary
              economic and technical analysis will be prepared. The most promising membrane
              and application will be targeted for the focus of the Phase II project and for
              commercialization activities. 

Potential Commercial Applications of the
              research separation of close-boiling light hydrocarbon mixtures, such as
              propylene from propane, is performed on a massive scale in the petrochemical
              and refining industries. Lower-cost, more energy-efficient membrane-based
              separation technology would be widely adopted.
