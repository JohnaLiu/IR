Abstract    :
                  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is Object-Oriented
              Groundwater Data Repository Technology.  Subsurface groundwater systems require
              large-scale models. Credible groundwater modeling needs the assemblage of all
              available information. Currently, the interpreted groundwater data and
              calibrated parameters are stored as input files of a code. All new modeling
              efforts are generally attempted from scratch. This object-oriented data
              repository will systematically store basin data, and will be independent of any
              groundwater code. It will have integrated tools to import, edit, view, and
              export information. It will have capabilities to convert any model data into a
              selected repository format. Integrated tools will provide options to screen
              water level and chemical data for generating good quality datasets for inverse
              parameter estimators.
    Groundwater is the primary water source for millions
              of people, agriculture, and industries. Groundwater modeling is a key
              requirement for (1) groundwater management; (2) permit applications; and (3)
              each waste site EA, RI/FS, risk assessment, and record of decisions (ROD)
              negotiations. Anyone using these data will potentially benefit from the use of
              this data repository.
