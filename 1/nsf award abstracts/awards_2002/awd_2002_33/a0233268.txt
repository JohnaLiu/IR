Abstract    :
              This project is devoted to the study of relationships among the wind field, the
              electrical structure, the microphysics, and the lightning produced by both
              isolated thunderstorms and large systems of convective storms.  It is based on
              the continuing analysis of data collected during the STEPS project of 2000 and
              includes collection of additional data in Oklahoma during the summers of 2003
              and 2004.  The data consist chiefly of balloon soundings of the electric field,
              polarimetric radar observations, and data from a lightning mapping array (LMA).
               Specific questions to be answered are: (1) Are lightning flash rates
              proportional to the mass of graupel in a storm? (2) Does the inverted
              electrical polarity of some storms have a microphusical cause? (3) Do the long
              horizontal flashes observed in mesoscale convective systems originate in the
              region of deep convection or in areas of lighter precipitation? (4) More
              generally, what are the characteristics of lightning flashes in mesoscale
              convective systems, and how are they affected by cloud microphysical structure?
               Answers to the question require synthesis of data from the different observing
              systems and analyzing the data in the light of different theories of charge
              production, separation, and lightning initiation.  Results will contribute not
              only to the understanding of the physics of lightning, but will also be useful
              in developing techniques for assimilating lightning in numerical forecasting
              models and in learning how to use lightning data to warn of storm hazards.  The
              work is done in collaboration with other participants in STEPS, in particular
              New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in the analysis of LMA data and
              Colorado State University in the analysis of polarimetric radar data.
