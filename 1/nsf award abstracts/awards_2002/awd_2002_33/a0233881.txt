Abstract    :
              The project will investigate the structure, behavior, and interactions of the
              waves in the tropical atmosphere, and their impact on convection and rainfall. 
              An improved understanding of wave excitation and governing mechanisms can
              produce more accurate predictions of hydroclimate variability.  Dr. Frank (Penn
              State) will undertake a detailed analysis of tropical waves present in
              satellite data and global reanalysis fields.  He will focus on wave
              interactions with orography and the seasonally and zonally varying
              climatological basic state, in an effort to understand the generation of
              rainfall variability.  Dr. Frank will perform a comprehensive analysis of the
              satellite-derived, 10-year long precipitable water and outgoing longwave
              radiation data sets, which provide unique fingerprints of planetary-scale waves
              in the tropics.  Predictability of wave activity on the 5-50 day timescale will
              also be investigated, using statistical techniques.  The diagnostic research
              will advance understanding of the structure and mechanisms of tropical wave
              activity, and lead to improvements in hydroclimate predictions.
