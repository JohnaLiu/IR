Abstract    :
              This design proposal for technical assistance has three focus areas aimed at
              helping technical assistance providers:  1) identify bodies of research and
              best practices and translate these findings to the specific needs of the MSPs;
              2) work with MSP leaders to use existing and newly collected data about the
              MSPs to inform their decisions; and 3) help create and sustain a national
              capacity and supportive community for the MSPs.
