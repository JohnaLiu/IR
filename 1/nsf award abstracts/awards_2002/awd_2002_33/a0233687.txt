Title: 
              SGER - An Exploratory study into the effect of composite particles and addition
              of nanoparticles on the properties of electrorheological fluids

The main
              goal of the proposed exploratory project is to find a method for substantially
              increasing the yield stress in electrorheological (ER) fluids, removing the
              last obstacle to widespread application of this material to a host of
              mechanically coupled devices with applications in automotive, aircraft,
              architectural and military components.  The approach is based on a systematic
              investigation of the effect of addition of core-shell composite particles and a
              host of nanoparticles of PbTiO3 and other materials with high dielectric
              constant.
