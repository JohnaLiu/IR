Abstract    :
              The proposed design study will create a MSP Network (MSP-NET), a web-based
              interactive electronic community for MSP grantees.  The network will: (1)
              encourage sharing of resources, problems, strategies and solutions to issues;
              (2) connect MSP projects with other resources at NSF and the Department of
              Education; (3) permit interaction within MSP projects; (4) provide MSP projects
              and the program as a whole with a public presence, publicizing the effort, and
              disseminating positive results.
