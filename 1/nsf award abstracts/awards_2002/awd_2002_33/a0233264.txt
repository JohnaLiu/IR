This award supports the PI, co-PI, and graduate students from
              the University of Missouri-St. Louis in a collaboration with Peter Tass of the
              Institute for Medicines at the Research Center Juelich, Germany.  The joint
              research effort will combine theoretical and experimental studies of mechanisms
              of stochastic synchronization and de-synchronization for deep brain stimulation
              therapy of Parkinson's disease by the German group and experimental
              electrophysiological and theoretical modeling of stochastic synchronization and
              phase resetting in electroreceptors of paddlefish by the US group.  The
              specific goal of the collaboration is to understand general mechanisms for
              controlling synchronization in noisy oscillating neurons and to validate the
              effectiveness and neural basis of novel stimulus protocols developed by the
              German group for treating Parkinson's patients by deep brain
              stimulation.

The project also has an educational objective.  The project
              will allow the graduate students involved to benefit from performing research
              in another country.  They will develop a heightened appreciation of the world
              around them while also learning important new technical skills.
