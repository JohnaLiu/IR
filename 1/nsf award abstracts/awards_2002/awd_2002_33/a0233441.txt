This award supports the PI, postdoctoral and graduate students
              from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in a collaboration with Joern
              Wilms of the Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of
              Tuebingen, Germany.  Together, the US and German groups will compare models for
              the x-ray spectra and timing behavior of galactic black holes with
              observational data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer.  Black holes provide
              one of the most extreme environments for high-energy astrophysical processes. 
              Observational data are now showing evidence of broadband spectra and rapid
              high-energy variability, but interpretation in terms of underlying physical
              mechanisms remains difficult.  The current collaboration will combine the
              expertise of the PI's group and that of the German group to provide an
              important link between theory and observations.

The project also has an
              educational objective.  The project will allow the graduate and postdoctoral
              students involved to benefit from performing research in another country.  They
              will develop a heightened appreciation of the world around them while also
              learning important new technical skills.
