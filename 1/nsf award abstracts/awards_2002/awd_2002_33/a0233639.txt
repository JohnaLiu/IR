Abstract    :
              The College District in north central California is engaged in planning for the
              enlargement of its laser optics/photonics program into what will eventually be
              a regional center. Yuba's laser optics/photonics consortium involves industry
              partners Coherent Optics, Inc., and Spectra-Physics, Inc., in close association
              with their representative professional organizations LEOMA and SPIE. This basic
              consortium is building its capacity to serve the industry and the region
              through enhancements to the structure, functions, and size of the consortium
              and through improved curriculum design utilizing a Tech Prep-type
              format.

The planning project covers (1) building the partnership to include
              two universities, three community colleges, six high schools, and approximately
              twenty industrial partners; (2) developing an infrastructure (a committee
              structure, the needs and roles of prospective staff, and the points of contact
              within each participating organization); and (3) developing plans for
              articulation, marketing, data collection/assessment, and staff development. The
              project's second year includes a teacher training component.

The consortium
              has already received grants, equipment gifts, and cash to support the
              Marysville laser optics/photonics center.
