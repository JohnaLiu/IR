Abstract    :
              This collaborative SGER research project brings together two research areas,
              heterarchical organizations and knowledge networks, to investigate coordination
              among the myriad government agencies, civic associations, architectural and
              design firms and academics involved in the redevelopment of Lower Manhatten.
              The project will 1) identify the field of actors and stakeholders
              differentiated by sector, 2) identify and analyze existing ties among actors
              and organizations, 3) analyze existing web sites maintained by the diverse
              actors, 4) map the network of existing web sites to discern coalitions within
              and among sectors, 5) conduct interviews with individual members identified as
              key stakeholders, 6) map existing and potential networks using visual mapping
              tools, 7) trace the shifting boundaries of knowledge networks over time, 8)
              deploy IKNOW, a community-ware web-based tool that makes knowledge networks
              visible to communities of practitioners, so that relevant information and
              insights are available when and where they are needed, and 9) track the use of
              IKNOW by different stakeholders. This investigation will have practical and
              theoretical outcomes. The community participants will benefit from new forms of
              technology to help them better understand "Who knows what?" and "Who knows who
              knows what?" The researchers will benefit from access to an acute and timely
              setting for studying emerging heterarchical structures that involve lateral
              coordination across organizational boundaries with multiple performance
              criteria and diverse evaluative principles to assess what is worthy and
              valuable.
