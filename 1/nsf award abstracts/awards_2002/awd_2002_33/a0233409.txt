Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate
              the viability of a design-focused approach to modeling and simulation that will
              create a unique machining software model applicable to machine shops and
              manufacturing facilities of all sizes. No such tool currently exists or is
              pending.  U.S. shops are continually losing business to foreign sources because
              of price.  They need a dynamic software tool to help them rapidly and
              confidently determine lowest cost machining conditions. This project will focus
              on one  cutter/material system and for extending the science to other cutters,
              materials, and machining systems.  The software will predict cutting tool wear
              for each particular cutter/material pair based upon the iterative interactions
              of over eight different wear phenomena including temperature, force, rigidity
              and friction.  It will account for differing part designs, run quickly on a
              personal computer, and will accurately compute the highly non-linear wear
              characteristics of a cutting tool during its wear history from a new tool with
              a sharp edge to a tool that has reached its wear limit 
     The potential
              commercial benefits will be the ability to predict cutting tool wear and
              relating it to cost and quality for difficult-to-machine alloys.
