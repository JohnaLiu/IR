This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in atomic
              physics involves Mark D. Havey and students at Old Dominion University and
              Robin Kaiser at the Nonlinear Research Institute of Nice. The investigators
              propose to examine coherent radiative transport, with specific attention to
              dynamical effects of atomic motion.  A wide range of phenomena associated with
              coherent radiative transport has already been observed in solids and liquids. 
              But studies in atomic gases have been limited.  In this project the
              investigators will study the influence of coherent transport in thermal atomic
              gas samples and the coherent backscattering effect in a sample of ultracold
              atoms.  These experiments together will explore these regimes for practical
              applications and for fundamental experiments directed toward strong
              localization of light in atomic vapors.  The project takes advantage of French
              expertise in ultracold atoms. 

This award represents the U.S. side of a
              joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific
              Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the U.S.
              investigator and graduate student.  The CNRS will support the visits of the
              French researchers to the United States.   U.S. students will benefit from the
              exchange of scientific techniques and experience with an international research
              team.
