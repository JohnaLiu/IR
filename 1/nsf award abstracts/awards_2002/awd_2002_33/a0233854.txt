Abstract    :
              The objective of this RCN project is to establish an interactive community of
              researchers and students in the area of molecular structure and dynamics of
              macromolecular assemblies, with a specific focus on the forefront technology of
              solid-state NMR.  This project will foster communication of ideas and allow
              exposure to off-campus equipment facilities for six research groups at the City
              University of New York (CUNY), the New York Structural Biology Center, Columbia
              University, and New York University.  The networking will be accomplished
              through an ongoing seminar series held at participating institutes across New
              York City; an annual symposium held alternately at the CUNY Graduate Center and
              at the New York Structural Biology Center; an annual hands-on workshop rotating
              among different laboratories of the core participants; a communications system
              for teleconferencing and video conferencing; and an interactive website that
              will announce the activities described above and allow technical networking
              among the researchers located at the various sites.  

These programs will
              facilitate the ability of both junior and well-established investigators to
              exchange ideas and results, form collaborations in "real time," and advance the
              field of solid-state NMR as it applies to biopolymers and macromolecular
              assemblies.  In addition, the seminars and website will reach a broad array of
              researchers and students who would not otherwise have ready access to
              state-of-the-art NMR methods and experimental results on the molecular
              structure of biological solids.  These individuals include research
              counterparts in locations distant from New York City as well as local faculty
              and students.  Importantly, the Research Coordination Network will include a
              significant population of minority students, who comprise 69% of CUNY's student
              population.
