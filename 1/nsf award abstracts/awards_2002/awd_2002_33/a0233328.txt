This two-year award for US-France collaboration in
              chemistry involves researchers and students at the University of Minnesota and
              the Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Ingenieurs en Arts Chimiques.  Wayne
              Gladfelter in the US, and Constantin Vahlas in France lead this collaboration.
              They will investigate chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes, including
              metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).  These are widely used in
              industry to form films of metals, semiconductors and dielectrics. For example,
              optoelectronic devices such as lasers are produced from trimethylgallium and
              arsine in an MOCVD process.  Recent attempts to improve CVD processes by
              designing new precursors have encountered processing problems.  As the size and
              complexity of the precursor increases, the precursor solidifies at standard
              temperature and pressure. The investigators propose to use fluidized-bed
              technology to solve this problem and will design and construct a fluidized-bed
              solid delivery systems for the chemical vapor deposition of metallic molybdenum
              and zirconium dioxide films. 

The French investigator and his team are
              expert in fluidized-bed technology and have recently used fluidized-bed CVD to
              coat powders with metals.  This is complemented by the US research group's
              experience in synthesizing of molecular precursors for CVD of thin films.  They
              also have completed investigations of the relationship between deposition
              chemistry and film composition and microstructure. 

This award represents
              the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the CNRS.  NSF will cover
              travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and his students. The
              CNRS will support visits by French researchers and students to the United
              States.
