This three-year award for US-France collaboration in
              wireless telecommunications involves students and researchers at Cornell
              University and the French National Institute for Telecommunications.  C.
              Richard Johnson in the US and Phillip Regalia in France lead this cooperative
              project on the theory, design, and pedagogy of broadband telecommunications
              receivers.  As communication systems become sophisticated and hardware advances
              allow for more complex algorithms in telecommunications receivers, these
              systems will become more critical to emerging applications.  The investigators
              will address four topics:  (1) adaptive multi-carrier equalization; (2) ultra
              wideband receivers; (3) turbo equalization; and (4) equalizer initialization
              strategies.  The investigators have complementary expertise in adaptive system
              theory for control, signal processing and communications applications.  Their
              expertise will be used in studies of the interplay of broadband receiver
              subsystems such as synchronization, equalization and coding.   The French
              expertise in joint coding and equalization has potential for adaptation to
              wireless personal area networks under development in the US.  Similarly, US
              expertise in multi-carrier and ultra wideband could be applied to problems of
              inefficient spectral band in local wireless links in Europe.

This award
              represents the US side of joint proposals to the NSF and the French National
              Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living
              expenses for the US investigator and graduate student.  CNRS will support the
              visits of the French researchers and graduate students to the United States.
