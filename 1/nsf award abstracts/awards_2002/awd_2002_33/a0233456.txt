Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks to develop and validate  measures of teacher's knowledge of
              mathematics.   The proposal has three parts.  In the first part,  the
              researchers will develop new measures of teachers' knowledge of upper
              elementary and middle-grade algebra, geometry and teachers' ability to
              interpret student thinking in algebra.  In the second part, they will validate
              existing measures of mathematics knowledge for teaching by conducting
              interviews and observing teachers, mathematicians and non-teaching
              professionals. In the third part, they will develop a strategy for supporting
              MSPs in the use of these instruments.
