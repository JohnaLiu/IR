This two-year award for US-France collaboration in materials
              engineering involves researchers at Cornell University and the Ecole Centrale
              de Nantes.  Natarajan Sukumar in the US and Nicolas Moes in France lead this
              cooperative project to develop a three-dimensional computational model for
              non-planar crack growth.   Crack growth is a complex multi-physics phenomena in
              which global macroscopic material behavior and local microscopic features play
              a role in the failure process.  The development of robust computer simulation
              tools for crack growth can lead to a better understanding of the dominant modes
              of failure and provide improvements in designing stronger and tougher
              materials, such as alloys.  In developing a model simulation, the US and French
              investigators propose to use the computational method known as the extended
              finite based element technique.  In this collaboration, the French investigator
              provides expertise in data structures, domain integrals and components of the
              code that will facilitate the development of the crack growth model. 

This
              award provides travel funds and living expenses for one-month visits to France
              by the US investigators.
