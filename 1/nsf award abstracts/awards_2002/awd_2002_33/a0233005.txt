Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the skill
              gap that
exists within the software development community in the production of
              work-centered
software. To this end, Stottler Henke will develop a novel
              software development
environment that reduces the complexity of interaction
              design &#8211; bridging the gap
between the analysis of the work domain and
              the development of well-designed supporting
software. The proposed WorkWell
              system will provide for an enhanced Contextual Design
process with tools that
              enable software developers to draw on the aggregate experience of
other
              work-centered application designers. This will be achieved through the
              application
of proven design/interaction patterns that will, for instance,
              enable software developers
to resolve the conflicts between the desire for
              automation and user&#8217;s need for a
feeling of control. Further, WorkWell
              will support an incremental process for mapping the
semantics of user goals to
              underlying software functionality and the user interface
design. Phase I will
              result in a limited prototype that will demonstrate the feasibility
of the
              proposed approach. The results of these efforts will have a great impact
              on
society &#8211; furthering the understanding of work-centered design and
              enabling
corporations to produce software that will enjoy higher user adoption
              rates and improve
efficiency.
There is a large market for tools that can
              improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
software development efforts. The
              WorkWell system offers corporations the means to
produce intuitive and
              effective software under the time and resource limitations that
exist in the
              commercial world and thereby achieve much higher user adoption rates for
their
              products.
