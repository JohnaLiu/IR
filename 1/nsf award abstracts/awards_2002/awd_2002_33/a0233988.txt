Psaltis
This award supports Demetri Psaltis and two students from the
              California Institute of Technology in a collaboration with Karsten Buse of the
              Department of Physics at the University of Bonn, Germany.  The project will
              focus on the study of volume holographic recording in photorefractive crystals.
               The major problem up to now has been that the holographic data gets erased
              during read out, making it unsuitable for storage devices.  A solution to the
              problem lies in the use of doubly doped crystals, and this collaboration will
              optimize the materials, which could be used to make rewritable storage devices.
               Together the two groups will model the physical mechanisms responsible for the
              success of the method, improve the performance of the method by testing other
              dopants and crystals, and demonstrate a persistent holographic memory system
              incorporating doubly doped crystals.

The project also has an educational
              objective.  The project will allow the graduate students involved to benefit
              from performing research in another country.  They will develop a heightened
              appreciation of the world around them while also learning important new
              technical skills.
