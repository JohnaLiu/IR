This award supports Sandra Hanson and a junior faculty member
              from Catholic University in a collaboration with Stefan Fuchs of the Department
              of 
Sociology at the University of Munich, Germany.  The project will analyze
              differences in attitudes about opportunity, status, and inequality among women
              in science and technology occupations in the former East Germany, West Germany,
              and the US.  It will also compare attitudes of female scientists with
              non-scientists and male scientists.  Changes over time in women scientists'
              attitudes will also be considered.  One hypothesis is that the experiences of
              women scientists in the former East Germany will result in a very different set
              of ideas about what it takes to get ahead, about their own socio-economic
              position and mobility, and about reasons for inequality than will be found
              among from West Germany and the US.  Examination of mobility-related attitudes
              in an important area of social mobility research since those attitudes provide
              insight into the relation between the structure of political and socio-economic
              systems and the structure of mobility attitudes at the individual and country
              levels.

The project also has an educational objective.  The project will
              allow a junior faculty member to benefit from performing research in another
              country.  She will develop a heightened appreciation of the world while also
              learning important new technical skills.
