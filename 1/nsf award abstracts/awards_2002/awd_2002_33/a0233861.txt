Abstract    :
              This project supports a workshop that is designed to reach out to a broad
              scientific community of aerosol scientists on issues associated with
              carbonaceous aerosols in the atmosphere.  Considerable controversy exists among
              aerosol scientists regarding terminology and methodology for measuring and
              reporting carbonaceous fractions of atmospheric aerosol.  This workshop will
              help to develop a consensus on terminology for carbonaceous aerosol (e.g. the
              definition of black carbon), address carbon aerosol sampling difficulties, and
              recommend standardized analysis for carbonaceous aerosol for the purposes of
              sample intercomparison between field campaigns and longer-term measurement
              sites.
