Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Carol Espy-Wilson will study a
              knowledge-based speech recognition system's performance in noise. The research
              is linguistically motivated way, in that it seeks acoustic correlates of
              linguistic features. This project emphasizes two components of the PI's larger
              research agenda: (1) analysis of signal representation to ensure its
              robustness, and (2) application of a neural model to enhance the
              signal-to-noise ratio before or during the extraction of a knowledge-based
              speech signal representation. The broader impacts of the project lie in its
              progress towards speaker-independent speech recognition, which has practical
              applications in industry, education and speech rehabilitation.
