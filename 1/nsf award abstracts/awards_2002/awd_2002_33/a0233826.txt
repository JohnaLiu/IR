Abstract    :
              This POWRE award by the Chemistry Division will support Dr. Nicole Bennett in
              developing a research program in efficient organo-metallic synthesis at Hope
              College. The specific objective of this research will be to develop little used
              synthetic procedures to prepare taxane diterpenes, a class of compounds that
              have found use as anticancer agents. This project will allow Dr. Bennett to
              expand the repertory of undergraduate research projects at Hope, especially in
              the areas of synthetic organometallic chemistry, stereochemistry and structure
              interpretation by magnetic resonance. The project will also support Dr.
              Bennett's efforts to incorporate modern synthetic chemical techniques in the
              undergraduate chemistry curriculum at Hope College and will provide chemistry
              undergraduates at the college with experience in specialized synthetic chemical
              procedures, advanced chemical structural concepts, use of the chemical
              literature, presentation of research results, etc. that will better prepare
              them for graduate training in the field.
