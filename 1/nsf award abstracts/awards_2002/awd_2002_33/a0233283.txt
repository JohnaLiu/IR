This three-year award for US-France collaboration in materials
              research involves researchers and students at the Cornell University and the
              University of Aix-Marseilles.  Shefford P. Baker in the US and Olivier Thomas
              in France lead this collaboration. They will investigate stress distribution in
              nanofabricated metal structures.  They will also determine the effects on
              mechanical behavior and reliability. This work will be accomplished by a
              combination of high-resolution x-ray diffraction experiments at the Cornell
              High Energy Synchrotron Source.  Samples will include model single and
              bi-crystal thin film systems, polycrystalline films, and nanofabricated line
              arrays. The French investigators will focus on x-ray data analysis and modeling
              of x-ray spectra and the US investigators will contribute sample preparation
              and mechanical modeling.  Both groups will participate in the design and
              execution of x-ray measurements at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source.
              Research on metal films and nanostructures at the 10-1000 nanometers play
              critical roles in virtually all nanofabricated devices. The result of this
              collaboration will advance understanding of the mechanical behavior of thin
              metal films and nanopatterned structures, which will be of value in industries
              that rely on nanofabrication.

This award represents the US side of parallel
              proposals to the NSF and the CNRS.  NSF will cover travel funds and living
              expenses for the US investigator and his students. The CNRS will support visits
              by French researchers and students to the United States.
