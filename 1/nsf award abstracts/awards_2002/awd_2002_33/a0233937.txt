Abstract    :
              The project will determine whether it will be possible to obtain information
              from small businesses engaged in design and manufacture of high-end apparel in
              developed countries.  The PI seeks to explore novel and effective supply chain
              arrangements that some small companies have found to be viable.  In today's
              economy, off-shore manufacture is the primary means of viable apparel
              manufacturing, and requires far more capital than is generally available to
              small businesses.  If the needed information can be obtained through interviews
              with  company presidents, a more comprehensive study will be undertaken.  This
              project may open up new ways for small domestic apparel designers/manufacturers
              to survive in today's global economy.
