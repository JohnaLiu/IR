Abstract    :
              The project will undertake laboratory reactor experiments that seek to recreate
              the photochemistry of the upper atmosphere in order to solve existing dilemmas
              regarding the modeling and understanding of recent and new atmospheric
              measurements.  Although lower pressures and longer times pertain to the real
              atmosphere, computer modeling we can be used to design the virtual atmosphere
              experiments so that they are sensitive to the same chemistry and photolysis. 
              The chemistry of the upper stratosphere and mesosphere to be explored by the
              study is dominated by reactive oxygen- and hydrogen-containing species, many of
              which we will measure with great sensitivity and selectivity using a series of
              laser diagnostics.  This concept will provide a new technique to validate our
              understanding of the photochemistry of hard-to-access regions and uncover any
              unknown features.  The experiments will be conducted in a large reactor bulb
              with quantified inlet and outlet flows of oxygen, nitrogen, ozone, and water,
              operating near 1 torr with 3- to 6-minute residence times, and subject to
              ultraviolet photolysis with well-characterized lamp or laser radiation.  The
              appropriate operating conditions and diagnostics will be combined to address
              specific topics of current interest, debate, or measurement activity, including
              the failure of current mesospheric models to predict observed OH and HO2
              levels, and the role of excited oxygen and hydroxyl states in the heating,
              signatures, and chemistry of the upper atmosphere.
