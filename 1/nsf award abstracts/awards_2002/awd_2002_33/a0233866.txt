Description: This project supports a US-Egypt Workshop on
              Research in Anthropology to be held in Cairo, Egypt, February 2003.  The
              organizers are Dr. Fred Wendorf, Department of Anthropology, Southern
              Methodists University, Dallas, Texas and Dr. Dr. Azza Mohamed Sarry El-Din,
              National Research Center (NRC), Cairo, Egypt.  The workshop is to exchange
              information between the US and Egyptian sides on: 1) specific topics in
              anthropological archeology including: cultural heritage management, exploration
              of the Nile floodplain, desert survey, desert-valley interaction, national
              archeological map, relationship between landscape culture and society, environs
              of Egyptian temples, 2) topics in physical anthropology and human paleontology
              including: early primates, paleopathology, prehistoric and early historic
              population characteristics, human genetics, including DNA studies of ancient
              and modern populations and populations history and migration, physical effects
              of urban environments in Egypt, and demographic and epidemiological
              transitions.

Scope: This project enables US and Egyptian scientists to
              participate in a workshop to discuss an area scientific importance to
              scientists and officials in both countries and to identify potential
              collaborative research where the two sides can complement each other's
              capabilities.  Dr. Wendorf has successfully conducted research in Egypt in this
              field for several years.  The NRC has a group that does considerable
              anthropological research in Egypt, and has the facilities to manage the
              workshop and to promote the resulting joint collaborative research. This
              project is being partially supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program,
              which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry
              out these joint scientific activities.  Additional funding is provided by the
              Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences.
