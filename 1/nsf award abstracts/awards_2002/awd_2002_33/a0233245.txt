Abstract    :
              The Water Cycle Research (WCR) project will develop a continuous thunderstorm
              monitoring system over the African continent for characterization of convective
              precipitation variability at spatial resolutions needed for hydroclimate
              studies and applications.  In the absence of ground weather radar and reliable
              surface measurements of precipitation over vast regions of Africa, space
              observations provide a valuable, unique means of monitoring rainfall
              variability.  Dr. Anagnostou (U Conn) and co-PI Dr. Williams (MIT) will extend
              the lightning based monitoring system that is operative over Europe, West Asia,
              and the Atlantic Ocean to the African continent, from deployment of
              sferics-based radio receivers at four African sites.  Cloud-to-ground lightning
              events will be retrieved in real time, and combined with satellite infrared and
              microwave observations to monitor convective precipitation and thunderstorm
              rain-rates.  The fully implemented system will provide reliable, real-time data
              for hydro-meteorological forecasting and water resource management, with
              considerable socio-economic benefits to the African people.
