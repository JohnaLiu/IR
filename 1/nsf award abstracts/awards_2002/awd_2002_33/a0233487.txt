Abstract    :
              This proposal from George Washington University and its partner, the Potomac 
              Communication Group, is aimed at designing a system to develop the capacity of
              the MSPs to use, generate and disseminate knowledge about educational
              improvement.  The goals are to identify promising dissemination practices,
              identify what knowledge decision -makers need , and develop a preliminary
              framework for the dissemination of activities and findings of the MSPs.   There
              are five research questions:  1) What are the information needs of key
              education decision-makers?  2) What contextual factors influence or motivate
              the use of knowledge in decision making? 3) What are the information pathways
              used by the decision-makers to access information? 4) What barriers or
              motivating factors are present in accessing and using the knowledge  to
              transform STEM education? 5) What knowledge dissemination strategies or
              combination of strategies stimulate reform of STEM education?
