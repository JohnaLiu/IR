Abstract    :
              The objective of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project is to
              determine whether a general theory of validation of engineering models can be
              created.  Much of engineering design is based on the validity of the design of
              an artifact.  Indeed, this faith in the validity of a model extends even to
              national policy when tests - such as conducting nuclear explosions - are
              replaced by studying consequences coming from models.  But, do the models do
              what they predict?
