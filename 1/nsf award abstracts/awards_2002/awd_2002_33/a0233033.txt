Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will aid,
              support, and encourage eLearning students and instructors to find the best
              matches for their purposes in each other's skills, and to find the best
              knowledge and program resources to suit their immediate, particular needs.  The
              software automatically extracts taxonomies from textual materials, which then
              allows those materials to be cross-referenced automatically.  Taxonomize thus
              will provide extensible and low-cost eLearning support software, which is based
              on knowledge management (KM) capabilities, rather than attaching KM as an added
              feature.  For example, an advanced auto-categorization engine will provide
              content management to help students find the best resources of tutors and
              workgroups to match their immediate needs.

Current customers are colleges
              seeking economical ways to meet increasing demands for a popular international
              tutoring program.  The research program, "PerK," will enable this expansion at
              costs far below current market.  Ultimately the goal is to disseminate PerK
              capabilities into the full eLearning market, with target functionality and at
              lower cost than other current eLearning providers.
