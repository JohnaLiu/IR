Abstract    :
              This five-year award continues the operation of the Millstone Hill Observatory
              in conjunction with scientific investigations of the upper atmosphere and
              ionosphere.  The Millstone Hill Observatory is part of the Haystack
              Observatory, located near Westford, Massachusetts.  The observatory is situated
              at a magnetic latitude of 55 degrees, such that its extensive field of view for
              ionospheric observations encompasses the full extent of mid-latitude,
              sub-auroral, and auroral features and processes.  The radar is operated about
              1000 hours per year in support of several community-driven science programs, as
              well as individual investigator requests.  The research emphasis of the
              observatory staff includes a broad range of topics involving processes and
              dynamics of the thermosphere, ionosphere, and magnetosphere, along with
              investigations of plasma waves and magnetic storm effects.  In addition to
              scientific research, the staff supports outside users by developing means for
              efficient access to the observed and analyzed parameters via the World Wide
              Web.  Web access is also used for scheduling usage of the instruments,
              coordinating community-interaction workshops, and disseminating education and
              outreach materials.  Broader impacts of the Millstone Hill program include
              mentoring of undergraduate students, scientific contributions to space weather
              and global change forecasting, and dissemination of data for scientific and
              educational use.
