Abstract    :
              The field of Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) has developed significantly over
              the fast 15 years. The ability to make a part quickly with minimal imitations
              on geometric shape has spawned applications in the fields of transportation,
              medicine, the military, microelectronics, and others.  With this growth has
              developed the need for researchers to meet to discuss fundamental and
              developmental issues of SFF.  The annual SFF Symposium was first held in 1990
              to provide a forum for technical exchange of all aspects of SFF:  materials,
              process development, physical and computational modeling, and applications.  It
              is the oldest continuous meeting in the area and is reputed to be one of the
              top research meetings in the world.

From the beginning, the philosophy of
              the SFF Symposium Organizing Committee of student involvement has been crucial
              to the success of the meeting and the field.  Student involvement is encouraged
              by offering a student registration rate that is approximately one-third of the
              regular rate and which for the last several years have in fact been below the
              per capita break-even cost.  This subsidy has been effective in attracting
              students.  In 2001, approximately 32% of the entire meeting was students.  
              Participants represented 38 universities (13 international universities).  The
              interaction with the scientific leaders of the field is beneficial to these
              young scientists and represents an investment in the future of the US
              scientific infrastructure.
