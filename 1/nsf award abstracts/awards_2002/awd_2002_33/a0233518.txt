Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of anionic and photochemical
              condensation reactions. When combined with anionic fragmentation reactions,
              these transformations will produce highly functionalized 5-10 membered ring
              systems including those present in the biologically active cembranoid natural
              products.  The educational component of the project includes K-12 science
              outreach and curriculum development at the undergraduate level.  At the
              graduate level, future educators will be introduced to ways of describing
              chemical research in layman's terms. 

With this award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational
              efforts of Dr. Jon D. Rainier of the Department of Chemistry at the University
              of Arizona.  Professor Rainier will focus his research on the development of
              synthetic methodology applicable to the preparation of complex molecules with
              important biological properties.  Dr. Rainier's educational activities include
              outreach efforts and curriculum development at the undergraduate level.
