Abstract    :
                    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will assess the
              technical and commercial feasibility of SoftPDA, a wireless software platform
              for enterprise applications. The platform is focused on modeling business
              processes and automating business critical tasks for wireless device users. As
              a result of this approach, the platform addresses some of the well-known
              deficiencies of wireless devices. Such
deficiencies have made wireless devices
              clumsy or inappropriate for compute-intensive tasks. The result of this
              research will be detailed design of that platform along with the algorithms
              necessary to enable it. 
     The results of have applicability to a wide base
              of mobile professionals utilizing wireless devices to conduct business,
              including sales personnel, executives, consultant, attorneys, and finanical
              personnel engaged in any business enterprise.  The results are also relevant to
              mobile workers in vertical markets such as field service and medicine.
