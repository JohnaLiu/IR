Abstract    :
              This  Small  Business  Innovation  Research  (SBIR) Phase  I  project  seeks  to
               develop  and  commercialize  novel monodisperse ceramic membranes and
              membrane-reactors. Our innovation is based on self-organized anodic alumina
              with precisely engineered porous structure and previously unattainable  pore 
              size (down to
1 nm  or less),  greatly  enhanced chemical  and  thermal 
              stability,  and  superb  mechanical properties. Commercially available anodic
              alumina membranes have limited practical  application  due  to  their 
              fragility,  susceptibility  to  acid  and  base  attack,  as  well  as  the 
              lack  of  membranes with pore size smaller than 100 nm for symmetrical
              membranes. The proposed approach  addresses  these  limitations  by  combining 
              innovative  synthesis  of  highly  ordered  nanoporous  anodic  alumina  with 
              symmetrical  porosity,  conversion  of  anodic  alumina  into  polycrystalline 
              ceramic  while  preserving  its  morphology,  and  conformal  deposition  of 
              functional  layers.    The  proposed technology will enable the fine-tuning of
              the pore diameter in the ranges from below 1  nm to 200 nm. Deposition of
              materials inside the nanopores will afford desired functionality. 

The
              membranes will target selected applications, such as fuel cell reformers sized
              for Next Generation Vehicles, integrated mesoscopic power sources for
              micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), as well as future portable energy
              sources.
