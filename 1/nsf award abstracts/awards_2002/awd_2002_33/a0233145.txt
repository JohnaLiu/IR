This award supports the PI and postdoctoral students from Emory
              University in a collaboration with Inga Neumann of the Institute for Zoology at
              the University of Regensburg, Germany.  The combined efforts of the German and
              US groups will focus on their shared interest in the role of the neuropeptides
              oxytocin and vasopressin in the regulation of social behavior and stress
              coping.  The US group at the NSF Center for Behavioral Neuroscience focuses on
              the role of oxytocin and vasopressin in social attachment of the monogamous
              rodent species the prairie vole.  Studies suggest that oxytocin and vasopressin
              are released in the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum during mating, which
              trigger the pair bond formation.  There is, however, no direct evidence of
              peptide release during mating in the monogamous voles.  This issue will be
              addressed in the collaboration using in vivo microdialysis and sensitive
              radioimmunoassay.  The German group is the only one in the world to have
              successfully measured oxytocin and vasopressin release in behaving
              rodents.

The project also has an educational objective.  The project will
              allow the postdoctoral students involved to benefit from performing research in
              another country.  They will develop a heightened appreciation of the world
              around them while also learning important new technical skills.
