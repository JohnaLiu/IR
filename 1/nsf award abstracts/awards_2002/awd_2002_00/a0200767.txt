Leonard, Godoy, McDade
	This pilot research by three anthropologists
              will study subjective and objective quality-of-life in an indigenous population
              of lowland Bolivia (the Tsimane') undergoing rapid lifestyle change. The
              researchers will develop and field-test new measures of quality-of-life in
              order to ultimately test hypotheses about the effects of economic development. 
              They intend to collect primary information from a sample of people; to collect
              repeated observations from the same people and communities to control for fixed
              attributes; and to evaluate a broad range of explanatory variables relating to
              economic success, nutritional status, and stress. 
This research will be
              significant in its theoretical advance in estimating how inequalities affect
              quality of life.  It will advance the methodology of eliciting information from
              people about their subjective state of happiness, and in its broader aspects,
              will contribute to a more informed discussion and a new way of thinking about
              he degree to which economic development, integration to a market economy, trade
              opening or globalization hurts or helps traditional people.
