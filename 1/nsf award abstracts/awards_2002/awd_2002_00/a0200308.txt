Abstract    :
              This research will develop new lift-and-project methods for 0-1 mixed-integer
              programming.  These methods will encompass two classes of techniques.  The
              research team will consider lifting an n-dimensional point to a zeta-vector of
              the subset algebra of the n-dimensional hypercube, thereby extending the
              Lovasz-Schrijver, Sherali-Adams, Lasserre methods, as well as the disjunctive
              programming ('lift and project') method of Balas, Ceria and Cornuejols.  Such a
              lifting appears promising in that it produces higher-dimensional objects
              "faster" than the previously mentioned methods.   The second class of
              techniques will consider successively refining a disjunction to generate deeper
              cutting planes.

Integer programming embodies the systematic solution of
              planning problems arising in numerous practical settings, e.g. transportation,
              logistics, supply chain, finance, power generation and others.  Such problems
              are inherently non-continuous:  they involve the allocation of discrete units
              of resources.  As such, they are extremely intractable.  At the same time,
              accurate solutions translate into substantial savings, and thus there is a need
              for effective solution methodologies.  The impact of this research will be to
              broaden the class of problems that can be successfully tackled, using
              innovative techniques.
