Abstract    :
              While some researchers have aimed at efficiency, they have often developed
              algorithms without proving them secure. Conversely, researchers focussed on
              provable security have often produced impractical algorithms. Providing both
              performance and provable security entails great effort in each domain, often
              entailing a strange marriage of mathematics with implementation
              considerations.
It is not unusual for researchers to be seeking a generator of
              a random cyclic group while at the same time worrying about whether finding one
              will cost too many machine cycles. This research effort aims to address these
              problems by developing cryptographic algorithms that are vigorously optimized,
              yet retain proven security. Moreover, for each algorithm a carefully-tested
              implementation will be provided, along with a specification for porting to
              other platforms. Finally, the most promising algorithms will be forwarded to
              standards activities in order to make them widely available. The planned
              results are to provide the user community with fast, secure algorithms with
              freely-available reference code; to encourage other researchers to expend
              efforts in these directions when publishing new protocols, and to introduce
              students to the cross-disciplinary nature of this research, which blends pure
              mathematics with architectural considerations.
