Abstract    :
              From 1969 through 1981 the National Science foundation awarded seven grants to
              Dr. Anthony Marks to conduct archaeological research in the Israeli Central
              Negev Desert. A number of important open air sites were excavated and the
              results published in a multi-volume series. The sites are important because
              they document the transitional period which led to the emergence of
              anatomically modern humans and the appearance of a modern range of fundamental
              behaviors. Following accepted standards of the time, the collections were
              divided between the Israel Antiquities Authority in Jerusalem and Southern
              Methodist University (SMU), Dr. Marks' home institution. Such a practice is no
              longer followed because of the difficulty it imposes on researchers who wish to
              study an entire collection. Dr. Marks is now retiring from SMU and the
              institution no longer wishes to maintain either his or others' Old World
              archaeological collections. With NSF support, Dr. Marks and a student will
              systematize and pack the SMU material for shipping to the Israel Antiquities
              Authority which will reintegrate the collections and pay the actual transport
              costs.

This project is significant because it will make an important
              archaeological collection available in its entirely for scientific study.
