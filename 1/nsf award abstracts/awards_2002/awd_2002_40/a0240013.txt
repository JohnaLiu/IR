Abstract    :
              The ordered movement of chromosomes during meiotic cell division is essential to
              the final development of the organism. In most instances, meiosis is comprised
              of three basic cellular processes: pairing, recombination and segregation.
              Pairing identifies homologs, recombination acts to lock them together, and
              segregation moves them to opposite poles at the first meiotic division.
              Establishing stable co-orientation requires a balancing of plateward and
              poleward forces acting on the kinetochores. This balancing of forces is usually
              achieved by chiasmata, the physical consequence of recombination. However, many
              organisms also possess systems that ensure the segregation of chromosomes that
              do not undergo recombination and the Drosophila female is one such organism.
              The focus of this project is an analysis of the mechanisms that allow proper
              meiotic segregation in the absence of chromosome exchange. NOD protein has been
              shown to control the poleward movement of achiasmate homologs as the meiotic
              spindle elongates during prometaphase. Preliminary data suggests that NOD has
              two additional functions: 1) providing a plateward balancing force that
              facilitates proper centromere coorientation; and 2) interlocking homologous
              chromosomes during early prometaphase. It has also recently been learned that
              NOD appears to be regulated extra-cellularly during meiotic prometaphase,
              perhaps via a cAMP-dependent signal transduction system. The specific aims of
              this project are: 1) Dissect the structure and regulation of the NOD protein.
              2) Continue studies of the Axs-transmembrane protein and its possible role in
              regulating the NOD protein. 3) Genetically test the hypothesis that Nod plays a
              role in mediating centromere coordination.

Failures in achiasmate
              segregation account for a high fraction of spontaneous nondisjunction in fly
              and human oocytes. The observation that the protein(s) responsible for
              achiasmate segregation may be regulated by hormonal cues provides the first
              insight as to why achiasmate nondisjunction may increase with advancing
              maternal age in human oocytes.
