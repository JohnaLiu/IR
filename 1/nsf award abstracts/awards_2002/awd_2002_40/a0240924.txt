Abstract    :
              Award is for a geophysical survey and piston coring project in the south central
              Pacific.  The object of the project is to conduct seismic profiling,
              geophysical surveys, and collect piston cores as a site survey for potential
              future ocean drilling in this area.  These data will help define Southern Ocean
              structure in the Pacific prior to the separate of Australia from Antarctica and
              the opening of the Drake Passage. The ultimate goal of this project is to
              decipher the workings of Earth's climatic systems during periods of very warm
              climate (the early Eocene). The results will help test computer models of
              Earth's climate under conditions very different from today's, define the
              important climate feedbacks that are important to maintain warm systems and
              contribute to our understanding of how the world may respond if the present
              warming trends continue.
