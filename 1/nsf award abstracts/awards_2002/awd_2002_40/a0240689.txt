Title:  Workshop for a
              Biometric Research Agenda

The objective of this workshop is to develop a
              consensus for a biometric research agenda by bringing together the national
              experts in various disciplines converging to the field of biometrics.  The
              disciplines include natural science and engineering, social science, political
              science, economics, and other disciplines.

The workshop will address the
              following topics:

What biometric technologies are currently deployed,
              currently available but not yet deployed, and in development that could be
              deployed in the foreseeable future?

What measures of effectiveness are
              required to ensure that these technologies help to provide security?

What
              are the economic verses effectiveness trade-offs of implementing these
              technologies?

What are the implications of biometric technologies for
              personal security and preservation of individual liberties, and for lifestyle
              within our society?
