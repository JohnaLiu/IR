Abstract    :
              The need for a technology roadmap for the capital projects industry has been a
              matter of discussion at many board meetings of corporations and industry
              organizations in recent years: it is part of the FIAPP (Fully Integrated and
              Automated Project Processes) Steering Committee's charter to desighn and
              develop a technology roadmap for the industry.  Since October 2001, a
              technology roadmap has been evolving to define a comprehensive technology
              research and development agenda, based on input from experienced,
              forward-thinking technical and business professionals from various parts of the
              capital projects industry.  The roadmap serves to identify critical technology
              needs that crosscut all sectors of the industry as well as the requirements for
              focused R&D to meet those challenges.  This small award recognizes the
              criticality of engaging the academic community at this stage in the development
              of the Roadmap R&D plans through financial support to academics to encourage
              them to attend FIATECH's Capital Projects Integrated Technology Roadmap
              Workshop in October .
