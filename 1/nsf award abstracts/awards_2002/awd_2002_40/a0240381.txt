The proposed work will focus on understanding how to control the
              strength, degradation, and elastomeric properties of a novel copolymer of
              glycerol and sebacic acid and on testing the feasibility of using this
              copolymer as a scaffold to grow ligament-like tissues in vitro under dynamic
              culture conditions.  The long term goal is to develop a model system for
              replacing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), the most commonly injured
              ligament in the knee.  It is hypothesized that a biodegradable scaffold with
              elastomeric properties similar to those of ligament will promote ligament
              tissue formation by facilitating cyclic stretching of the cell/scaffold
              construct and inducing cellular and extracellular matrix alignment. 

The
              specific aims are to: 1) Synthesize and characterize biodegradable copolymer
              scaffolds that are based on the condensation of glycerol and a diacid  and 2)
              evaluate fibroblast infiltration and the production of extracellular matrix
              (collagen and elastin) on the scaffolds synthesized under Aim 1.  Tools and
              techniques to be used include chemical synthesis, standard chemical and
              mechanical characterization of polymeric materials, time degradation studies,
              cell adhesion and proliferation assays, biochemical assays of extracellular
              matrix components and bioreactor design to effect cyclic stretching.
