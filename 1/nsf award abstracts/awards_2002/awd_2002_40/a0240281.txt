Abstract    :
              The World Summit will be the largest summit in UN history.  This global summit
              is a follow-on to the1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development held in
              Rio de Janeiro.  The WSSD will be in Johannesburg 26 August-7 September and
              over 100 heads of state are expected to attend.
  
A key U.S. message for the
              WSSD is the importance of concrete action on sustainable development.  To
              reinforce this message, the Smithsonian Institution is developing an exhibit
              that showcases projects and activities demonstrating the key U.S. themes for
              WSSD, interweaving governance, finance, science & technology, and
              partnerships.

The Smithsonian has taken the leadership in the USG
              interagency process on developing and coordinating the US exhibit at the World
              Summit.  Federal Departments and agencies are co-funding the U.S. presence. 
              NSF co-funding will provide supplies and services necessary to develop,
              install, and maintain the joint U.S. exhibit and to support the NSF involvement
              at the Exhibit.
