Abstract    :
              This proposal is to conduct a US-PRC joint workshop on development of new
              research opportunities for critical infrastructure protection. The focus will
              be on needed enabling technologies, and the identification of possible
              candidates for the purpose of demonstration and evaluation of these
              technologies, particularly those that can be applied to protect infrastructures
              against earthquake and other natural and manmade disasters in populated urban
              centers.  Special consideration will be given to two types of urban structural
              systems :a building complex and a transportation network, against earthquake
              ground motions and accidental and intentional blast loads.  This workshop is
              jointly supported the Ministry of Construction (MOC), National Natural Science
              Foundation (NNSF), Beijing Science and Technology Committee (BSTC), and Beijing
              Municipal Education Commission (BMEC) under the US-PRC Earthquake Protocol
              Annex III program.
