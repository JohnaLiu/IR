Abstract    :
              This project will develop methods for inferring migration flows from two
              successive counts of population stocks.  Such data on stocks in the past have
              been used to infer mortality and, indeed, of net migration.  But a workable
              method for using population stock data to infer directional (not net) migration
              flows has not been developed.  This project will draw on statistical
              representations of regularities in the age and spatial structures found in
              relatively complete data on migration streams to infer, in settings
              characterized by incomplete data, the directional flows that underlie and shape
              the population distributions enumerated by censuses and sample surveys.

This
              new method will benefit a number of different user groups.  Historical
              demographers will be able to identify changing mobility patterns hidden in
              recently released historical population censuses that lack a question on
              migration.  Migration analysts will be able to study mobility patterns in
              data-poor less-developed countries.  Furthermore, population researchers will
              be able to adapt to the prospective loss of migration data from the
              soon-to-be-eliminated "long form" questionnaire of the U.S. decennial censuses
              and its replacement by the American Community Survey, which is a significantly
              smaller continuous monthly sampling survey.
