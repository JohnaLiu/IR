Abstract:  The
              investigator is studying the problem of monomalization of algebraic mappings.
              The conjecture is to prove that an algebraic mapping can be factored by a
              sequence of monoidal transforms, a locally monomial mapping, and a sequence of
              inverse monoidal transforms. This problem is being considered in both
              characteristic zero and characteristic p. The investigator has recently solved
              the local form of this conjecture in characteristic zero. The investigator is
              also working on applications to valuation theory. Another problem is the
              characterization of normal surface singularities with rational Poincare series.
              The Poincare series is associated to the exceptional divisors of a resolution
              of singularities.

The investigator's work on monomialization will have
              important applications in other areas of mathematics and engineering. An
              immediate application is in the solution of systems of integral equations. One
              of the goals of the project is to find computable algorithms to transform
              systems of polynomial equations into monomial equations.
