Abstract    :
              Graduate students play a key role in the advancement of new and enabling ideas.
              Graduate students, particularly those in their final years of doctoral study,
              have expertise that is closely tied to the development, demonstration, and
              understanding of new concepts and technologies. The dissemination of these
              concepts, along with the intellectual development of the students that is a
              consequence of scientific and technical interaction, supports long-term
              leadership needed by the technical community. The funding provided by NSF would
              enable the MMM Conference to invite graduate students who are citizens or
              permanent residents of the United States to present papers in key areas of
              magnetism and to benefit from discussions with experts in the field. With
              breadth and quality, these presentations and interactions are an integral part
              of each Conference. Such interactions are essential if the Conference is to
              serve its purpose of providing an effective forum for the discussion of new,
              state-of-the-art results and developments in magnetics to the domestic and
              international scientific community.

The purpose of this proposal is to
              obtain NSF support to provide partial funding to allow graduate students to
              attend and to participate in the 2002 MMM Conference. The Conference is
              sponsored jointly by the American Institute of
Physics and the Magnetics
              Society of the Institute of Electricaland Electronic Engineers, in cooperation
              with the Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, the Office of Naval Research,
              the American Society for Testing and Materials, the American Physical Society,
              and the American Ceramic Society.
