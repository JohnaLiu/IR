Abstract    :
              Funds are provided for a workshop of ca. 40 US and New Zealand scientists
              interested in the study of the Waipaoa sedimentary system under the MARGINS
              program. Waipaoa River and its offshore dispersal system on the North Island of
              New Zealand is one of the two chosen focus areas of the "source-to-sink"
              initiative under MARGINS. A synopsis of what is known about the system and what
              needs to be monitored for developing meaningful models, as well as details of
              an implementation plan for research will be discussed at the meeting. The
              workshop will allow a more coordinated planning for MARGINS research on the
              Waipaoa system and the planned field trip will allow participants with
              first-hand experience of the on-land part of the system and the scientific
              issues involved. The workshop is seen as an important step towards developing a
              well-integrated and coordinated set of research proposals for the study of this
              focus area. A workshop report to NSF is planned.
