This three-year award for US-France cooperative research
              involves Steven S. Girschick and his graduates students at the University of
              Minnesota, Laifa Boufendi of the University of Orleans, and Pere Roca i
              Cabarrocas at the Ecole Plytechnique.  The objectives of their research are to
              share expertise and facilities that relate to:  plasma synthesis of
              nanoparticles, nanoparticle deposition to make films, and post deposition film
              processing.  The project takes advantage of French expertise in clustering and
              particle formation in plasmas and materials science.  It will advance
              understanding of plasma material synthesis and resulting applications to low
              friction and high wear resistance coatings for tools and in other industrial
              processes.  In the context of this cooperative research project. NSF will
              provide support for annual visits to France by the US investigator and his
              graduate students.
