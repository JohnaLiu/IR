Abstract    :
              This grant will support archival and library research on a projected biography
              of
Johannes Wislicenus (1835-1902), a major chemist of the nineteenth century
              whose career has yet to receive extensive study by historians. An outgrowth of
              the PIs recently completed book on the early history of stereochemistry, the
              goal of this project is to gather additional archival and published material on
              Wislicenus's youth as the son of the radical free-thinking theologian, Gustav
              Wislicenus (1803-1877), on his experiences as a failed immigrant to America, on
              his professional development with Wilhelm Heintz at the University of Halle,
              and on his role as director of three major research groups in
Zurich,
              Wurzburg, and Leipzig. The proposed biography will discuss the formation of a
              scientific personality, religion and science, the atomic theory in
              nineteenth-century chemistry, and the structure and purpose of research groups
              in science. The completed biography will also frame Wislicenus as a member of a
              particular generation of chemists born during the 1830s, and make comparisons
              of Wislicenus's personal style of doing and teaching science with other
              chemists of his generation. The final biography will therefore be of interest
              to historians of science, German historians, and practicing chemists.
