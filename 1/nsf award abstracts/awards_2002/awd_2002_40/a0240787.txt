              ABSTRACT

OCE-0240787

In this research project, scientists at the
              University of Hawaii will study the rate of nitrous oxide (N2O) formation in
              seawater and determine how production rate relates to the release of N2O to the
              overlying atmosphere in the eastern tropical North Pacific Ocean, the subarctic
              Pacific Ocean and in the Bering Sea. The experiments will identify the relative
              importance of the microbiological pathways by which N2O is produced in diverse
              marine environments. This study will take advantage of several new analytical
              innovations to refine our understanding of N2O cycling in the eastern tropical
              North Pacific and to extend our knowledge of N2O sources and sinks to the
              subarctic Pacific and the Bering Sea. The research team will take advantage of
              a rare opportunity to join already-funded research cruises to explore large
              regions of the ocean that are at once poorly understood but also very
              quantitatively significant in the workings of the global nitrogen cycle.
