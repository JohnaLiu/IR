Abstract    :
              This two-day workshop will define particular opportunities in the field of
              cognitive neuroscience.  It is unique in its intent to explicitly identify
              particular linkages to promote among cognition, computation and biology.  The
              three organizers are highly regarded leaders in their fields, and the speakers
              include a diverse group with many well-recognized names.  Topics include how to
              define cognitive neuroscience and how to use biological, behavioral and
              computational approaches to study cognition, and the format provides adequate
              time to discuss the several topics proposed.
   Results from the workshop will
              include a set of recommendations to NSF for programmatic and cross-directorate
              activity mechanisms to encourage productive new approaches to cognitive
              neuroscience.
