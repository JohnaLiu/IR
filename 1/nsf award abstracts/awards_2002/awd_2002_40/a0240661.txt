This award funds a three-year Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site at Western Michigan University for research in the
              relatively new field of Construction Engineering and Management. The objectives
              of this REU summer program include exposing participants to the research
              process through independent research projects and providing insight on the
              issue of ethics in the Construction Engineering and Management area. Ten
              students will participate each year for ten weeks. The research in which
              students will be involved will be in the following general topic areas, based
              on the on-going research of faculty mentors: (1) Composite Materials; (2)
              Bridge Management Systems; (3) Safety, Ergonomics, and Human Performance; and
              (4) Intelligent Transportation Systems.
