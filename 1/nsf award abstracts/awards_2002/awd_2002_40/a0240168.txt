Abstract    :
              In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Tubergen will use a Fourier Transform Microwave
              Spectrometer to study the influence of solvent molecules on molecular
              conformation.  The PI will develop a Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption source
              for a Fourier transform microwave spectrometer.  The source will be designed to
              vaporize biomolecules without decomposition.  Specifically, biomolecules,
              including amino acids and peptides and their complexes with water,  will be
              investigated.

The PI will engage graduate and undergraduate students in his
              research.  They will thereby receive training in forefront areas of
              contemporary physical chemistry.  The PI will also develop new spectroscopic
              experiments suitable for a physical chemistry instructional laboratory.
