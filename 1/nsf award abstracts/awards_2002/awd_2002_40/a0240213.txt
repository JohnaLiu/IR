Abstract    :
              In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, the PI will investigate the supramolecular dynamics of
              cyclodextrins (CDxs), and the factors that control the formation and stability
              of binary and ternary (1 guest: 2 host) molecular complexes.  The complexes
              consist of bromonaphthalene derivatives as guests and a host, which is
              primarily alpha-CDx.   Among other things the research will determine the
              binding constants and thermodynamic quantities for formation and dissociation
              for the 1:1 and 1:2 ground state complexes, as well as the rate constants for
              formation and dissociation.  This research will be conducted in a college and
              will be performed with undergraduate students.
