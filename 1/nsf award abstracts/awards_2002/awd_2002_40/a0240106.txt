Abstract    :
              This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research by Mary Rakowski-DuBois, Department of Chemistry and
              Biochemistry, University of Colorado and Daniel DuBois, National Renewable
              Energy Laboratory. The project plans to explore cooperative effects in
              reactions with molecular hydrogen and determine quantitative thermodynamic data
              for metal-centered proton and hydride donor/acceptor sites. This thermodynamic
              data will be used to design new electrocatalysts for hydrogen oxidation/proton
              reduction and for alcohol oxidation/aldehyde reduction. These electrocatalysts
              have potential application in new economical fuel cells.

The activation of
              molecular hydrogen is key to many industrial catalytic processes. The
              thermodynamic data from this project will be useful to the design of the next
              generation of catalysts. This project also continues a strong collaboration
              between the University of Colorado and NREL, providing a unique perspective for
              students and allowing access to research techniques and equipment.
