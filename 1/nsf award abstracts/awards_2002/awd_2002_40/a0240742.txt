Abstract    :
              This proposal is a mechanism to disburse funds to the National Oceanographic and
              Atmospheric Administration for the acquisition of reprints of special journal
              editions containing key articles by numerous NSF arctic principle investigators
              on the ecosystems in the Bering Sea.  The NOAA contact is placing the order on
              behalf of a NOAA editor/author and this is the only opportunity NSF will have
              to obtain copies for its own use.  The material will be used at the suggestion
              of the Arctic Section Head for arctic section information functions - primarily
              to distribute to individuals as background information on what NSF scientists
              have done in the Bering Sea.
