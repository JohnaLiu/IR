Abstract    :
              Snow avalanches are a significant hazard in the mountainous environments of the
              western United States and in alpine regions around the world.  Knowledge of
              spatial variations in snow stability and snowpack properties is critical for
              understanding and predicting snow avalanches.  Although previous research has
              investigated spatial variability on individual slopes, most studies have simply
              looked at a single snapshot in time of an extremely dynamic system.  This
              project attempts to fill this gap in fundamental knowledge by measuring and
              analyzing how the spatial variability of snowpack properties and snow stability
              vary through time.  Preliminary work on this topic suggests that snow stability
              on a given slope may diverge or become more spatially variable over time as the
              snowpack stabilizes in the absence of external influences.  If a slope is
              perturbed to the edge of instability, however, the snow stability may converge
              or become more spatially uniform.  This study will utilize a new snow stability
              test and a sensitive instrument co-developed by the Swiss Federal Institute for
              Snow and Avalanche Research and the U.S. Army Cold Regions Engineering
              Laboratory to measure temporal changes in snow stability.  Adjacent 900-square
              meter plots will be sampled through time at variety of field sites.  Data
              analyses will focus on how well snow stability measured in snowpits represents
              the mean of their respective plot and how spatial patterns of weak layer
              thickness, strength, and microstructure change through time.

The proposed
              research will address a pressing question for snow avalanche research and
              prediction, and it will offer new and important information for scientists
              about how the snowpack evolves and how avalanches release.  On a practical
              level, the work will provide critically relevant insights for avalanche
              professionals working to protect life and property.  The results of this
              research will enhance techniques for avalanche forecasting.  The results also
              will improve avalanche mitigation efforts that protect ski areas and highway
              corridors.  Finally, this work will benefit society by providing important new
              information for all people playing in, working in, living in, and traveling
              through mountain environments.
