This research project, with the support
              of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses the detailed
              structure of the ice surface.  Using the adsorption of several probe molecules
              combined with sum frequency generation studies of the vibrational spectroscopy
              of the ice surface, the location and mobility of hydrogen atoms on the ice
              surface will be determined.  Professor Shultz and her coworkers in the
              Department of Chemistry at Tufts University will examine the basic structure
              and reactivity of the single crystal ice surface.  This information will be
              useful for developing a basic understanding of the chemistry of ice surfaces,
              important in planetary atmospheres, terrestrial meteorology, and stratospheric
              chemical kinetics. 

Using the technique of sum frequency generation
              spectroscopy, Professor Shultz and her group at Tufts University are examining
              the surface of well characterized ice crystals.  By examining the interaction
              of the ice surface with various probe molecules, the location and motion of
              hydrogen atoms on the ice surface will be determined.  The basic information
              obtained from these studies is relevant to tropospheric and stratospheric
              molecule transport and reaction.
