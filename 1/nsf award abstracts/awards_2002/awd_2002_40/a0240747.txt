Abstract    :
              The long-term objective of this project is to enable near-daily satellite
              monitoring of thickness and water content of the active layer throughout the
              circumpolar Arctic. The PIs propose to test two hypotheses within the framework
              of Arctic-CHAMP: 1) Assimilation of plot-scale 1.4 or 6.9 GHz brightness in
              SVAT/Radiobrightness models will yield reliable histories of thickness and
              moisture content of the permafrost active layer; and 2) Assimilation of
              satellite-scale 1.4 or 6.9 GHz brightness in a distributed hydrology model
              having embedded SVAT/Radiobrightness linkages will yield meaningful spatially
              aggregated active layer histories. This assertion is supported by REBEX-3 data,
              which show plotscale 19 GHz brightness data (~3 m) to be nearly identical to
              SSM/I satellite-scale 19 GHz brightness data (~50 km) - a 4 order of magnitude
              span in spatial resolution. Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) models
              depict energy and moisture transport and storage processes in soil, vegetation,
              and snow. SVAT moisture profiles have been made accurate to meter depths
              through assimilation of the moisture content of the top 5 cm of soil inferred
              from 1.4 GHz brightness. Although similar tests have not been made with 6.9 GHz
              data, these data have significant sensitivity to soil moisture and are now
              available from the new AMSR satellite instrument. For the assimilation approach
              with either frequency to work in the Arctic requires that tundra SVAT models
              linking active layer moisture content to microwave brightness be developed and
              calibrated. A NASA Global Water and Energy Cycle (GWEC) Program grant is
              permitting the PIs to build upon the success of their prairie Land Surface
              Process/Radiobrightness (LSP/R) model to develop and calibrate a diagnostic
              LSP/R model for arctic tundra. The GWEC project includes a six-week, plot-scale
              calibration experiment near Toolik Lake in 2004. The PIs propose to (1) extend
              that calibration experiment to the entire summer season, (2) create a
              parameterized inversion model to assimilate 1.4 or 6.9 GHz brightness data from
              the calibration experiment to test hypothesis 1, (3) embed the tundra LSP/R
              model and the parameterized inversion model in an existing hydrology model of
              the upper Kuparuk River watershed, (4) acquire AMSR satellite 6.9 GHz
              brightness data and create a season-long "nature run" of 1.4 GHz brightness
              data for an area of the Watershed equal to a satellite footprint (~2,500 km2),
              and (5) assimilate the satellite and synthesized nature run data to test
              hypothesis 2. 
The research is interdisciplinary between the Department of
              Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Space Sciences and the Department of Electrical
              Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. It offers
              scientists and engineers across these disciplines unique collaborative
              opportunities to introduce new technologies to arctic environmental science.
