Abstract    :
              Jack Simons of the University of Utah is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical studies on the
              structures and dynamics of molecular anions.  Analytic models for describing
              vibrationally induced electron ejection will be developed.  Other applications
              include the interactions of low-energy electrons with DNA bases, electron
              binding to zwitterions, dipole-bound anions, and the electronic stability of
              dianions.  

This research advances the understanding of the nature of the
              chemical bond and of electronic dynamics through the study of unusual chemical
              species, including the prediction of new species whose existence may depend on
              new bonding paradigms.  Also, laboratory findings will be interpreted in order
              to add to the knowledge base of molecular anions.  The project on DNA damage
              may provide insight into genetic mutations and how to avoid them.
