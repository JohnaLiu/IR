Abstract    :
              The North American Perpendicular Magnetic Recording Conference (NAPMRC) is
              designed as a highly interactive focused meeting with the purpose to promote
              accelerated implementation of perpendicular recording.  Following the highly
              successful 1st NAPMRC convened on January 1-9, 2002 in Miami, FL, the 2nd
              NAPMRC will be held in Monterey, California on January 6-8, 2003.

This
              proposal will subsidize the registration fee for students from U.S.
              institutions.  Support from NSF will ensure that the program is open to the
              widest range of interested applicants from the U.S. universities.
