This award funds a three-year Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Houston for 15 students each
              year for research in electrical and computer engineering. The REU site is
              designed as a ten-week summer experience and will provide research
              opportunities for undergraduates in the areas of applied electromagnetics,
              computer architecture and automated design, optoelectronic materials and
              devices, perceptual and cognitive dynamics, and telecommunications. Each
              student will work on an assigned project under the direct supervision of a
              faculty member with expertise in his or her respective research area.
              Participants will be provided library, office, and laboratory space. The
              participants' development will be closely patterned after that of graduate
              students conducting research. During the necessary literature search and
              formulation of the problem, the student will be closely guided by his/her
              supervisor. As the participant gains command of the problem, he/she will be
              given increasing independence, with the supervisor providing only occasional
              ideas and suggestions. It is anticipated that students, as a result of
              participating in the program, will acquire the skills necessary to conduct
              independent research work. The program will focus on providing an experience
              that encourages participants to pursue graduate studies in preparation for
              career opportunities in research.
