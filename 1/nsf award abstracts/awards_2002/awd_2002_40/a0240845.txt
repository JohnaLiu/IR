Abstract    :
              Dr. Crate proposes to do extended research in several Viliui Sakha Villages of
              Russia on the resilience of agropastoralist Native communities in the
              Post-Soviet era of economic and environmental change.  The proposed research
              has three components described as: 1) Building Capacity, 2) Assessing
              Sustainability, 3) Gaining Knowledge.  Each of these components will be
              addressed throughout the proposed research period through both qualitative and
              quantitative research methodologies including participant observation,
              household surveys, structured interviews, and community meetings.  The research
              design in a collaboration with indigenous communities and unique in its
              multi-generational aspects.  It will add much to our understanding of social
              adaptation, resilience and sustainability of indigenous communitites in Russia.
               In addition, their will be broader impacts for local communities through the
              commuynity meeting and training aspects of the research project.
