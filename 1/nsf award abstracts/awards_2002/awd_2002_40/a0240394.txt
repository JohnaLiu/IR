Abstract    :
              This SDEST dissertation research improvement grant intends to explain the
              decision-making process of Institutional Research Boards (IRBs) at six U.S.
              research universities and to relate IRB structures and processes to their
              efficiency and effectiveness. In many areas of science and technology, human
              subjects issues raise fundamental questions about balancing risks and benefits
              to research participants and to society. Established to ensure ethical
              standards in the implementation of research that involves human participants,
              IRBs consist of groups of scientists and nonscientists, from the research
              institution and the community. They can approve, alter, or prohibit research
              protocols. Over 1,800 IRBs exist in the U.S., with a variety of structures,
              processes, and institutional contexts. While recent studies have examined IRB
              workloads and efficiency, systematic theory-driven empirical research is
              lacking on the effects of varying compositions of membership and on how IRB
              decision-making varies from institute to institute. This research will examine
              the relationship of IRB composition with human subjects decision processes,
              primarily via personal interviews with IRB members from a sample of research
              universities. Through the interdisciplinary lens of policy studies, this
              research will contribute to the development of an IRB decision-making model
              based on decision theory, science and technology studies, risk theory, and
              participatory analysis.
