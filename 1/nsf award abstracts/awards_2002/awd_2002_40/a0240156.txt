Abstract    :
              This award supports a planning meeting, which brings together industry,
              academic, government, and association representatives to define and outline
              roadmap that delineates the requirements to achieve the objectives of the
              larger project initiative entitled "Construction Engineering Professional 2020
              (CEP2020) objectives.

The challenge to the multi-billion dollar construction
              industry is how to succeed in the next 20 years.  The changes and forces
              currently impacting the constructing industry, suggest strongly that the
              traditional perspective of the industry, both from professionals within the
              industry and from observers outside the industry, must be altered. 
              Globalization will render obsolete long-held family and corporate traditions in
              industry enterprises. Current growth trends of faculty and departments of
              Construction Engineering suggest the need for universities to reexamine the
              educational needs of future professionals. The traditional viewpoint that a
              basic understanding of scheduling, estimating, contracts, and engineering is a
              satisfactory foundation no longer is sufficient.  Rather, the question for
              industry and academia alike is how to address the construction engineering
              profession and professionals of the future.  Where will these professionals
              emerge?  How will they be educated? What tools will they use?  What will be
              their primary focus as professionals?  Will these individuals be the
              integrators of the design-construction process, or will they be the technology
              experts focusing on satisfying customer requirements, or maybe they will be the
              surrogate owners, financing, building, and operating projects on an
              international scale.  The time to develop the vision to answer these questions
              is now.

The CEP2020 effort is designed to address three specific
              objectives:
What is the current state of the construction engineering
              professional?
What will the construction engineering professional be in
              2020?
What is the evolutionary path required to enable the construction
              professional to achieve the 2020 vision?
