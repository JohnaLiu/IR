Abstract    :
              In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, The PI will carry out a research program to investigate the
              effects of correlation and exchange on the solvation dynamics and adiabatic
              couplings that control electron transfer.  Ongoing work on the
              charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) reaction of solvated alkali metal atoms will
              be continued with femtosecond techniques.  New pump-probe experiments will be
              used to identify the transient intermediates formed during CTTS and for mapping
              out the dynamics of solvent dissipation.  The research will be conducted with
              the assistance of graduate students.  They will be trained in a forefront area
              of contemporary physical chemistry in preparation for advanced studies or entry
              into the country's workforce.
