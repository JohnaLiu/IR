Abstract    :
              
The project will support the development and implementation of a
              workshop/symposium, held by the College of Engineering of Tuskegee University,
              in partnership with a number of engineering departments and engineering
              colleges, professional organizations, and individual experts. The event will
              facilitate the gathering of information to establish the methods used by the
              HBCU engineering schools to achieve success in degree production among
              underrepresented minorities, especially African-American students. The
              symposium will also address the development of a vision for strengthening HBCU
              engineering institutions, determining what strategies might assist the further
              development of students, and improving corporate partnerships, governmental
              service, and collaboration with majority institutions. 

By identifying
              successful practices and disseminating these findings by way of the proposed
              collaborative website and other participant-based communications through
              participating institutions, the PI anticipates that engineering
              departments/colleges will be motivated to consider ways to improve their
              academic programs through use of the best practices established in the
              symposium (and documented by participants).
