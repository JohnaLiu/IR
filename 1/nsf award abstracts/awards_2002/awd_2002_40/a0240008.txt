Abstract    :
              Alan Cowley, Department of Chemistry, University of Texas at Austin, is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              for his exploration of new Group 13 compounds. The particular focus is on
              boranediyls and their metal complexes, synthesis, characterization and further
              reactions with organic and organometallic molecules. Boranediyls are
              electron-poor compounds with a formal B(I) oxidation state. Cowley uses
              sterically encumbering ligands to stabilize these reactive molecules. In
              addition to the fundamental interest in boranediyl electronic structure, these
              molecules may provide useful routes into metal boride nanoparticles and
              boron-containing polymers. 

Boron has a rich chemistry that can be exploited
              in catalysis and materials synthesis. Chemical vapor deposition may provide a
              route into new metal boride nanoparticles. Polymers containing boron often have
              useful optical and electronic properties. Students will be trained in demanding
              synthetic techniques as well as state-of-the-art characterization tools for
              molecules, polymers and solid state materials.
