The synthesis and
              characterization of transition metal nano-particles is the focus of this
              research project, being carried out at the Georgia Institute of Technology by
              co-P.I.'s El-Sayed and Wang and their coworkers.  With the support of the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, the structure, formation mechanism,
              and thermal and photothermal stability of tranisition metal nanocrystals are
              being examined.  Methods for controlling and affecting the growth morphology of
              these nanocrystals are examined using electron microscopy and spectroscopic
              probes.  The dependence of the nanoparticle stability on the type of metal, the
              shape of the particle, the type of the capping ligand, and the nature of the
              chemical environment is examined.  The results of these studies will be useful
              in evaluating nanoparticle materials for use in heterogeneous catalysis
              applications.  

Metal nanoparticles show great promise for applications in
              heterogeneous catalysis.  The rational understanding of the growth, the control
              of size and shape, and understanding the stability of these materials is the
              focus of this research project supported by the Analytical and Surface
              Chemistry Program.  Professors El-Sayed and Wang and their coworkers at Georgia
              Tech are combining synthesis, spectroscopic characterization, and electron
              microscopic characterization of these important materials to gain this
              understanding.
