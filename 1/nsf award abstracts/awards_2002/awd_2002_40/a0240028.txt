ABSTRACT

The project will support a workshop, held by the American
              Mathematical Society, in partnership with a number of colleges and
              universities, professional organizations, and individual experts, on the
              mentoring and nurturing of students in mathematics. The goal is to build
              awareness in the mathematics community that programs with the identified
              characteristics can enhance student academic experiences, improving student
              performance as well as aiding in attracting and retaining students.

The
              workshop agenda is to identify and showcase effective mentoring methods to
              improve attraction and retention of underrepresented minorities in mathematics,
              utilizing expertise form institutions that have demonstrated successful
              mentoring and nurturing. The workshop will include programs directed toward
              undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students. 

By identifying
              successful practices and disseminating these findings by way of the AMS website
              and other professional society communications, and through participating
              institutions, the PI anticipates that mathematics departments will be motivated
              to initiate programs with mentoring components, which is expected to improve
              departmental environment.
