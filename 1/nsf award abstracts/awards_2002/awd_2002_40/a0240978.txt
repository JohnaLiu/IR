              ABSTRACT

PI/Institution:  Spall / WHOI			Proposal No:  OCE-0240978

The
              export of recently ventilated high latitude water masses from their formation
              basins via 
narrow boundary currents is a central, and not well understood,
              aspect of the global thermohaline circulation.  The primary objectives of the
              proposed work are: 1) to compare and contrast lateral exchange with the
              interior and direct atmospheric forcing as mechanisms to get recently formed
              water masses into rapid boundary currents and 2) to determine how these
              processes are related to the downwelling limb of the thermohaline circulation. 
              By making use of both high resolution numerical models and simple theories,
              this process-oriented approach is designed to illuminate the dynamical balances
              in this near boundary regime.  Finally, we will build on this dynamical
              framework to analyze real data from the Labrador Sea.  By comparing and
              contrasting model results and data, we will attempt to identify, in the data,
              the processes that lead to a densification of the boundary current in the
              region and to estimate the rate of export of Labrador Sea water. The proposed
              study will have broader impacts spanning both research and educational
              activities.  The insight gained by this process study will provide the
              foundation for parameterizations of this important and presently unresolved
              component of the thermohaline circulation for implementation in climate
              models.
