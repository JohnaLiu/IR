Abstract    :
              In this exploratory research, an integrated methodology involving
              microstructure-level simulations and sustainability metrics will be developed
              to evaluate the environmental benefits of simulated microstructure-level
              improvements for a pilot steel component. This work represents the first phase
              of a comprehensive research thrust to determine the potential environmental
              benefits of microstructure-level simulations and to develop a design
              methodology to optimize the microstructure of a steel component based on its
              life-cycle environmental performance. 

The key to the feasibility of this
              project is the ability to adapt sustainability metrics into a useful
              decision-support tool for evaluating environmental impacts of alternatives for
              the design of steel components, such as the different steel microstructures
              with their associated manufacturing processes and product characteristics for
              desired product performance. Collaboration with Caterpillar will focus on both
              the technical research tasks and the educational foundation for undergraduate
              student interns.
