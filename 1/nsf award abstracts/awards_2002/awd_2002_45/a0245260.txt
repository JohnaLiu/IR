This research project, supported in the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses the fundamental chemistry
              needed to allow the integration of semiconductor and organic thin film
              materials.  Synthetic strategies for the controlled attachment of organic
              molecules to semiconductor materials are being developed by Professor Bent and
              her coworkers in the Chemical Engineering Department at Stanford University. 
              Approaches to first layer attachment are being examined, along with general
              strategies for the attachment of second layer molecules to the organic
              interface.  The third focus of the research is on the controlled patterning of
              these semiconductor-organic interfaces.  The results of this work provide the
              fundamental understanding necessary for the development of the processing
              chemistry for the next generation of molecular electronic devices.

With the
              support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Bent and her
              collaborators at Stanford University are exploring synthetic strategies for the
              attachment of organic layers to silicon and germanium surfaces.  Using
              approaches developed in standard organic synthesis, they are investigating
              vacuum based methods for the controlled modification of semiconductor surfaces
              with a range of organic molecules.  The results of this research provide the
              basis for the processing of molecular electronic devices.
