At the
              center of the proposed conference will be a series of lecture
by Professor
              Andrew Casson of Yale University.  These lecture will
focus on two of the most
              important open questions in the fields of
topology and group theory.  The
              first question, the Poincare
Conjecture, was posed by Henri Poincare almost
              100 years ago.  It is
concerned with the basic structure of very simple
              3-dimensional
spaces; while the Andrews-Curtis Conjecture is about
              algebraic
structures, and is very relevant to the Poincare Conjecture. 
              In
addition to a survey of existing approaches, partial results and
              open
questions related to these conjectures, these talks will attempt
              to
describe some intriguing similarities and differences between the
              two
conjectures.  In addition, 10 leading experts from around the world
will
              deliver talks about their own work.

This conference will be the 28th annual
              Arkansas Spring Lecture
Series.  The format of the lecture series is 5 one
              hour talks by a
world leading mathematician, accompanied by about 10 lectures
              of
invited experts, and several shorter talks by a variety of
              people,
including graduate students.  This structure is valuable,
              particularly
for younger researchers, that get an excellent learning
              opportunity.
This year's Lecture Series is about 3-dimensional topology.
              The
importance of low dimensional topology has been growing in recent
tears,
              with numerous applications starting at robotics and control,
and ending with
              theoretical physics and cosmology.  For example, one
intriguing question is
              what the shape of the Universe is.  The
spherical shape of the earth was
              discovered two millennia ago, and yet
we have no clue as to the shape of the
              Universe.  The work of
Professor Casson as well as other leading
              mathematician, may help
answer this question by leading astronomers is the
              right direction,
and helping design the right experiments to answer these
              questions.
Jeff Weeks, a McArthur Fellow, will discuss such experiments in
              a
lecture open to the public and using a language accessible to all.
This
              will give the public an opportunity to understand the work of
world leading
              mathematicians.  Jeff Weeks talk should have great
educational value in
              motivating younger students to enjoy basic
research.
