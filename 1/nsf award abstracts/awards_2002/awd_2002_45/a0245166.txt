Abstract    :
              The funding is for the "Fourth International Workshop on Objective Prior
              Methodology," to be held June 15-20, 2003, in Aussois, France.  The principal
              objectives of this meeting are to facilitate the exchange of recent research
              developments in objective prior methodology, to provide opportunities for new
              researchers, and to establish new collaborations which will channel efforts
              into pending problems and open new directions for investigation. An important
              consequence of this meeting will be to further crystallize objective prior
              methodology as an established area for statistical research.  Most of the
              funding will go towards expenses of new researchers. The meeting will be
              organized to actively encourage participation of new researchers and
              underrepresented groups, and to provide opportunities for the initiation of
              international collaborations.
