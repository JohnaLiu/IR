Abstract    :
              0245216  Brezonik  The CLEANER Workshop 2 will build on the results of CLEANER
              Workshop1. In that workshop, it was explicitly recommended to convene another
              workshop devoted to Environmental Field Facilities (EFFs). Thus, CLEANER
              Workshop 2 is in response to that recommendation.   The continuing development
              of the CLEANER initiative leads to an effort devoted to defining the concept of
              (EFFs).  The agenda for CLEANER Workshop 2  has been developed and will
              include:  review the results of CLEANER Workshop 1 "Large Scale Environmental
              Challenges: CLEANER as the Engineering Approach";  Status/Experience for
              CLEANER; Defining an EFF(with breakout sessions); Modeling; Environmental
              Cyberinfrastructure;  Sensor Needs, Development, and Networking: Initial
              Insights, and the Path Forward.  This workshop is an important next step in
              securing a cross-discipline view of  the evolution of CLEANER.
This Workshop
              will be held at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, on  October 20-22,
               2002.  The workshop will be attended by approximately 50 scientists and
              engineers from the academic, consultant and governmental communities.  A report
              summarizing the results of the workshop will be prepared by the steering
              committee and submitted to the Environmental Engineering Program Director by
              December, 2002.
