Digital Government: SGER:
              LOCKSS Government Documents

This proposal will explore the usefulness and
              appropriateness of a distributed peer to peer network-based storage and
              archiving technology for the long-term (decades) maintenance of Federal
              records.  Using a system known as LOCKSS, the PI will collaborate with the
              Government Printing Office and its group of 55 Federal Depository LIbraries. 
              The hope is to provide new options to the current model of a central archieve
              with off-site backups.
