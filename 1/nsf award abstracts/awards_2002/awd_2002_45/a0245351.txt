Abstract    :
              This proposal requests travel support for an electrical engineering students
              (with a major in power engineering) across the United States to attend the 35th
              annual North American Power Symposium (NAPS) to be held on October 19-21, 2003
              at the University of Missouri-Rolla, MO.  Travel expenses could be a deterrent
              for undergraduate or graduate students planning to attend this symposium. 
              

NAPS is an annual symposium, sponsored by the Institute of Electrical &
              Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and a university on the North American Continent.
              At this symposium, university professors and students are encouraged to present
              the results of their research among colleagues at an early stage in their
              work.

NAPS participants are from the electrical/computer engineering
              departments of major universities in the country with research interests in
              different areas of power engineering, some from universities abroad, and some
              from industry. NAPS authors are required to attend the symposium and present
              their papers.

This proposal discusses the justification for travel support,
              requested from the National Science Foundation, for student authors attending
              the symposium. It also discusses activities planned for the symposium, and the
              impact of the proposed travel grant.
