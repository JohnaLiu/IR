Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding for the analytical analysis of models that
              coordinate pricing, production and inventory decisions in an attempt to develop
              optimal or near optimal algorithms for them.  Interestingly, concepts such as
              convexity or k-convexity, that have been proven effective for classical
              inventory models, do not directly apply for models with general, price
              dependent, stochastic demand processes. Thus, to analyze models that
              incorporate pricing decisions, the concept of symmetric k-convex functions has
              been developed and applied to a variety of pricing problems including finite
              and infinite horizon single product models. This concept settled a
              long-standing conjecture and characterized the structure of the optimal policy
              for each of these problems.

This research will continue with the analysis,
              development and implementation of algorithms for different variants of models
              that integrate pricing, production and inventory decisions. The focus is on
              developing theoretical and practical methods that utilize the available
              information to improve supply chain efficiencies and ultimately the company
              bottom line. Specifically, the research will focus on (i) applying the notion
              of symmetric k-convex functions to a variety of pricing models including models
              with multiple classes of customers differentiated by their sensitivity to price
              and lead-time, as well as models with discretionary sales; (ii) develop
              computational methods and test their effectiveness using data received from
              industrial partners; and (iii) apply the notion of symmetric k-convexity to
              other operational management problems.
