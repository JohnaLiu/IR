Title: Rocky Mountain Discrete Mathematics Conferences

     This
              project supports a 3-year sequence of Rocky Mountain 
regional
              mini-conferences  in Discrete Mathematics and its 
applications. Each  two day
              meeting    features  plenary talks by 
outside experts on focused,
              contemporary themes in Discrete 
Mathematics. The topics and plenary speakers
              are:

2003: Generalizations of interval graphs and their applications
      
              Speakers: Jeremy Spinrad (Vanderbilt University)
       Ann Trenk (Wellesley
              College)

2004:  Tournaments
        Brooks Reid (California State San
              Marcos)
        Steve Kirkland (University of Regina)

2005:
       
              Algebraic Graph Theory
        Chris Godsil (University of Waterloo)
       
              Willem Haemers (Tilburg University).


     This project  supports a  3-year
              sequence of annual two-day 
conferences for mathematicians and
              computer
scientists in the Rocky Mountain region.   The conferences   (a)
              
provide an encouraging environment for young researchers and 
graduate
              students, (b) inform researchers of some of the latest 
developments in
              discrete mathematics, and (c) strengthen 
collaborative, and interdisciplinary
              research ties among discrete 
mathematicians in the  Rocky Mountain
              region.
