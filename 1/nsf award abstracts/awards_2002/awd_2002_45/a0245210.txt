Abstract    :
              The PI will investigate several aspects of the
localization-delocalization
              transition in Anderson-type random
Schr\"odinger operators. One goal is the
              development of new
methods to characterize energy regimes with localized
              wave
functions. The main focus will be on the fractional moment
(or
              Aizenman-Molchanov) method, which has recently been shown to
apply to
              continuum disordered systems. The PI and his
collaborators will further
              increase the applicability of this
method and use it to study several open
              problems such as the
localization properties of continuum surface models and
              the
Anderson model on continuum strips. Another objective is to
              study
mathematical mechanisms which show existence of
extended states in
              disordered media. For example, this will be
studied through one-dimensional
              random polymers, where an extended
state at a single energy can lead to
              significant electron
transport. The PI and collaborators will also develop
              perturbation
theoretic methods to study the high energy spectrum
              of
multi-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with quasi-periodic
potentials,
              and, in particular, establish the existence of
extended states for this
              model.

The Anderson model is used to describe the conductivity
              properties
of disordered media. This includes crystals with imbedded
              or
substitutional impurities, alloys, amorphous media, the effects of
lattice
              fluctuations at high temperature, and quasi crystals. The
central goal is to
              understand the effects of disorder on electron
transport and therefore to
              distinguish between conductors and
insulators. The phenomena which are
              observed are not restricted to
quantum mechanical waves, but extend to the
              propagation of
acoustic, electro-magnetic and elastic waves in disordered
              media.
Applications in engineering include the study of random
imperfections
              in quantum wave guides, photonic crystals, and
anomalous transport in quasi
              crystals. The PI's research is aimed
at finding mathematically rigorous
              justifications of the Anderson
transition, stipulating that disordered media
              can undergo a phase
transition from insulator to conductor at sufficiently
              high
energy.
