Abstract    :
              This project will investigate and develop a Biologically Inspired Intelligent
              Fault Management System using Artificial Immune System (AIS) technologies on
              top of a Neural Network - Fuzzy Logic (NN-FZ) structure to actively manage
              power distribution system faults, including diagnosis, prognosis, and data
              mining. The proposed approach can answer the challenges of discovering new
              fault diagnosis knowledge based on the dynamic operating environments, in
              addition to providing accurate fault diagnosis and prognosis. The NN-FZ
              technology will be used to aggregate information collected from sources such as
              SCADA system, circuit database, fault database, etc., to perform fault
              diagnosis and prognosis. Then an AIS algorithm will be used to guide the NN-FZ
              to learn, absorb, adapt, evolve and improve the fault diagnosis performance
              based on existing information such as the distribution system's network
              topology, operating conditions and weather conditions, and depending upon newly
              acquired information, such as new faults and operating conditions. This
              proposed system can data mine the existing outage database and explain
              heuristics about the fault diagnosis and prognosis process as preferred by
              operators and engineers. It can disseminate learned information to other power
              distribution centers, thereby preventing the reoccurrence of "learned"
              problems. This system would revolutionize the Fault Diagnosis process for power
              distribution systems, to significantly increase system reliability and reduce
              operation costs. The proposed activities and architectures are not only limited
              to power distribution system, but are also applicable to other industries such
              as communication networks and transportation system that are large scale
              nonlinear system with uncertain operating environments.
