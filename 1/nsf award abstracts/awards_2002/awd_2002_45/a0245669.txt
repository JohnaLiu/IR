Abstract    :
              This proposal is one of three proposals to each plan participation in a new
              multi-university I/UCRC that aims to promote a research program of interest to
              both industry and universities on the analysis of multiphase phenomena. This
              new multi-university center will be able to have a broad impact on the industry
              through having each member's resources being enhanced by those of its partners
              which are also being recommended to receive a planning grant.  The three
              partners, of which this is one are the Michigan State University, University of
              Tulsa, and University of Akron.

The proposed Center's goal is to focus on
              tackling the sophisticated  challenges of computational multiphase transport
              phenomena which are  of importance in the  automotive, biochemical, chemical,
              food, mining, petrochemical an pharmaceutical industries.

The new center
              will focus on challenging  problems in:

- Multiphase turbulent flows

              -Multiphase materials processing,
- Multiphase mixing
- Next generation
              filtration based on nanoscale fibers, and multiphase separations.
