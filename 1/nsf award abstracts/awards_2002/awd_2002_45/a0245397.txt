Abstract:

The
              research will go in three different directions:

1] Methods of the theory of
              dynamical systems for the analysis of solutions of equations of hydrodynamics:
              The existence problem for the 3D-Navier-Stokes system remains a challenge.  The
              theory of dynamical systems can help to find new directions for research.

2]
              (3x+1) - problem and other number-theoretic dynamical systems: These
are
              long-standing and easily formulated problems.  The goal is to find hidden
              structures which can help to get a progress in the analysis of typical
              orbits.

3]  Problem of adiabatic piston: It is one of popular problems in
              non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.  Methods from ergodic theory and
              probability theory can be useful.


The theory if dynamical systems is an
              interdisciplinary branch of mathematics which has many applications in physics,
              engineering, biology, etc.  It is assumed that it will be applied to some
              problems in hydrodynamics, number theory and non-equilibrium statistical
              mechanics. In all cases I intend to work on several central problems in each of
              these cases.
