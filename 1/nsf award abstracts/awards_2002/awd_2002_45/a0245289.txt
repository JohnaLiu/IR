Abstract    :
              This project involves a workshop of scholars expert in studying African
              agricultural history and ethnography.  The scholars will meet over three days
              to exchange information and develop research strategies to advance the study of
              how agriculture changes over time, specifically in land use as assessed by
              remote sensing, and the role of generational change among farmers themselves in
              this process. 
Broader impacts: The new knowledge to be created about the
              nature of African food production will be valuable to agricultural and
              environmental policy makers and planners as well as to other scholars of the
              topic.
