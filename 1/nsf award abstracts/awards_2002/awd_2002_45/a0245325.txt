Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to 'rescue' a unique dataset that spans 1913-1960
              and that includes information about the demography of subalpine plants in the
              Rocky Mountains. The dataset is in danger of being lost because of difficulties
              in archiving the original data and the retirement of the last investigator
              involved in the project. Over 1000 chart quadrat maps will be archived
              digitally; these maps mark the locations and sizes of every plant in 91 1-meter
              quadrats. Maps will be digitized and made available to the scientific and
              management communities via the Shortgrass Steppe-Long Term Ecological Research
              web set. A photographic archive of the original maps also will be prepared. The
              resulting database will be valuable to resource managers as well as to the
              ecological community. Both graduate and undergraduate students will receive
              training in GPS technology.
