 The Society for Integrative & Comparative Biology
              (SICB) emphasizes the comparative approach and multidisciplinary integration of
              cellular and molecular concepts into a functional framework involving the whole
              organism. The Division of Neurobiology is one of the youngest of the ten
              divisions of SICB; this symposium is its second annual program. The symposium
              highlights work from the local region near the meeting city, with a unique plan
              that pairs talks from a junior member with one from the laboratory head. This
              plan gives excellent experience and exposure with low cost to younger
              researchers in a small meeting. This year the talks are related to motor
              control, with five pairs of speakers, and the meeting in Toronto, Canada
              involves international participants. The topics are timely, on invertebrate and
              vertebrate systems, and the main speaker in each pair is widely recognized.
              Modest funding is for travel awards for participants. Dissemination of the SICB
              Symposia is through publication in the journal Integrative & Comparative
              Biology.
   The SICB meetings also have an impact on training and education by
              bringing in graduate and undergraduate students and postdocs for
              interdisciplinary interactions with established investigators.
