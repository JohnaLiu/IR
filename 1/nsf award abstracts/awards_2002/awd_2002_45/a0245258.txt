Abstract


Title: Analytic aspects of L-functions
              and their applications

   This proposal is primarily concerned with the
              analytic aspects of 
automorphic forms and automorphic L-functions related to
              the 
Ramanujan-Selberg conjecture for GL(n) and the quantum unique ergodicity
              on
arithmetic groups, from the perspectives of analytic number theory. 

 
              The questions addressed to in this proposal are important open questions,
the
              resolution of which would have profound impact on our understanding of 
the
              complete picture of the underlying theories. Motivated by recent advance, 
the
              goal of the present projects is to make contributions to these fundamental
              
problems by refining current techniques and by exploring new approaches.
