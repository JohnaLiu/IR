Abstract    :
              OCE-0245278

Recognizing the need for international coordination of ocean
              carbon observations, the SCOR-IOC Advisory Panel on Ocean CO2 and the
              IGBP-IHDP-WCRP Global Carbon Project have initiated a collaborative Pilot
              Project to (1) gather information about on-going and planned ocean carbon
              observation activities, (2) identify gaps and duplications in ocean carbon
              observations, (3) produce recommendations that optimize resources and highlight
              potential scientific benefits of a coordinated observation program, and (4)
              promote the integration of ocean carbon observations with appropriate
              atmospheric and/or terrestrial carbon activities.  The information gathered
              through this collaborative process will be posted on a new Web site devoted to
              making the information accessible to scientists and policymakers worldwide.   
              

The first activity of the Pilot Project will be a workshop to bring
              together individuals from different countries who make and use ocean carbon
              observations, to discuss coordination of underway pCO2 measurements and repeat
              hydrographic sections, and begin discussions of how these observations can
              contribute to ocean carbon modeling and research activities.  This proposal is
              to fund the partial or full expenses for 50 individuals to participate in the
              workshop and to disseminate the results.
