Abstract    :
              This project continues the work initiated earlier on analysis and modeling of
              storms observed on the STEPS program (Severe Thunderstorm Electrification and
              Precipitation Study) conducted in Kansas in the early summer of 2000.  It
              includes the analysis of cloud electrical and microphysical data collected by
              the storm-penetrating T-28 aircraft and modeling the production of charge and
              precipitation with a three-dimensional numerical cloud model.  The research is
              carried out in collaboration with other STEPS investigators, who will provide
              data including polarimetric radar measurements to identify precipitation type,
              dual-Doppler radar measurements to define the kinematic structure of
              thunderstorms, balloon-borne electrical field measurements, and
              three-dimensional maps of lightning strokes measured by a VHF lightning mapper.
               Attention will focus on the storms of 11 June and 29 June 2000.  A major
              objective is to explain why some storms produce predominantly positive
              cloud-to-ground lightning discharges while others produce negative discharges. 
              A synthesis of the electrical, microphysical, and storm-structure data will
              lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of lightning formation in
              thunderstorms and the relations between electrical properties of storms and the
              precipitation they produce.
