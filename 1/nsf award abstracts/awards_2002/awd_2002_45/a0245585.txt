Abstract    :
              This symposium will bring together about thirty leading thinkers and policy
              makers in several related areas of cyberinfrastructure for science, including
              scientific collaboratories, grid computing, and e-science environments. The
              goal is to bring together international representatives of these movements and
              communities to better create mutual awareness and understanding and to
              accelerate research, development, and deployment of these new environments to
              support science. A related objective is to articulate both the technical and
              social/organizational prerequisites for success in these endeavors. This
              nascent movement has profound implications for science education, for education
              and research in the humanities and for the future of the entire higher
              education enterprise.
