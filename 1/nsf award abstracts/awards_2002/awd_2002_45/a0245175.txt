Abstract    :
              This proposal is a request for support to help cover the costs of organizing the
              conference "Quantum Field Theory Under the Influence of External Conditions".
              It will take place from September 15-19, 2003 in Norman Oklahoma on the
              University of Oklahoma Campus. The funds will be used entirely to support
              graduate students, Post-docs and junior faculty who otherwise could not afford
              to attend the meeting.
