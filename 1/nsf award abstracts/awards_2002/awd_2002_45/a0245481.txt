This project will continue the program initiated several
              years ago by the principal investigator in collaboration with Alain Connes,
              providing a general setting for the understanding of transverse geometry. A
              main new objective consists in the application of this program to the context
              of modular forms and modular correspondences, in order to uncover  the hidden
              compatibility between the pointwise product of modular forms and the action of
              the Hecke operators.  Another major goal of the proposed research is the
              elaboration of a K-theoretic interpretation for the Godbillon-Vey class and for
              other secondary invariants, by means of a refinement of the operator-theoretic
              local index formula that lies at the core of the program. 
The proposed work
              will contribute to the development of new mathematical tools for the treatment
              of a multitude of non-classical spaces, which have a discernible geometric
              meaning but cannot be adequately described by means of commuting coordinates. 
              Such spaces, arising in many areas of mathematics and physics, have in common
              the feature that their observable local parameters behave like
              infinite-dimensional matrices rather than numerical variables.  To deal with
              them efficiently much stretching and rethinking of the known geometric
              techniques is required, process that has led to the development of
              noncomutative geometry. A distinctive feature of the present project is the
              systematic utilization of non-classical symmetry principles.
