Abstract    :
              This proposal is to plan for an I/UCRC that aims to promote a research program
              of interest to both industry and universities on telecommunications circuits
              and systems, by joining with the currently established I/UCRC at Arizona State
              University.  This proposed multi-university center will be able to have a broad
              impact on the telecommunications industry by using the joint resources of the
              multiuniversity faculties.

The proposed Center's goal is to focus on
              simplifying and advancing communications systems by identifying new circuits
              and new circuit-design techniques as well as new methods in systems design and
              information technology.

All research would be carried out within the
              multiuniversity center with its own resoueres aas well as those of the existing
              I/UCRC at Arizona State Universaity.  The overall aim of this collaborator as
              well as the existing Center is to build partnerships between industry and
              academe through conducting appropriate research while transferring technology
              both ways to the benefit of both parties.
