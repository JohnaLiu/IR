                                  ABSTRACT


Lie Theory is a central discipline in modern
              mathematics and plays a key role in diverse areas such as harmonic analysis,
              differential geometry, number theory, algebra and mathematical physics. The
              co-principal investigators will utilize funding to continue and enhance the
              Western regional workshop series "Lie Groups, Lie Algebras and their
              Representations" which is devoted to Lie Theory and which has been flourishing
              for over ten years.

The series of weekend meetings that are the main focus
              of the workshop will provide a unique opportunity for graduate students and
              junior researchers to become acquainted with research and researchers in the
              western part of the US who work in Lie Theory. The co-principal investigators
              will encourage and facilitate collaborative research, especially between junior
              and senior researchers, and provide opportunities for advanced graduate
              students to confer with experts at other universities.
