ABSTRACT.
              This conference on Partial Differential Equations and Applications to be held
              at the University of Notre Dame in August 2003
will bring together experts
              from nonlinear elliptic, parabolic, and evolution equations and their
              applications, numerical methods in electromagnetics and acoustics, and
              reaction-diffusion equations in biological modeling, to share their research
              results, ideas, and  insight regarding future directions. The conference is of
              interdisciplinary character with strong connections to sciences and
              engineering. There is a multitude of challenging, open problems
where progress
              could be of great interest to a wider scientific community. Such progress
              requires expert knowledge of advanced and technically difficult mathematics as
              well as an understanding of current problems and methods of physics, chemistry,
              biology,  and engineering. Young researchers and graduate students, in
              particular women and minorities, are especially invited to participate in this
              conference and interact with specialists in diverse areas, thus helping them 
              enhance their scientific development in mathematics the sciences and
              engineering.
