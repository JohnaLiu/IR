Abstract    :
              The PI plans to continue his research into the
enumerative and topological
              properties of matroids.  
Introduced in 1935 by Whitney, matroids are
              a
combinatorial abstraction of one of the fundamental
structures of
              mathematics, linear independence.  The
enumerative aspect of the work involves
              combining
techniques from commutative algebra, topology and
combinatorics in
              order to study h-vectors of broken
circuit and independence complexes. 
              These
combinatorial invariants appear in applications to
hyperplane
              arrangements, linear coding theory, network
reliability and quotients of
              spheres.  Topological
properties of matroids will be explored using
              the
investigator's recent discovery that matroids can be
represented as
              arrangements of homotopy spheres.  This
point of view indicates possible
              applications to
combinatorial projective planes, oriented matroids
              and
classical bundle theories.

This research is in the general area of
              combinatorics.
One of the central themes in combinatorics is the
enumeration
              of discrete objects with complicated
structure.  For instance, this proposal
              includes
methods for estimating the reliability of large
networks of the type
              that might be found in the design
of telephone or other similar communication
              systems.
