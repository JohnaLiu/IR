              ABSTRACT

V. Bergelson and A. Leibman will study  multiple recurrence
              and
convergence in ergodic theory with emphasis on the polynomial aspects
              of
behavior.  The proposers earlier showed that sampling along polynomial
              times was suffient to reveal deep ergodic phenomina. The problems considered
              may be viewed
as far reaching extensions of classical results. In addition to
              demonstrating new properties of dynamical systems, these
problems lead
              naturally to strong applications of ergodic theory to combinatorics,
number
              theory and algebra which until now have been inaccessible
              conventional
methods. The polynomial Szemeredi theorem and the
              polynomial
Hales-Jewett theorem, obtained by the proposers in recent years,
              already serve as
an impetus for further developments in the theory of multiple
              recurrence.
This provides better understanding of 
multiple recurrence along
              polynomials and bring to light new vistas of research. An important feature of
              the research opened by the
proposers's earlier work is the appearance of
              nilpotent 
nilpotent groups into the picture.

Not only does 
this lead to
              strong applications in combinatorics and number
theory, but the computational
              flexibility stemming from this theory may be of significance in
              applications.
