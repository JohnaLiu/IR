The Chemistry Division award
              supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University
              of Arkansas for the summers of 2003-2005.  Donald R. Bobbitt is the site's
              program director. The co-PI of the project is David Paul.  Ten different
              research groups will provide research projects and mentoring for10 students for
              ten weeks.  Students will be recruited from an 8-state region with special
              efforts to attract women and minority students.  Research projects will involve
              a broad range of topics in chemistry and biochemistry.  The program will
              include professional training activities such as instrument training, report
              writing, research strategies, and a final meeting-in-miniature at which
              students will present short papers describing their results.
