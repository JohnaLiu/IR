Abstract    :
              A permanent educational tool (Chemical Structure Interactive Resource / CSIR)
              will be developed for students and researchers in molecular and solid state
              chemistry, and materials science and engineering.  It will encompass important
              structures in chemistry and provide tutorial modules for classroom teaching. 
              It will consist of a comprehensive web-based database of information relating
              to chemical and geometrical structure and their interrelationships with
              examples derived from chemical and biological systems.

CSIR may serve as a
              model for a new generation of web-based textbooks of high value to science and
              engineering researchers and educators.  Creative approaches to the development
              of web-based "super-textbooks" utilizing web-based resources that can be
              extensively cross-linked, interactive and intelligent is presently receiving
              global recognition.  The importance of this intellectual property will be very
              significant and of high value to the commercial sector.
