Abstract    :
              This proposal is for a conference to bring together researchers, curriculum
              developers, teachers and educational technologists interested in developing the
              potential for broad impact of dynamic geometry visualization technology in
              elementary and middle school mathematics classrooms.  The results of the
              conference will be disseminated through the publication and distribution of its
              proceedings, in printed, CD-ROM and Web format.
