The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in
              New York city will establish an REU site for earth and planetary sciences and
              astrophysics. The Museum's Division of Physical Sciences, which contains the
              research departments of Earth and Planetary Sciences (EPS) and Astrophysics,
              will supervise undergraduate students in experimental, observational,
              theoretical, and computational projects at the recently completed Rose Center
              for Earth and Space at AMNH. This REU site will collaborate with the
              long-standing REU program in biological sciences at AMNH. In addition to their
              research projects in EPS and astrophysics, the student participants will gain
              exposure to research techniques and philosophies in fields such as
              paleontology, genetics, and evolutionary biology, through jointly run
              orientation meetings, in-house workshops, biweekly informal discussions, and
              joint seminars. This twelve week program will host six students annually. The
              students will report on their work at the end of the summer, both in a written
              scientific paper and a 15-minute oral presentation in a multidisciplinary
              scientific symposium.
