Abstract    :
              The US/Japan Workshop on Urban Earthquake Hazard Reduction will be held March 23
              - 26, 2003 in Maui, Hawaii. It is being convened jointly by the Earthquake
              Engineering Research Institute and the Japan Institute of Social Safety Science
              (ISSS) and will focus on the complexity of urban disasters and their
              manifestations for emergency response, sheltering, loss of utilities, their
              economic and social impacts, and the recovery process.  Reflecting the
              complexity and interrelationship of factors in urban disasters, the
              participation is uniquely multidisciplinary, reflecting the diversity of
              knowledge and skills necessary to urban disaster preparedness, mitigation,
              response, relief and recovery.  

Previous workshops dealing with urban
              earthquake hazard reduction have reinforced the development of a strong bond
              between the research and professional communities in the United States and
              Japan and have encouraged collaborative relationships between US and Japan.
              This collaborative research has enriched the US science and engineering
              communities by introducing new perspectives and methods into research
              activities, ultimately providing new tools to professional engineers,
              architects, planners, and emergency managers.  It is anticipated that this
              workshop will further contribute to advances in research and practice and to
              our ability to better prepare for and respond to future earthquakes and other
              extreme events.
