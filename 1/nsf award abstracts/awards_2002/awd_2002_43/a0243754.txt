Abstract    :
              Hands-on research in Genomics and Computational Biology will bring 10
              participants recruited nationally from underrepresented groups to UGA, where
              they will interact with an established interdisciplinary team working on
              identifying biological circuits for fundamental processes and validating these
              biological circuits by fitting them to genomics data.  Since the discovery of
              DNA as the genetic material 60 years ago, biologists have been taking apart
              living systems on a finer and finer scale until we have been able to determine
              the complete genetic blueprint of many organisms.  The challenge of the new
              millennium is "reassembling the pieces", i.e., moving from genomes to life. 
              One approach to reassembling the pieces is to borrow a metaphor from computer
              science: the entire chemical reaction network describing what a cell does is a
              biological circuit.  The theme for this genomics and computational biology
              program is "computing life", i.e., identifying biological circuits for
              fundamental processes like carbon metabolism and validating these biological
              circuits by fitting them to genomics data describing what the cell is doing
              (i.e., RNA and protein profiling data) (PNAS 99: 16904-16909 (2002)).  For more
