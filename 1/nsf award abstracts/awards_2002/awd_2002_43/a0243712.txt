Abstract    :
              The proposal is a request for support to help cover the costs of organizing the
              2003 meeting of the Division of Particles and Fields of the American Physical
              Society. It will take place from April 5-8, 2003 in Center City, Philadelphia
              and on the University of Pennsylvania campus. The funds will be used entirely
              to support graduate students and young scientists who otherwise could not
              afford to attend the meeting.
