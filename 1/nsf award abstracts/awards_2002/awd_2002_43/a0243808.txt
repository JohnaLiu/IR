This proposal will enable a seven-member U.S. bioengineering
              team to visit Vietnam to conduct a needs assessment.  The team will be
              coordinated by Dr. Van Toi Vo, Tufts University, and will visit three
              universities in Vietnam: the University of Technology in Hanoi and in Ho Chi
              Minh City and Can Tho University in Hanoi.  The goal of the delegation is to
              assess general and specific needs in the field of bioengineering in Vietnam and
              to conduct site visits to key departments and laboratories.   The information
              gathered by this team will provide knowledge of the state of development of
              bioengineering in Vietnam.  The needs assessment team will identify and
              describe priority steps leading to the development of appropriate
              bioengineering research in Vietnam and cooperation between the U.S. and
              Vietnamese scientific communities.
