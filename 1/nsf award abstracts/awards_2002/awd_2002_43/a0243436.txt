Abstract    :
              
The focus of this research involves the use of Reciprocal Donor Acceptor
              Selectivity (RDAS) to carry out the production of oligosaccharides.  Using the
              method, differential double-glycosidations can be achieved.  The ability to
              lessen dependence on protecting groups and the ability of guiding a donor to a
              specific OH group give the method great potential for stereo-and regio-control
              in glycosidations.  The method could have a great impact on the current
              synthetic methodologies used for the preparation of branched-chain
              oligosaccharides

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program is supporting the research of Dr. Bert O. Fraser-Reid at the Natural
              Products and Glycotechnology Research Institute, Inc.   Dr. Fraser-Reid will
              focus his work on the synthesis of oligosaccahrides using the concept of
              donor/acceptor matching wherein the structure of a monosubstituted diol guides
              the reaction of the molecule with a second glycosidating agent to afford one of
              many possible oligosaccharides.  The work has great potential for broader
              impact in the field of synthetic carbohydrate chemistry.
