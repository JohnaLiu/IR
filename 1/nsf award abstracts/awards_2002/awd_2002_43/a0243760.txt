              Institution: University of Idaho		PI: McHale					 

A Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) involving the chemistry departments at the University of
              Idaho and Washington State University will involve 10 students (8 NSF
              supported) during the summers of 2003-2005.  This 10-week program will
              emphasize research topics in Green Chemistry which is defined as  "design of
              chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use and generation
              of hazardous substances".  Jeanne L. McHale (Idaho) is the site director and
              Sue B.Clark (WSU) is the co-PI.  Fourteen faculty from these institutions are
              available to supervise research projects encompassing subjects such as
              hazardous waste remediation, catalysis, solar energy conversion, and
              environmentally friendly synthesis.  The collaborating departments will
              maximize their available resources for research and promote more diverse
              approaches to chemical research.  Students will be recruited from regional
              colleges in the Pacific Northwest, which includes Washington, Idaho, Montana,
              Oregon, Alaska, and Wyoming. There will be an emphasis on attracting students
              from under-represented groups.  Weekly seminars on research and career issues
              will alternate between the schools.  A field trip will be taken to the Pacific
              Northwest National Laboratory.
