The submitted proposal is to request funds from the National
              Science Foundation in 
support of organizing the Optoelectronics Industry
              Development Association's (OIDA) 2002 Annual Forum. The object is to share
              information between academic researchers and industrialists, thus leading to
              timely feedback between the participants that will lead to increased
              industrially related fundamental research.  This integrated approach  will
              ensure seamless exchange  and optimal fulfillment of the needs of both industry
               and academia.  
 
NSF, DARPA, and OIDA will jointly sponsor the OIDA annual
              forum for the purpose of discussing industrial trends and needs, new technology
              breakthroughs and public policies with an audience consisting of
              industrialists, government policymakers  and academia. This extensive exchange
              of information will promote a smooth transition of technologies, adaptation of
              policies to meet the real needs of both industries and academia.  In addition,
              students in training will be given an early vision of their possible careers.
