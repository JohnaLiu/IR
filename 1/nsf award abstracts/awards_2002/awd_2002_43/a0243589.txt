Abstract    :
              The University of Minnesota continues operating a Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site.  The REU Site is affiliated with the U. of Minnesota
              Materials Research Science and Engineering Center.  Ten undergraduate students
              are recruited nationwide every year for a ten-week summer research experience. 
              Emphasis is placed on recruitment from four-year colleges, tribal colleges in
              the upper Midwest, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Hispanic
              Serving Institutions. Undergraduate students are involved in materials research
              projects that include microstructured polymers, crystalline organic
              semiconductors, and magnetic materials.  In addition, REU participants attend
              professional development workshops, research seminars and on-campus social
              events. 

The REU Site also includes a Research Experiences for Teachers
              (RET) component. Seven high school teachers are recruited every year for a
              five-week summer research experience, with an option for accompanying high
              school students for returning teachers.
