The principal investigator and his
              students will continue the investigation of the algebraic scructure of the
              Stone-Cech compactification of a discrete semigroup and its applications to
              Ramsey Theory.  Significant progress continues to be made in both areas, but
              much remains to be done.  Among the major algebraic problems which is still
              unsolved is whether there is a nontrivial continuous homomorphism from the
              Stone-Cech compactification of the positive integers to its remainder, N*. 
              That question can be stated equivalently as whether there is a finite
              subsemgroup of N* whose members are not all idempotents.

The proposed
              algebraic studies have significant potential applications to Ramsey Theory --
              that part of combinatorics which establishes the existence of highly regular
              substructures of given structures that are partitioned into finitely many
              classes (or "finitely colored").  One of the earliest applications of the
              algebra of the Stone-Cech compactification to Ramsey Theory was a simple proof
              of the following statement: If the positive integers are colored red and blue,
              then there is either a sequence all of whose sums (without repetition) are red
              or there is a sequence all of whose sums are blue.  Additional applications
              continue to be discovered.
