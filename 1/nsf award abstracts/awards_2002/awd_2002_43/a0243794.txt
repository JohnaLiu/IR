Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a summer internship program at University of
              Rhode Island's Graduate School of Oceanography (GSO) located in Narragansett,
              RI. This program has been active since 1986 and is called the Summer
              Undergraduate Research Fellowships in Oceanography (SURFO). Nine
              students/summer will participate in an eleven week research/education program
              that allows them to conduct independent research projects. The program aims to
              expose students who are majoring in math, physics, computer science and
              engineering to aspects of oceanographic research, and normally recruits rising
              Juniors with strong computational skills.  Students receive one-on-one research
              instruction from a faculty mentor.  They participate in a variety of
              educational activities, including an orientation session, a seminar series,
              field trips and several professional development workshops.  At the end of the
              summer, students prepare both an oral and a written presentation on their
              research.
