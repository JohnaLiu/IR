Abstract    :
              Purdue University continues operating a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              (REU) Site affiliated with its School of Materials Engineering. The REU Site
              research focuses on the processing and characterization of materials. Ten
              undergraduate students are recruited every year for a nine-week summer research
              experience. The REU site has a recruitment focus on students from institutions
              where there is little exposure to materials science and engineering as a
              discipline.  Students are involved in materials research that emphasizes
              processing of polymers, metals and ceramics, and their composites.  Students
              also attend departmental graduate research seminars, organized social
              activities and an end-of-summer research mini conference.
