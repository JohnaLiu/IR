Abstract    :
              This research site will lead undergraduate research programs in several areas of
              mathematics.  These areas include algebra, applied analysis, combinatorics,
              geometry, knot theory, financial mathematics and mathematical games.  For
              eight-week periods in each of the summers 2003-2005, students will work
              intensively in teams on appropriate research projects.  Results of successful
              projects will be published in peer-reviewed journals.  Women and minorities are
              encouraged to apply to the program.
