Description:  This award supports the US-India Cooperative
              Research: Development and Characterization of Conjugated Polymer Films Suitable
              for Photovoltaic Devices. 
US PI Jayant Kumar, University of Massachusetts
              Lowell and P.K. Bhatnagar, University of Delhi will study conjugated polymeric
              thin film solar cells with particular emphasis on material properties and
              material issues in device performance.  Polymer-Polymer, Polymer-Fullerene and
              Inorganic-Polymer solar cells will be developed using spin casting,
              electrostatic deposition and vacuum evaporation techniques.  The objective is
              to obtain interpenetrating homogenous nanostructure to improve the quality of
              the photovoltaic devices.    
Scope: The collaboration brings together the
              combined expertise of two active research groups in the area of photovoltaics. 
              The Indian group has expertise in design, fabrication and characterization in
              organic semiconductor solar cells; the US group has considerable experience in
              organic and conjugated polymer devices.   The interaction is expected to lead
              to synergistic advances in the development and application in environmentally
              attractive solar energy solutions with potential global benefits.  This
              research has a strong educational component in so far as it includes broad
              student participation.  This activity is funded by the Indian Department of
              Science & Technology (DST) under the NSF/DST joint program.
