Abstract    :
              SUNY-Buffalo establishes a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site
              with a research focus on the production, characterization and application of
              nanostructured semiconductors.  Twelve students are recruited nationwide every
              year for a ten-week interdisciplinary summer research experience.  The REU Site
              involves faculty mentors from the Chemical Engineering, Physics, Electrical
              Engineering and Chemistry Departments at SUNY-Buffalo. Students will
              participate in research projects within the areas of synthesis,
              characterization, modeling and applications of semiconductor nanostructures.
              Undergraduates also attend scientific and professional development seminars, a
              lecture series on research ethics, and participate in visits to high tech
              industries in the area and in organized social activities.
