Abstract    :
              The Physics Department of the University of California at Davis will host
              undergraduates for a summer research experience. The ultimate goal is to
              encourage students to continue studying physics through and beyond the college
              level. The program will give students views of physics not seen in typical
              coursework: first-hand experience of the joys and frustrations of research, and
              information about several types of physics careers.  The program will support
              ten students per year for the next three years, with half recruited from
              two-year and four-year colleges in northern California and the remainder
              recruited nationally from four-year colleges and universities. The heart of the
              program is a research project, supervised by one or more faculty members, in
              condensed matter physics, biophysics, geophysics, environmental physics,
              nuclear physics, high energy physics, or cosmology.  Supplementary activities
              will include introductory talks giving overviews of current physics research
              areas, lunch meetings to encourage discussion about the students' research
              projects, and visits to nearby national laboratories and industry to illustrate
              careers open to trained physicists.  The program will conclude with research
              presentations by the students, given at a combined session with another
              ten-student summer program aimed at science and engineering undergraduates from
              community colleges.
