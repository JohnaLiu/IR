Abstract    :
              The University of Illinois Department of Physics Research Experiences
              for
Undergraduates program provides research opportunities in a variety
              of
physics sub-fields.  About half of the participants are from colleges
              and
universities other than UIUC, and the other half are Illinois
              students
participating in our senior thesis course sequence, although
              all
participants are involved in the same activities.  Activities outside
              the
laboratory focus on communication skills and expose participants to a
              wide
variety of physics disciplines.  During the ten-week program, students
              are
required to give oral presentations and write a journal-style paper
              about
their research project.  Workshops are conducted on how to give
              effective
presentations, how to write a scientific paper, and ethical conduct
              of
research (new in Summer 2003).  Participants attend weekly lunch
              meetings
with a faculty member, who discusses recent progress and open
              problems in
his or her research area.  Optional social activities and field
              trips are
also arranged.
