This award funds a five-year Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Colorado Boulder for fifteen
              students each summer for research opportunities in the area of functional
              materials. The principal objective of this program will be to encourage
              promising students, particularly those from population groups underrepresented
              in research fields in engineering and those from primarily undergraduate
              institutions, to pursue graduate studies in preparation for a career in
              engineering research. The program will include (1) a student poster competition
              to encourage students to present their research at subsequent technical
              meetings; (2) a provision to pay travel expenses related to making
              presentations; (3) a recruiting strategy to improve student diversity that
              involves a partnership with CU-Boulder's Multicultural Engineering Program; (4)
              a seminar program that focuses on preparing students to do research; (5) a
              meaningful program of social and cultural activities designed to complement
              research activities; and (6) a program evaluation and follow-up survey to gauge
              the program's effectiveness. Students will conduct research targeted at the
              synthesis and characterization of novel materials with specified properties.
              The materials of interest will be aligned with the expertise of participating
              faculty and will include nanomaterials, biomaterials, catalysts, polymers,
              gels, ceramics, thin films, and membranes.
