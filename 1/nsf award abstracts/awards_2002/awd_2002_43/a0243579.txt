Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

The objective of this exploratory project is to develop and evaluate
              a system to extract, categorize, and analyze awards focused on nanoscale
              science and engineering.  The PI will explore methods based on knowledge data
              discovery techniques to advance the state-of-the-art for extracting, analyzing,
              understanding, and digesting information about a complex research area from
              large semi-structured data.  The areas of focus will be on discovery of topics
              and research trends and classification of data with respect to the topics under
              consideration.  For the test case, the abstracts of 250,000 NSF awards
              available on the web will be used as the overall data where both technical
              merit as well as broader impact will be analyzed.
