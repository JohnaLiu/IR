Abstract    :
              Professor Nongjian Tao of Arizona State University is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to fabricate atomic-scale metal wires
              with quantized conductance. Metal is deposited or etched electrochemically. 
              Electrochemical processes such as charge transport and adsorbate effects are
              studied.  This project focuses on relatively simple ions and redox molecules in
              electrolyes and their interaction with the nanowires.  Single ions and
              molecules are detected via tunneling currents as they trap in or escape from a
              molecular-scale gap.  

The project relates to the goals of miniaturizing
              electronics to molecular-size scale.  Students enjoy interdisciplinary training
              in electrochemistry and nanofabrication skills and benefit from close
              collaboration with Motorola.  The fabrication method from this lab has found
              applications in a number of labs around the world, making reliable single
              molecule measurements more available for development. Studies on solvation and
              ions are required to understand the characteristics of the nanowires in complex
              environments such as analytic samples and single biological cells.
