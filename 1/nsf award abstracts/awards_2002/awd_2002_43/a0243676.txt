Abstract    :
              The University of Pennsylvania continues operating a Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site. The REU Site is affiliated with the Materials
              Research Science and Engineering Center at Penn. Fifteen rising seniors and
              juniors are recruited nationwide every year for a ten-week summer research
              experience. Undergraduate students participate in a broad variety of materials
              research projects under the mentorship of over sixty faculty in nine science
              and engineering departments at Penn. In addition, REU participants attend
              weekly research seminars and organized social activities.
