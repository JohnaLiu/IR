Abstract    :
              The number of students trained in the area of information security and assurance
              is underrepresented to satisfy the needs. The goal of this proposal is to
              alleviate this problem by providing at Florida State University scholarship to
              students under the Federal Cyber Service. Florida State University:
     is an
              NSA (National Security Agency) Center of Excellence in Information Assurance
              Education.
     has been certified by the National Security Telecommunications
              and Information Systems Security (NSTISSC). The courses for information
              security professionals in the Department of Computer Science satisfy the
              NSTISSC 4011 standard. Students who have followed the appropriate courses at
              Florida State University can receive the corresponding certificate.
    
              courses in information security are also open to students of the FAMU/FSU
              college of
engineering.
     has 3 experts in Information Assurance on its
              staff
     has a $125,000 laboratory on Security and Assurance in Information
              Technology (SAIT) Laboratory where students become familiar with the practical
              aspects of information security.
     is clearly committed to continue growing
              this area.
