Abstract    :
              This 48-month project is a collaboration between AMNH and Lehman and Brooklyn
              Colleges of the City University of New York  (CUNY).  It fuses formal and
              informal learning experiences to support a Master's program for Earth Science
              teachers.  Ninety Master's program teachers will be recruited and sustained.
              Thirty school administrators will be engaged to support science instruction. 
              Two Earth Science courses for teachers will be designed and offered by Brooklyn
              and Lehman Colleges.  Two-week summer institutes at AMNH for teachers and
              administrators will serve as the required complements to the two courses.  The
              courses and institutes will provide 120 hours of professional development as
              part of their teacher education Master's program requirements.
