Abstract    :
              UT-Austin establishes a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site
              affiliated with its Physics Department. Thirteen students are recruited every
              year for a ten-week summer research experience. The research activity of the
              REU Site focuses on experimental condensed matter physics and on atomic,
              molecular and optical physics.  The condensed matter program includes
              experimental research on thin films, microstructures and nanotechnology, with
              emphasis on materials that exhibit strong electron correlation and mesoscopic
              behavior.  The atomic, molecular and optical physics program encompasses a
              range of research topics centered around the use of optical and/or electron
              based techniques to study and control matter.  In addition to participating in
              research projects, students attend research seminars and group social
              activities.
