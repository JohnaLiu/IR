This award supports a
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of North
              Texas (UNT) for the summers of 2003-2005.  Angela Wilson is the program
              director.  Thomas Cundari is the Co-PI of the project.  Twelve students will
              participate in a ten-week program.  The students will be recruited on a
              national basis with special focus on the ethnically diverse Arkansas,
              Louisiana, Texas region (ArkLaTex).  Thirteen problem areas are proposed for
              research in various fields of chemistry including organic, inorganic, physical,
              analytical, polymer and environmental chemistry.   The REU experience will be
              enhanced by discussions with chemical leaders on topics such as ethics,
              non-traditional career options and chemists in industry.   Training
              opportunities in computational chemistry and x-ray crystallography will be
              provided.   An external advisory board will be formed to assist and advise the
              REU program. The REU students will participate in activities with Mexican
              students, who are hosted each summer by the UNT chemistry department, providing
              an international dimension to their experience.
