Abstract    :
              This proposal from a University of Rochester group requests support to continue
              their studies within the CLEO collaboration working at the Cornell Electron
              Storage Rings (CESR) facility.
The group plans to improve the measurements of
              the photon energy spectrum in b -> sg, to study the exclusive and inclusive b->
              ulv decays and to study leptonic and semi-leptonic charm decays. These
              activities will lead to improved knowledge of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
              (CKM) matrix elements |Vub| and |Vcb| first directly and later indirectly by
              supplying information that aids in the interpretation of measurements at the
              B-factories, BaBar and Belle. It will also lead to improved knowledge of |Vcs|
              and |Vcd|, allowing precise tests of the unitarity of the CKM matrix.
