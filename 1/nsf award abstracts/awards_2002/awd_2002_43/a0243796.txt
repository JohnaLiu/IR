Abstract    :
              0243796 Scott Manalis Massachusetts Institute of Technology  Electric Detection
              of Protein Binding via Aptamer Functionalized Field-Effect
              Detectors

Recently, highly scalable electronic detection systems for DNA
              have been developed based on the molecule's intrinsic charge. Micrometer-scale
              field effect sensors, constructed using standard silicon microtechnology, were
              used to detect nanomolar DNA concentrations within minutes and to distinguish
              between oligonucleotides differing by a single base. Potential of tailor-made
              DNA and RNA aptamers for specifically capturing target proteins on the surface
              of a silicon field-effect sensor is being investigated under this project.  In
              collaboration with University of Texas at Austin, aptamers are designed to
              translate the aptamer-target complex into a modulation of surface charge at the
              sensor surface.  In addition, in collaboration with Molecular Sciences
              Institute, recognition molecules are being coupled to the sensor surface to
              electronically detect simulated biological agents.
