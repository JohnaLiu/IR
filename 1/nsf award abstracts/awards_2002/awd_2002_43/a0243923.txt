Abstract    :
              A ten-week summer program will be conducted for the next three years at the
              Montana State University in Bozeman.  The program consists of independent
              research projects carried out with a faculty mentor, a lecture series on solar
              physics, lectures by visiting scholars, an IDL (Interactive Data Language)
              primer course, a selection of social activities, and web-publication of final
              reports.  The program will accept six participants each summer, targeting
              undergraduates based in physics, mathematics and computer science, and it
              specifically encourages the participation of women and minorities.  This effort
              will run in parallel with a similar NSF REU program in solid state physics, and
              the American Indian Research Opportunities (AIRO) program for Native American
              high school students and teachers.  Since solar physics is being taught at
              relatively few colleges and universities, this program, with its strong Space
              Weather component, has the double benefit to society of adding to our
              understanding of the subject while training potential future researchers.
