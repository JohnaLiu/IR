This award funds a three-year Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site at the Western Transportation Institute at Montana
              State University for research opportunities for undergraduate students in rural
              transportation research. Eight undergraduate students will be selected each
              summer to participate in a ten-week residential program. Students will present
              their research results at the end of the program at an in-house symposium and
              will produce a written report on their results. This summer REU program will
              provide students from diverse backgrounds the opportunity to engage in current
              research topics relevant to improving rural transportation. The program aims to
              increase students' awareness of the breadth of rural transportation issues and
              promote fundamental scientific understanding of the importance of innovative
              transportation research. The program is designed to improve students' research,
              collaborative, and professional skills in order to address the nation's need
              for innovative researchers and professionals capable of developing creative
              long-term solutions to complex rural transportation issues. This REU Site is
              supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU
              Program.
