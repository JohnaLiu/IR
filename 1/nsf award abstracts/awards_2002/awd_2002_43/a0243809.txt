This award provides support to Washington University to
              establish a three-year International Research Experience for Undergraduates
              (REU) Site in Japan titled "Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Japan in
              Advanced Technology (REUJAT). Nine students each year will have an opportunity
              to do research in the area of advanced technologies for the detection and
              mitigation of damage to civil engineering structures subjected to severe
              dynamic loading as a result of events like earthquakes, hurricanes, and blasts.
              The REU site is designed as a summer experience with five weeks spent in Japan
              at the University of Tokyo and 3 to 4 weeks in the U.S. at the students' home
              institution. In addition to research, relevant technical tours and
              cultural/social events are planned. Undergraduate engineering students from
              across the U.S. will be recruited for the REUJAT program.
