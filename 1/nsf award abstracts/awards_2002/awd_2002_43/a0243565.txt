Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for the renewal of a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates Site in Political Science at Duke University. The program,
              called the Ralph Bunche Summer Institute, was initiated by the American
              Political Science Association in 1986. NSF joined in funding the program in
              1997. The program is designed to expand opportunities for students of color by
              preparing them to enroll in doctoral degree programs. Twenty black, Latino, and
              American Indian undergraduates will be immersed in a five-week intensive
              program that includes graduate level course work, and the design, analysis,
              write-up, and presentation of original research papers. The program simulates
              the graduate school experience and focuses on scientific analysis by
              introducing the students to research methods and statistics, and the research
              enterprise that is the lifeline of professional political scientists. 
              Additional program seminars cover professional development topics such as GRE
              preparation and a graduate school recruitment fair.  This program also includes
              an ethics component.

This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing
              efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active
              undergraduate research experiences.
