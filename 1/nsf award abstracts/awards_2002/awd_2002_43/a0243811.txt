Abstract    :
              The College of Wooster continues operating a Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) site. The REU Site is affiliated with the Physics
              Department at Wooster; its research theme is condensed matter physics and
              nonlinear dynamics. Eight students are recruited every year for a ten-week
              summer research experience, with a recruitment focus on students from
              predominantly undergraduate institutions. Students participate in research that
              includes projects on critical phenomena in liquid mixtures, pattern formation,
              liquid crystals, cellular automata and chaos in celestial mechanics. Students
              also attend local research seminars, regional and/or national research
              conferences, and organized social activities.
