Abstract    :
              This ten-week REU Site will provide a research opportunity for 9 students in
              cultural anthropology.  The first five weeks of the program will be spent on
              instruction in fundamental cultural anthropology research techniques, and the
              second five weeks will be spent conducting individual research projects. 
              Students will be trained in four major areas of cultural anthropology research:
              historical and testimonial case studies, participant observation, qualitative
              data analysis on text-interview material, and quantitative analysis of census
              and survey data.  Students will also be taught the techniques and critical
              thinking skills necessary for conducting resource material location, library
              research, and the use of the Internet for research purposes.

Throughout the
              ten weeks, students are exposed to such topics as: writing research results,
              stages of research, critical thinking, note-taking during research, getting
              published, and presenting at conferences.  Students also participate in an
              ethics seminar and the UNT McNair Scholars' Friday Seminars.
This award
              contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students
              into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.
