Abstract    :
              This highly interdisciplinary symposium will bring together scientists from
              academia and industry to discuss the significant advances and opportunities in
              designing, producing, and using materials that are inspired by biology.  The
              topics of the symposium will include polymeric materials, colloidal systems,
              and inorganic materials with applications ranging from photonic band gap
              materials to bone engineering.  

Because the organizers plan to target at
              least 25% of the talks (oral and poster) to be given by graduate students and
              postdoctoral fellows, and others by young faculty, this symposium will provide
              an excellent opportunity for these young scientists to establish academic
              and/or industrial collaborations.
