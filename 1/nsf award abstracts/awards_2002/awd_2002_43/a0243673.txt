Abstract    :
              This 10-week summer research program is aimed at involving 8 undergraduate
              students in active research 
under the supervision of applied mathematicians
              who are dedicated researchers and mentors. The major area 
of concentration
              will be applied mathematics emphasizing population dynamics and wave
              propagation in nonhomogeneous media. At the end of the summer program the
              students will have developed a good understanding of mathematical modeling,
              interpretation of solutions to explain the underlying physical problems,
              dependence of solutions on the parameters used in the models, inverse problems
              and their importance.

The primary focus of the REU site project is
              mathematical training, active participation in research, and mentoring.  The
              objectives are to provide the undergraduate students with meaningful research
              experience in applied mathematics, to show them the enjoyment of doing
              research, to encourage them to pursue advanced degrees in mathematics, science,
              and engineering, and to increase participation by women and other
              
underrepresented groups. There will be various scientific, cultural, and
              social activities enhancing the program and helping to improve the students'
              computational and communication skills.
