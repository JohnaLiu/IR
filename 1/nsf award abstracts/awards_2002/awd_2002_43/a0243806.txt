"Dynamical Systems, Denton 2003"

This award provides
              substantial support for active research
mathematicians (both advanced and
              beginning) with limited means of
support to attend and participate in the
              conference Dynamical Systems,
Denton 2003. The conference is designed  to
              provide an opportunity for
leading experts in the fields of ergodic theory,
              topological dynamics,
smooth dynamical systems, holomorphic dynamical systems,
              one-dimensional
dynamics, combinatorial ergodic theory and Hamiltonian
              dynamical systems
to share their ideas with the research community. With only
              a
single speaker scheduled at any given time, the conference will also
give
              less renowned speakers and their ideas exposure to a wide audience.
The
              plenary speakers will be Krystyna Kuperberg, Carlangelo Liverani,
Rafael de la
              Llave Michael Lyubich and Lai-Sang Young.
