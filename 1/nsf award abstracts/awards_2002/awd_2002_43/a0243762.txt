This award provides renewed funding for a summer
              internship program at the Bermuda Biological Station for Research (BBSR). This
              program has been active since 1991. BBSR brings eight undergraduate students to
              Bermuda to conduct independent research projects within the framework of
              ongoing oceanography and marine biology research programs. It is one of two
              OCE-funded REU sites that is conducted during the regular academic year,
              bringing students to BBSR for three months in the Fall. The students also
              participate in a series of lectures, formal and informal seminars, fieldtrips,
              and an oceanographic cruise.
