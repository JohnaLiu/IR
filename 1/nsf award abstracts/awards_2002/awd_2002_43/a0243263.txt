Abstract    :
              The proposal is to support the attendance and participation of graduate students
              in the Fifth International Conference on Boiling Heat Transfer in May of 2003. 
              This is a well-established conference that involves the most productive
              researchers presenting the most advanced work in the field of boiling.  The
              topic continues to be crucially important in the thermal transport arena,
              especially in the areas of microscale phenomena.  The proposed participation of
              14 students wll be restricted to currently enrolled graduate students attending
              universities in the United States who are co-authors of a paper being presented
              at the conference.  The requested support will help to promote the goals of the
              conference through NSF participation.  It will also foster the professional
              development of the next generation of boiling and two-phase flow researchers in
              the thermal transport community.
