Abstract    :

              Institution and Mechanical College

This award supports a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Louisiana State University &
              Agricultural Institution and Mechanical College for the summers of 2003-2005. 
              It will provide research opportunities and supplementary training and
              enrichment for 16 minority students from Louisiana institutions primarily, and
              Mississippi and Texas.  Frank K. Cartledge is the program director.  Cheryle
              Peters is co-PI of the project.  REU students representing all STEM areas will
              be recruited.  The research will have an environmental theme. Faculty mentors
              from the departments of chemistry, mathematics, computer science, biological
              sciences, physics, various engineering disciplines and agronomy will provide a
              wide spectrum of research projects.   Participants will attend a short computer
              course, explore research ethics, and attend seminars dealing with technical
              writing, graduate school and oral communication skills.  All students will
              present their results by the end of the summer at an LSU poster conference. 
              This program will cooperate with others that are ongoing at LSU, including the
              NSF-supported Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation (LAMP) and the NSF
              and Howard Hughes REU summer research programs in Chemistry, Biochemistry, and
              Chemical Engineering.  This REU site is funded by the Division of Chemistry and
              the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematics
              and Physical Sciences, and the Division of Human Resource Development in the
              Directorate for Education and Human Resources.
