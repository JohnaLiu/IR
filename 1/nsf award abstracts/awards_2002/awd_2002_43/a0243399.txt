Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for the 2003 Annual Conference of the
              National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP) and Black Physics Students, which
              will be held at Spellman College, Atlanta, GA on February 12-15, 2003.  This
              will be the 17th Annual Conference, bringing together students and
              professionals for both concurrent and parallel sessions.  The NSBP seeks to
              increase the diversity of the United State community of researchers and
              educators in physics and related fields by providing student participants with
              the motivation and practical skills to further their education and assimilation
              into the scientific and technical professions. The Annual Conference is
              attended by approximately 250 students, and is supported by a combination of
              gifts from foundations, national laboratories, industry, federal grants, and
              support from the host institution. This award will provide direct support for
              the attendance of approximately 50 undergraduate or graduate students,
              post-doctoral associates, or junior physics faculty.  Past meetings have
              demonstrated a strong synergy in bringing together students and career physics
              professionals.  This is a natural format leading to new contacts, networks and
              mentoring opportunities for student attendees.
