This award funds a three-year Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Michigan. The program will
              provide meaningful research opportunities for eight undergraduates in
              mechanical engineering for a ten-week period each summer. The program's
              research focus is on improving exhaust emissions systems; assessing alternative
              fuel utilization in engines; using computer models to predict engine
              performance and validation through experiments; and understanding complex
              engine combustion processes and impact on engine performance. Students involved
              in experimental projects will be exposed to and have opportunities to use some
              of the modern instrumentation in combustion and engine research. The program
              addresses important and timely issues in pollutant emission control and
              alternative/efficient energy usage. Students will participate in seminars on
              ethics and the values of ethics in research. The primary goal of the program is
              to provide a meaningful research experience to undergraduate students in
              preparation for research careers in engineering. Students will be recruited
              from colleges and universities across the United States, with directed efforts
              at attracting students from population groups underrepresented in research
              fields in engineering in the United States.
