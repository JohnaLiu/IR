Abstract    :
              The Laboratory for Elementary-Particle Physics (LEPP) at Cornell
University
              will provide 10 undergraduates with the excitement and challenge 
of frontier
              research and with opportunities to acquire new skills and
meet researchers at
              all stages of their careers.  The constellation of
programs includes
              elementary particle physics (part of the CLEO
Collaboration, studying
              fundamental questions of the weak and
strong forces), accelerator physics
              (using the CESR electron-positron storage
ring), synchrotron radiation science
              (both using the the existing x-ray
facility - CHESS - and designing new
              facilities) and microwave
superconductivity.  The selected students will work
              closely with LEPP physicists and 
participate in seminars, lectures, tours of
              campus facilities, and
activities designed to promote interactions among the
              many undergraduate
researchers at Cornell.  Travel and housing allowances are
              given in addition
to a summer stipend.
