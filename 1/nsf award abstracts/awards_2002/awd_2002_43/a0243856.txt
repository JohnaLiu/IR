Abstract    :
              This research project examines the structure of the free aqueous interface,
              water surfaces in contact with hydrophobic layers, the aqueous interface in the
              presence of molecular ions and sulfur-containing adsorbates, as well as the
              interaction of biomolecular species at the oil/water interface.  With the
              support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Richmond and
              her collaborators at the University of Oregon are carrying out experimental and
              computational studies of these complex and important systems.  Vibrational sum
              frequency spectroscopy, in combination with molecular dynamics simulations, is
              used to obtain structural and dynamic information about the liquid/liquid and
              liquid/vapor interface in these studies.  The fundamental understanding
              obtained in these studies is of importance in a variety of chemical process,
              environmental, and biological contexts.

With the support of the Analytical
              and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Richmond is examining the structure
              and dynamics of aqueous interfaces.  Vibrational spectroscopic information
              obtained using sum frequency generation and molecular dynamics simulations
              provide an understanding of these important interfaces. Results of this work
              are relevant to a broad range of environmental, chemical, and biological
              processes involving the water interface.
