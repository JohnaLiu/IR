Abstract    :
              This proposal is a request for support to help cover the costs of organizing the
              conference "20 Years of SUGRA". It will take place from March 17-20, 2003 in
              Boston Massachusetts on the Northeastern University Campus. The funds will be
              used entirely to support graduate students, Post-docs and junior faculty who
              otherwise could not afford to attend the meeting.
