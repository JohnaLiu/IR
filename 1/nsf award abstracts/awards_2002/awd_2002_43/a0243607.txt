Abstract    :
              Opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in ongoing research 
              projects in experimental physics are structured in a summer REU program.   
              Students may choose from a wide variety of forefront physics activities,  under
              the direction of senior faculty members from the Department of  Physics at the
              University of Arizona, or also from in research groups  located in several
              other university academic units including Astronomy,  Optical Sciences, Lunar
              and Planetary Studies, and Atmospheric  Sciences. 

The primary source of
              participants is students who have completed the equivalent of the first or
              second year curriculum in science or engineering at the community college
              level, in preparation for transfer to a 4-year degree program. The 10-week
              program will support 12 students each summer. Graduate teaching assistants from
              the physics department serve as mentors. Special orientation and skills
              activities are individually tailored during the first two weeks of the program,
              which enhance the ability of the participants to make significant contributions
              to the research projects. Weekly participant meetings include interim oral
              reports and lead to a formal presentation and final written report.
