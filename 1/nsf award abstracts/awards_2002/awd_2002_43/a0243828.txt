The Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates (REU) site at Hope College for the summers of 2003-2006. 
              The site director is Joanne L. Stewart.  Ten students and twelve faculty
              research mentors will participate in a ten/eleven week program.  Half of the
              students will be recruited from Hope College and half from other colleges and
              universities.  The proposed research projects cover a broad range of both
              chemistry and biochemistry topics.  The program will develop professional
              skills, especially oral and written communication skills, through seminars,
              reports, and presentation of a poster at an end-of-summer research symposium. 
              Evaluation of the program will be conducted by the chemistry department as well
              as by participation in a larger outside evaluation program involving several
              undergraduate institutions.
