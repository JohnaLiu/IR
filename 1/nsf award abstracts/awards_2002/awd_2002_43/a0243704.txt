The Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site at Marshall University for the summers of 2003-2005. 
              Seth Bush is the site's program director.  Eleven faculty from the chemistry
              departments at Marshall University and West Virginia State College will serve
              as student mentors to 8 students each summer for ten weeks.  Students will be
              recruited from the Appalachian geographic area and from a larger national pool
              in roughly equal numbers.  Research projects are offered in the area of
              chemistry having a biochemical orientation.  Participants will develop a broad
              range of practical scientific laboratory skills such as synthesis, instrumental
              analysis and computation.  Students will prepare a proposal, an oral progress
              report and a final poster session.  The research experience will be evaluated
              by exit interviews and long term tracking of participants.
