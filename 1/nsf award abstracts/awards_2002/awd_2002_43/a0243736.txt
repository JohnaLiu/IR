Title:  A Computer Science REU for Tribal College
              Students

This project supports an REU Site that provides a summer research
              experience for students from Montana's tribal colleges, with the intention of
              encouraging participants to continue their education at a university after
              completion of their two- or four-year current degrees.  The REU program
              supports eight students per year; six in the summer program, and two
              year-round.  The students work on the graphics and visualization components of
              a five-state precision agriculture project, interacting not only with the PI of
              this REU proposal (who is graphics and visualization team leader for the
              precision agriculture project) but also with researchers and producers
              associated with the project.  The participants are immersed in 3D graphics and
              programming, usually for the first time.
