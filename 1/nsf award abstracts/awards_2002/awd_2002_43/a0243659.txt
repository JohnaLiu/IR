This REU site at the University of
              Texas, Austin will expose students to environmental science.  Twelve faculty
              from four departments (chemistry, geological sciences, integrative biology,
              pharmacy) will be the research mentors.  All faculty are members of the
              Environmental Science Institute.  The research projects will develop expertise
              in a traditional area of science while uniting with other disciplines to attack
              complex problems.  Eight to nine students will be involved in 10 weeks of
              research and associated activities.  The recruiting emphasis will focus on
              students from undergraduate institutions mainly from Texas that have a high
              proportion of students from historically underrepresented backgrounds,.  A
              secondary theme of the site is "science communication".  Students will interact
              with a technical writer.  They will prepare articles for a "discovery" type
              magazine and a poster for a poster session at the end of the summer.  The
              students will also engage in three "field study" scientific excursions to
              introduce them to non-laboratory based scientific endeavors.
