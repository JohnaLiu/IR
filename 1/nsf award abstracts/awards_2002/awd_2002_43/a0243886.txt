Abstract    :
              Stanford University continues operating a Research Experience for Undergraduates
              (REU) Site.  The REU Site is affiliated with a multi-institutional Materials
              Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) which includes, in addition to
              Stanford, UC-Davis, UC-Berkeley, and IBM-Almaden Research Center.  The MRSEC
              research focuses on polymer interfaces and macromolecular assemblies. Eighteen
              undergraduate students are recruited nationwide with a recruitment focus on
              undergraduates from two-year and four-year institutions, as well as members
              form underrepresented groups.  Students are involved in research in polymer
              science at all four US institutions, as well as at some of the industrial
              affiliates laboratories and at collaborating institutions in Germany.  In
              addition, REU students participate in professional development and group social
              activities.

The REU Site includes a Research Experience for Teachers (RET)
              component. Four teachers are recruited every year for an 8-week summer research
              experience
