Abstract    :
              Jason Halfen, University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire Department of Chemistry,
              is
supported for his project making new synthetic analogs for
              superoxide
reductase enzymes. This family of enzymes has a non-heme iron
              active site in
a square pyramidal geometry. By preparing small molecule models
              of this
active site, we can better understand the bonding and
              three-dimensional
structure, redox chemistry and reactivity of the enzyme.
              More specifically,
Halfen will be preparing and studying thiolate-ligated iron
              and cobalt
peroxo species, the propensity of the model complexes to dissociate
              these
thiolates, and representative sulfur alkylation and oxidation
              reactions.

This award is made under the Research in Undergraduate
              Institutions (RUI)
Program and incorporates undergraduate education and
              training. The range of
synthetic and spectroscopic techniques proposed will
              provide a foundation
for undergraduate students pursuing chemistry or biology
              as a career. The
scientific impact will include a better understanding of
              metal-thiolate
bonds and how these ubiquitous bonds are involved in enzymatic
              processes.
