Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at Tulane University is hosting 8 weeks long
              summer research program for undergraduates;summers of 2003-2005.  The research
              area includes geometry and topology.There will be 12 students working with 3
              Department of Mathematics members(Prof. M.Kalka,Prof.  S.Kwasik and Prof.
              D.Yang) .  Topics of the research will be adapted to students
              background,interest and preparation.  Students will receive a stipend,housing
              in the dormitories of Tulane University and travel assistance
