Abstract    :
              This Exploratory Grant for Exploratory Research will provide support
for the
              fabrication of components of a forward pion detector (FPD)
to be installed in
              the STAR detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven
              National Laboratory in anticipation of
the 2003 experimental run.  Measurement
              of neutral pion production
by transversely polarized proton beams can provide
              to our knowledge
of the gluon distribution in the proton.  Preliminary runs
              with
simple detectors have produced results which motivate the
              present
design, and narrow equipment installation windows at RHIC
              have
contributed a time urgency to this project.
