Abstract    :
              This is a transfer of funds to the U.S. Air Force Rocket Systems Launch Program
              for the launch of the COSMIC satellite constellation.  COSMIC is a
              constellation of six satellites that will make use of recent developments in
              remote sensing, communications technology, and computing to solve some of the
              most important geo-scientific issues today.  Each spacecraft will carry three
              science payloads for weather and space weather research and prediction, climate
              monitoring, and geodesy.  These payloads are 1) GPS occultation receiver 2)
              Tiny Ionospheric Photometer (TIP) and 3) Tri Band Beacon Transmitters (TBB). 
              The COSMIC system includes the low earth orbit satellites, ground data
              reception and spacecraft control stations, data analysis centers and the data
              communications networks.
