This proposal requests
              continuing support for the publication of D-Lib Magazine.  D-Lib is only
              published on the World Wide Web, and is widely considered the most influential
              and respected source of information on digital libraries today. It has proven
              to be an especially effective forum and promoter of scientific communication
              and dialogue across a broad spectrum of IT, disciplinary and education
              issues.
