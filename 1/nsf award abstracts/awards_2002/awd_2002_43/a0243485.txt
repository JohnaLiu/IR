Abstract    :
              This is a comprehensive, national, 5-year project to develop a system for
              fostering sustainable partnerships between ocean science researchers, teachers
              and professional scientist-educators.  Partners in the collaboration include: 
              The University of Rhode Island Graduate school of Oceanography, the Joint
              Oceanographic Institutions, the Consortium for Oceanographic Research and
              Education and the Jason Foundation.  The goals of: 1) fostering SMT teacher
              retention and renewal through pedagogy and content training, research
              experiences and mentoring activities, and 2) to advance and sustain the
              integration of the ocean science research enterprise with the K-12 education
              will be achieved through: 1) Training and Research; 2) Mentoring New Teachers;
              3) An ARMADA Framework and Resource Dissemination.  Each year twelve Master
              Teachers (MT) will join the ARMADA.  Each MT will subsequently mentor two new
              teachers for two years.  There are a total of 216 participants.  A one-week
              preparation workshop will precede the ship-based summer research experience. 
              This will be followed by active participation in a 10-20-day summer ocean
              science research experience.  Structured sessions for ARMADA teachers at
              professional meetings, such as NSTA, will strengthen the professional learning
              community of teachers interested in oceanographic research and education.
