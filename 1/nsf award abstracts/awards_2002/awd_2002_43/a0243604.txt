Abstract    :
              Eight undergraduate students with a solid background in mathematics will be
              selected to participate in a seven week Research Experience for Undergraduates
              to be held at the University of Wisconsin in Madison in the summer of 2003. 
              The students will be exposed to specific questions in Number Theory involving
              elliptic curves, modular forms, orthogonal polynomials, and L-functions. The
              selected students will be offered up to $400 in travel support, free lodging,
              and a stipend of $3200.

The students will be divided into two teams. One
              team will study orthogonal polynomials and their connection to supersingular
              elliptic curves, while the other will study generating functions for values of
              L-functions that are obtained by specializing the Fourier expansion of modular
              forms and various combinatorial q-series.
