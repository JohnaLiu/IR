Abstract    :
              The University of South Florida establishes an interdisciplinary Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site focusing on the modeling, synthesis
              and characterization of nanomaterials. Twelve students are recruited every year
              for ten-week summer research experience.  Eight professors from the Departments
              of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical
              Engineering serve as research advisors. Students participate in research
              projects with a focus on molecular science and its applications in
              nanotechnology, including theoretical modeling, synthesis, characterization and
              applications of nanomaterials. Students also attend workshops on
              instrumentation, patenting and licensing, ethics in research, tours of local
              high tech companies, and group social activities.
