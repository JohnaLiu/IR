The Chemistry
              Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at
              the University of North Dakota (UND) for the summers of 2003-2005.
Evguenii
              Kozliak is the site's program director and Michael Mann from the Department of
              Chemical Engineering is the Co-Director.  Scientists and engineers of the
              Center for Gas and Gas-Solid Interactions Impacting the Environment (CIGSIIE),
              Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Space Studies will serve as REU mentors to
              eight students, who will each participate in a ten-week program.  Students will
              be recruited from colleges in the Upper Midwest, with particular attention to
              Native Americans and first generation students resident in the rural
              communities of the upper Midwest and Western states.  Fifteen research projects
              are described in the area of gas-phase chemistry and related environmental
              chemistry.  Students will conclude the program with a poster presentation at a
              statewide meeting.  The Office of Instructional Development at UND will
              evaluate the REU site.
