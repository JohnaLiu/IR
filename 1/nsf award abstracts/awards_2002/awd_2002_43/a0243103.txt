Abstract    :
              Forming engineered nanostructures is a major challenge in the field
              nanotechnology. There is a general agreement that such structures should be
              formed by self assembly, in contrast to controlled lithographic approach
              adopted in MEMS and micro electronics. In this project, we intend to form self
              assembled nano-wires, and investigate the underlying mechanics that govern the
              self assembly. We have shown experimentally that plasma deposited silicon
              di-oxide may crack when annealed due to residual stress. We successfully formed
              nano wires by simply depositing (electroless) Nickel in the cracks.
Nickel
              bonds with the substrate and forms wires with lateral dimension of around
              100nm. The length of the wires can be several micro meters. Thus a network of
              self-assembled nanowires is obtained. In this one-year project, we plan to
              study the parameters that govern the dimension of the wires in order to reduce
              their width to 20nm. The electrical and mechanical properties will also be
              investigated to explore any size effect due to confinement. The study may have
              a considerable impact on the field of nano-electronics, and will enhance
              fundamental understanding of the mechanical behavior of nano-wires and their
              transport properties.
