Proposal: CHE-0243921					Date: 1-17-2003
Institution: State
              University of West Georgia		                PI: Ray					 

The Department of
              Chemistry at the State University of West Georgia will be the site for a
              Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program during the summers of
              2003-2005.  Gigi B. Ray is the site director and Victoria Geisler is co-PI.  
              The site will host 9 students (8 NSF supported) for ten weeks.  The West
              Georgia REU program is designed to give two-year college students from across
              the Southeast a research experience.  Approximately two-thirds of the
              participants are targeted from two-year colleges. The students will have the
              opportunity to participate in research in analytical, biological,
              computational, inorganic, and physical chemistry.  Nine research projects in
              these areas, some involving collaborative efforts between the faculty members,
              are proposed for investigation.  The intellectual focus will be a hands-on
              research experience supplemented with weekly seminars, workshops, field trips
              to regional research centers, and student presentations of their work.
