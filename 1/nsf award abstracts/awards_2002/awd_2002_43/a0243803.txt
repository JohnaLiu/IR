This award funds a five-year Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Maryland for fifteen students
              each summer for twelve weeks for research opportunities at the university's
              Institute for Systems Research.  Students at colleges, universities, and
              community colleges will be recruited nationwide through a process involving
              efforts to reach students who would otherwise not have access to a research
              experience.  The program incorporates activities that will involve participants
              in the following research directions of the institute: global communications
              systems, sensor-actuator networks, next-generation product realization systems,
              societal infrastructure systems, and cross-disciplinary systems education.
              Through the program students will be able to (1) establish a basis for systems
              thinking by conducting research and thus understand systems engineering as a
              discipline; (2) acquire broader and deeper understanding of both the research
              process and the practice of engineering and how new knowledge is created and
              communicated; (3) develop multicultural understanding and team competence and
              become aware of the societal implications of research; and (5) successfully
              seek admission in a four-year program and/or graduate school.
