Abstract    :
              The research of this project focuses on developing models that address the
              interface between product variety/architecture and production/supply chain
              management.  With a series of interrelated optimization models that draw on the
              literatures of product design, operations management, marketing and economics,
              we seek to: (a) quantitatively evaluate the effect of production and supply
              chain capabilities on product variety decisions, (b) develop principles for
              matching product platform architectures to various production and market
              environments, and (c) construct methods for dynamically evolving a
              production/supply chain system to support a product family in a web-enabled,
              collaborative customization design environment.

The core of the research
              will focus on using discrete choice theory to represent consumer preferences
              and modern supply chain theory to characterize support costs.  Research will
              focus on discrete choice theory instead of the more traditional approach of
              using a location model to represent customer decisions because it is more
              compatible with conjoint analysis techniques from marketing, and hence is more
              likely to yield results relevant to practice.  The models will first address
              product families containing horizontally differentiated variants and will then
              move to more complex product architectures involving modules and vertically
              differentiated variants.  Similarly, the models will begin by optimizing the
              product variety decision from the perspective of a single firm, but will
              ultimately consider environments in which variety decisions are an important
              part of competitive market strategy.
