This award to University of California San Diego's Scripps
              Institution of Oceanography provides support for a development to significantly
              upgrade a hydrographic Doppler sonar system on R/V Roger Revelle, which will
              expand the oceanographic research capabilities of the ship which is as part of
              the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.
               It is expected that the upgrade development here will extend the depth to
              which the sonar can profile ocean currents from the moving research vessel, and
              serve as a template for other systems. This upgrade should provide a
              substantial advantage to marine scientists using the ship in their research
              during 2003 and future years.
