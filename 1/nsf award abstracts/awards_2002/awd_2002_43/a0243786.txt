The award
              supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University
              of California, Santa Cruz for the summers of 2003-2005.  Rebecca Braslau is the
              program director.  Nine students will carry out research with faculty and
              research groups in the chemistry department over a ten-week period. 
              Undergraduate students with limited opportunities for research at their home
              institutions will be targeted, while striving to achieve a broad representation
              of minorities, women and students with disabilities.  The research projects
              span many multiple disciplines ranging from organic, bioorganic, bioinorganic,
              physical and biophysical chemistry.  Many of the projects are interdisciplinary
              in nature.  The students will also participate in a weekly series of research
              seminars presented by graduate students in the department.  They will give a
              mid-summer progress report.  At the end of the summer program each participant
              will prepare a journal style research report of their project and present a
              final seminar in a research colloquium.
