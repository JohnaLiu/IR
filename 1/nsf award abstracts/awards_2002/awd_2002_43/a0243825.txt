The Chemistry Division award supports a
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Loyola University of
              Chicago for the summers of 2003-2005.  Mary K Boyd is the program director. 
              Faculty members from the chemistry department will serve as REU mentors to nine
              students, who will participate in a ten-week program.  Students from two-year
              colleges, women and underrepresented minorities will be targeted for
              participation in the program.  Research projects from across the department
              will be available to the participants including analytical, biological,
              organic, bioorganic, computational and physical chemistry.  Weekly seminars
              will be held focusing on research areas, their relevance to real world
              problems, career opportunities in chemistry, and ethics.  Each student will
              prepare a written report and give an oral report of their work in a Student
              Symposium at the end of the summer program.
