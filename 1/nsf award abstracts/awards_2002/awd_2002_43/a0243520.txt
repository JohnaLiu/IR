The objective of
              this project is the development of strategies for searching for the best
              materials property using combinatorial techniques coupled with Monte Carlo
              methods.  The techniques to be developed are aimed at improving on the current
              grid search methods, which are often cumbersome to employ.  Monte Carlo
              strategies are expected to provide significant improvement, and the ability to
              incorporate a priori knowledge should further improve the search strategy. 
              Several variables can be manipulated in order to seek the material with the
              optimal figure of merit.  Variables such as composition as well as film
              thickness and deposition method can be investigated.  The work will focus on
              the theoretical aspects of the problem.  Virtual libraries and materials will
              be constructed, and the Random Phase Volume model will be used to assess the
              validity of the methods.  Techniques developed will be applied to data
              generated by an industrial collaborator.  A wide range of improved material
              properties such as superconductivity, magnetoresistance or catalytic activity
              have been sought using combinatorial methods.  The overall goal of
              high-throughput methods is to hasten discovery for improved processes and
              materials properties.
