Abstract    :
              James Madison University (JMU) will host an eight-week Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) program for eight undergraduates per year during the
              summers of 2003-2005.  The primary goal of the
program is to provide its
              student participants with an authentic mathematical research experience.  The
              components of program include: (1) Working with another student on a research
              project with a faculty
mentor; (2) Writing a research paper containing project
              results; (3) Participating in a common seminar; (4) Presenting results to the
              other research groups throughout the program; (4) Participating in a
              poster
session with students in the REU programs at JMU in Biology, Chemistry,
              and Materials Science; (5) The opportunity to visit industrial research
              facilities in the DC area; (6) The opportunity to attend the seminars in
              Biology, Chemistry, and Materials Science; (7) Participating in social
              activities with undergraduate research students in Biology, Chemistry, and
              Materials Science; (8) Having results reviewed by appropriate mathematicians
              outside of JMU; (9) Presenting results at professional meetings during the
              following
academic year; and (10) Continued contact with the mentors after the
              end of the project.
