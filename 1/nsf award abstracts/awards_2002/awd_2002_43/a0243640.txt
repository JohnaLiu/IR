Abstract    :
              The University of Alabama-Birmingham (UAB) continues operating a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site. The Site is hosted by the Department
              of Physics at UAB and includes participation of faculty from Samford
              University.  Ten undergraduate students are be recruited every year for a
              ten-week summer research experience, with a student recruitment focus on women
              and underrepresented minorities.  Student research projects include
              high-pressure materials research, diamond thin films growth and
              characterization, microelectronic materials, laser materials, biomaterials and
              computer simulations of electronic structure and CVD processes.  In addition to
              participating in individual research projects, REU students will attend
              seminars on scientific communication and ethics in research, on-campus social
              activities, and some will give presentations at regional and national
              meetings.

The REU Site includes a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET)
              component. The Site recruits two Birmingham area high school teachers every
              year for a 5-week summer research experience.  Teachers participate in
              open-ended research projects in conjunction with REU participants and under the
              direction of the faculty. RET participants also attend the seminars on ethics
              in research and scientific communication. Opportunities for incorporating
              curricular materials in the classroom are addressed in an internal workshop.
