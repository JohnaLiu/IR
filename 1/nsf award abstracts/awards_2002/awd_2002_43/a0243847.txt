Abstract    :
              The University of Arizona continues operating a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site.  The REU Site utilizes electron microscopy, optical
              characterization and other microanalytical tools as common thread in several
              research projects on materials synthesis and processing.  Eight undergraduate
              students are recruited every year for a ten-week summer research experience,
              with a recruitment focus on undergraduates from underrepresented groups.  In
              addition to participating in individual research projects, REU students take a
              one-week course on electron microscopy or optical characterization, attend a
              workshop on ethics in research, and participate in group social activities. The
              REU Site includes a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) component. Eight
              teachers are recruited every year for a six-week summer research
              experience.

The REU Site also has an international component by which two
              returning undergraduates and two returning teachers spend four weeks in one of
              the laboratories at the Thailand National Science and Technology Development
              Agency.  Teachers that go to Thailand spend two more weeks in the RET
              experience than those who stay in the US. Undergraduates and teachers
              participate in one of four collaborative research projects between US and Thai
              senior investigators.
