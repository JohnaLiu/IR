Abstract    :
              Drs. Albert Boggess (PI) and Jay Walton (co-PI) (in Math) together with Drs.
              Dave Larson (Math) and Tom Wehrly (in Statistics) propose to establish an NSF
              REU Site in mathematics and statistics at Texas A&M University in College
              Station. We seek funding for 60 student participants over a three year period
              starting in June, 2003. REU students will join A&M undergraduate and graduate
              students who are participants in our VIGRE program, which runs vertically
              integrated research seminars covering topics of interest here to the faculty.
              During the summer of 2003, we intend to run two simultaneous eight-week
              programs; one in matrix analysis and wavelets, organized by Dave Larson in
              Math, and the other in the mathematics of ecology. The program in ecology will
              have at least two tracks - one involving statistical models, organized by Tom
              Wehrly in Statistics, and the other involving diffusion models, organized by
              Jay Walton in Math. Both Dave Larson and Jay Walton have played key roles in
              our current REU program and both have organized similar seminars during the
              academic year for our VIGRE program. In future summers (2004 and beyond),
              additional REU programs are planned and will likely arise from successful VIGRE
              seminars that run during the academic year. Participants will be paid a stipend
              of $250 per week plus a $25 per day food allowance. They will also stay in
              on-campus dormitories which will be charged directly to the grant.
