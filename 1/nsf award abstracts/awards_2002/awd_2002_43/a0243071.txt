              ABSTRACT

OCE-0243071

Fifteen scientist who participated in the initial
              international intercalibration exercise carried out under the auspices of the
              SCOR Working Group 109 will be invited to participate in a workshop to be held
              on December 5, 2002 in San Francisco.  The objective of the workshop is to
              analyze and interpret dissolved Fe measurements obtained by about 20
              laboratories for a water samples collected in the South Atlantic.  Initial
              evaluation of the data obtained for this sample by the different laboratories
              shows values ranging from 0.3 nM to 2.0 nM.  Given the importance of this
              element as a micronutrient which can limit primary production, it is imperative
              that the reasons for the variability in the results be identified.  Amongst the
              possible problems that could be contributing to the variability in the values
              obtained thus far are the following:  (1) contamination in the laboratory where
              the initial sample was separated into separate aliquots; (2) contamination in
              the participants laboratory; and (3) different recoveries by the various
              methods used to obtain the Fe values.  It is expected that during this workshop
              the factors responsible for the observed variability in Fe concentrations for a
              single sample will be identified, as well as that guidelines for the next
              intercomparison exercise be established.
