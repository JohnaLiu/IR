Abstract    :
              This REU Site award provides funding for 10 students to participate in a 10-week
              REU Site.  The focus of the site is archaeobiology at Sylvester Manor, Shelter
              Island, New York.  The 250 acre site contains extensive and well-preserved
              archaeological remains of a Late Woodland (pre-contact) Native American
              settlement, and a 1652-1735 agricultural plantation established to ship
              provisions to the Caribbean.  The primary goals of the research are to
              understand the patterns of cultural interaction and cultural change among the
              diverse groups on the plantation, and to reconstruct land use and landscape
              change through time.  This research has promise to add an important new
              perspective to our understanding of colonization and cultural transformation in
              Colonial America.  

The first week of this REU Site is spent in laboratory
              training, the next four weeks are spent on archaeological excavation and sample
              collection at Sylvester Manor, and the last five weeks are laboratory work and
              research write-up.  At the end of the 10 weeks, the students will engage in
              public presentation of their research results.

This award contributes to the
              Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in
              science through active undergraduate research experiences.
