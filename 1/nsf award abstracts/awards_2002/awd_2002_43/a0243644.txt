Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for an REU Site in archaeology and cultural
              anthropology at the Lower Cacaulapa Project in NW Honduras. Eight undergraduate
              students will conduct independent field research. Participants will take a
              common core of seminars that introduce them to archaeological and ethnographic
              methods and theory and sensitize them to the political, cultural, and economic
              context in which they will live and work. Student investigations will include
              explorations of modern and ancient cultural processes and behavioral patterns.
              This course of study is founded on the directors' considerable experience in
              collaborating with and teaching undergraduates within field settings in the
              past, most particularly on NSF REU Site projects that they directed in the Naco
              vally, Honduras in 1988, 1990, 1992, 1995, and 1996, and in the lower Cacaulapa
              valley during 2000 and 2002.

This award contributes to the Foundation's
              continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through
              active undergraduate research experiences.
