Abstract    :
              The objectives of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) pilot study
              are: 1) to identify the failure modes and the failure mechanisms of newly
              designed and fabricated high k dielectric nano devices, and 2) to analyze and
              characterize the early failure pattern that can be used in a Bayesian analysis.
               The goal of the study is to use failure mode identification to set the
              foundation for reliability analysis and validation in newly designed nano
              products (being fabricated by the Co-PI). Failure mechanisms and other physical
              properties have a significant bearing on high infant mortality and low yield.
              Because the sample quantity available for reliability testing is small and the
              products are expensive, it is inevitable that Bayesian analysis will have to be
              used. This study intends to determine exactly what information to extract for
              such an analysis. The end result of the work will lead to a full-scale project
              for developing a theoretical model to bridge the reliability and yield
              relationship for nano products.

This multidisciplinary project will
              rigorously explore reliability applications in a newly invented nano product.
              The project will bring to the academic community a theoretical foundation for
              modeling nano reliability. This project will have major impact on society
              because it is the first exploratory study to address the reliability issue at
              the design stage in newly fabricated nano devices.
