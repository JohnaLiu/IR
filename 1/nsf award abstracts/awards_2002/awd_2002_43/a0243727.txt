Abstract    :
              The Psychology Research Experience Program (PREP) provides a systematic and
              thorough exposure to research in psychology with a focus on professional
              development as a researcher in psychology.  PREP students become members of the
              mentor's laboratory, taking part in all aspects of research from reading the
              appropriate literature and discussing research ideas with the mentor, to
              gathering and analyzing data, to organizing and interpreting the results.  PREP
              students interact closely with other undergraduate and graduate students in the
              mentor's lab.  The end of the PREP program is marked by a symposium in the last
              week where each PREP student makes a 15-minute oral presentation of the work
              they did during the summer. 

Additionally, weekly group meetings are held
              with all PREP students.  At these meetings, each mentor presents his or her
              research to the PREP students.  In this way, each PREP student is exposed to a
              broad range of psychological research.  Also, films are shown each week to
              spark student discussion of ethical issues in science.  PREP students are
              housed with other young scientists in similar programs in other scientific
              disciplines.  

This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts
              to attract talented students into careers in science through active
              undergraduate research experiences.
