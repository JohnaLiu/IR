This award funds a three-year Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site at Cleveland State University. NSF will support six
              students per year for research opportunities in glass and electrorheological
              sciences. The program will be implemented at the Industrial Technology
              Institute (ITI) at the university to (1) give undergraduate students
              opportunities to innovate on real technology-development projects; (2) attract
              and retain highly-motivated undergraduate students into engineering careers
              while emphasizing the participation of populations underrepresented in research
              fields in the United States; (3) offer students an early opportunity to
              experience applied engineering research and development in high-performance
              glass forming technology and electrorheological fluids; and (4) balance the
              academic classroom learning experience with hands-on experience. The program is
              designed as a yearlong activity where students work 20 hours per week during
              the school year and 40 hours per week during the summer.
