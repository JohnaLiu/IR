This award funds a three-year Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Alabama Huntsville (UAH) that
              will provide students with a research experience in the area of advanced
              composite materials and systems. Student participants, ten each year, will be
              engaged in educational and research activities over a period of ten weeks
              during the summer. Each student will be assigned to a clearly defined project
              that is related to current research efforts at the university. The students
              will not only participate in scientific research but will also learn how to
              integrate their work into larger projects. Students will be recruited from the
              following groups: UAH programs, minority-serving institutions, and four-year
              schools that do not have large research programs. This REU Site is supported by
              the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU Program.
