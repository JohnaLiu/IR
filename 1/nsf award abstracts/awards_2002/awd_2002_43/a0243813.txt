	Mean field models for spin glasses (such as the famous
              Sherrington Kirkpatrick model) exhibit some completely new phenomenon of
              probability theory, that at a high level can be described as the existence of
              intricate structures among the near extreme values of large families of
              correlated random variables. The rigorous study of these models is still in its
              infancy, and the main goal of this proposal is to pursue it. Two of the
              specific goals are to obtain a better understanding of the low-temperature
              phase of the p-spin interaction model, and to start the study of the new
              Hamiltonians introduced by F. Guerra in his broken replica-symmetry bound for
              the Sherrington Kirkpatrick model. 
	One of the central themes of probability
              theory is the emergence of a kind of order out of large number of random
              events. This is expressed by classical theorems, such as the law of large
              numbers. These classical results relate to situations where the random events
              are independent, that is, the outcome of one does not influence the outcome of
              the others. Such an assumption is unrealistic in practice. We investigate the
              emergence of new types of collective behavior in large collections of random
              events, where each event can, and will, influence the outcome of the others.
              The specific mathematical models have been motivated by the behavior of
              magnetized particles, and are known as "spin glasses".
