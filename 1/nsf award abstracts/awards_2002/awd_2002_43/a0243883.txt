The award supports
              a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of
              Alabama Tuscaloosa for the summers of 2003-2005.  Lowell D. Kispert is the site
              director; John Vincent is the co-PI.  Twelve students (eleven supported by NSF)
              will carry out research with faculty and research groups in the chemistry
              department each summer over a ten-week period.  The site will encourage
              applications from minority and handicapped students. Four high school teachers
              will also participate in research at this site under the program, Research
              Experience for Teachers (RET). All participants will carry out research under
              the supervision of faculty in the chemistry department. They will select a
              well-defined interdisciplinary program in environmental, materials, or
              biological chemistry.  Training acquired during development of these projects
              will be enhanced by weekly noontime seminars and problem sessions.  The REU
              students will present a seminar in the last week.  Each will submit a final
              report on his/her accomplishments and construct a poster to be displayed at a
              regional ACS meeting and at their school.
