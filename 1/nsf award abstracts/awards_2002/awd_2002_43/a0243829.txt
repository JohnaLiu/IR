The Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site at Texas A&M University for the summers of 2003-2006.
               Gary A. Sulikowski is the site's program director.  Twelve faculty members
              from the chemistry department will serve as REU mentors to ten students, who
              will each participate in a ten-week program.  Students from non-Ph. D.
              institutions will be targeted for participation in the program.  Research
              projects will feature biological chemistry, environmental chemistry and
              materials chemistry. The program will have weekly meetings and a career
              development day to provide information on career opportunities in modern
              chemical sciences.
