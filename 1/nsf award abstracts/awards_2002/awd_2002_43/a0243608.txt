This award funds a three-year Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site at Western Michigan University to provide a summer
              research experience in computer-aided testing and simulation of mechanical
              components and systems for ten undergraduate students each year. This program
              will take a multidisciplinary approach utilizing experimental and numerical
              techniques to provide a research experience that encourages students to
              consider graduate studies and pursue careers in engineering research. Students
              will be recruited from colleges in the Great Lakes region and also nationwide,
              with a special focus on students that do not have access to research
              opportunities at their home institution and students from underrepresented
              groups. Activities will include a short course on computer-aided testing and
              simulation; an ethics workshop; an evaluation program; and other related
              professional and social activities that will allow a fuller appreciation of
              research opportunities and careers in academia. This REU Site is supported by
              the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU Program.
