              ABSTRACT:  EIA 0243337, ACM, Barbara Ryder, PI		

This award to the
              Association Computing Machinery (ACM) ) provides funds for  "Travel Grants for
              Faculty at Minority/Female Institutions to attend FCRC'03".  The project
              supports faculty actively involved with the education of women and minorities
              to attend the constituent conferences of FCRC 2003, the primary technical
              conference incorporating the interests of many of the ACM special interest
              groups.  The project incorporates a special panel and discussion session for
              the travel grant recipients on the issue of recruiting and retaining women and
              minorities in computer-related fields.  Targeted schools include primarily
              undergraduate institutions, including HBCUs, women's colleges, and other
              colleges with large minority enrollments.  An additional set of faculty is
              being similarly supported by the ACM SIG Project Fund as part of the overall
              effort.
