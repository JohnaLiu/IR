The Chemistry
              Department at the State University of New York - Environmental Science and
              Forestry (SUNY-ESF) will be the site for a Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) program during the summers of 2003-2005.  The site will
              operate together with the neighboring institution Le Moyne College.  Theodore 
              S. Dibble (SUNY-ESF) is the site director and John Smarrelli (Le Moyne) is
              co-PI..   The site will host 13 students (10 NSF supported) for ten weeks. 
              SUNY-ESF has maintained a focus on applied chemistry while emphasizing the
              fundamental aspects of chemistry as a central science.  The research projects
              available to the REU students reflect this emphasis on "Chemistry with a
              Purpose".  Interdisciplinary chemistry projects include topics from physical,
              atmospheric, biochemistry, polymers, synthetic organic, environmental, biobased
              materials, biotechnology and green chemistry.  Students will meet each week to
              discuss topics related to career and professional development issues.  Ethics
              education will be under the direction of Dr. Lynne Arnault from Le Moyne
              College.  A poster session will be held at the end of the summer.
