This award supports a three-year Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site that will be a part of the National Nanofabrication
              Users Network (NNUN) established by NSF in 1994. The REU Site will provide a
              ten week summer research experience at each of the member institutions for 12
              student participants per year at Cornell University; 10 student participants
              per year at the University of California Santa Barbara; 8 student participants
              per year at Penn State University; 6 student participants per year at Howard
              University; and 12 student participants per year at Stanford University.
              Students are recruited from colleges and universities throughout the United
              States with a focus on sophomore-level and junior-level students and with an
              effort to attract students from smaller non-research universities and students
              from underrepresented groups.  The program provides students with an
              opportunity to do research in the fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology.
              Students will work on independent research projects using the advanced
              fabrication resources available through the NNUN with opportunities for
              research collaboration with faculty and students at each of the five-member
              NNUN institutions. This REU Site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in
              partnership with the NSF REU Program.
