This award
              will provide travel grant awards to U.S. speakers, authors of
papers, and
              young academic participants to the Conference on Water Purification and Reuse,
              to be held in Potsdam, Germany, on June 9-13, 2003.  The purpose of the
              Conference is to discuss the latest advancements of the important technologies
              for purifying industrial and municipal wastewater for reuse and the latest
              developments of process design and integration methods for water treatment. The
              researchers in the water purification field have diverse background, mainly in
              chemical engineering, chemistry, civil engineering, and environmental
              engineering. It is important to provide a needed forum through this conference
              to bring researchers with different backgrounds and from different countries
              together for disseminating and exchanging the latest scientific information. It
              will provide an opportunity for developing international collaboration for
              solving the global problem of water purification and reuse. Moreover, plans are
              being made to publish a proceeding in the form of a book for dissemination of
              the state-of-the-art information on water purification and reuse.  The proposed
              budget will provide for 15-20 partial travel grant awards to U.S. speakers,
              authors of papers, and young academic participants at the Conference.
