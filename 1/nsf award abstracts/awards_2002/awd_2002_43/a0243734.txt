Abstract    :
              Clemson supports a multidisciplinary Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              (REU) Site with an emphasis on the applications of nanotechnology in health and
              food sciences. Twelve students are recruited nationwide every year for a
              ten-week summer research experience.  Students participate in a variety of
              research projects within the physical and biological sciences and engineering,
              with a focus on the design and development of nanostructures for biosensing
              applications. In addition, students participate in weekly seminars and in a
              local research symposium at the end of the summer.
