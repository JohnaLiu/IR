Abstract    :
              In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Ault will investigate the oxidation/reduction reactions in
              transition metal compounds. Specifically, these include metal oxo compounds,
              using chromyl chloride, CrCl2O2, vanadium oxytrichloride, OVCl3, and
              methyltrioxorhenium, CH3ReO3, as prototype systems.  Another class of systems
              to be studied is the organic peroxides of which hydrogen peroxide is the
              prototype.  The goals of this work are: 1)Identification of the key
              intermediates in the reaction pathway; 2) Sspectroscopic and structural
              characterizations of the intermediates; 3) Ccomparison of the experimental
              results with those obtained from high level ab initio calculations; and 4) 
              Mechanistic studies of these reactions.

While of intrinsic interest to
              chemistry, the results of this work will have wide applications ranging from
              organic synthesis to CVD thin film formation.  The PI has an excellent record
              of involving graduate and undergraduate students in his research.  They receive
              valuable training in preparation for advanced studies and entry into the
              scientific/technological workforce.
