Abstract    :
              The Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) is a collaboration of
Duke
              University, North Carolina State University, the University of North
Carolina
              at Chapel Hill, and other institutions in the North Carolina
Triangle area,
              which has established a diverse research program in low-energy
              nuclear
physics. TUNL has a strong reputation for providing hands-on
              experimental
research experience to graduate and undergraduate students, who
              are involved
in all aspects of nuclear physics experiments. Research projects
              are focused
on resolving issues in, for example, few-body physics,
              nuclear-level
densities, weak interactions and fundamental symmetries,
              photonuclear
reactions, nuclear astrophysics and radiative-capture
              reactions.

The REU summer program provides undergraduate students with a
              realistic and
active research experience through the completion of a
              self-contained
10-week project and through the understanding of the project's
              integral
contribution to the ongoing research program at TUNL. The broad scope
              of
activities at TUNL, which involve data collection, data analysis
              and
instrumentation development, offers the variety in project selection
              needed
to productively involve students who have diverse academic and
              research
backgrounds, capabilities and interests. To broaden the research
              experience,
a special lecture series has been incorporated into the program to
              increase
the students' exposure to current topics in nuclear physics and to
              share
details about the research resources at TUNL. At the end of the
              summer
program, students prepare written and oral presentations that help them
              to
organize an overview of their research projects.
