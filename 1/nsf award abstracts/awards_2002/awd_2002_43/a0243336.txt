Abstract    :
              This work focuses on quantitative studies of fluctuations caused by thermal
              noise below and near bifurcations in systems far from equilibrium.  Well below
              the bifurcation it is expected that the measurements will test recent
              predictions about the structure factor of a fluid in a thermal gradient. Near
              the bifurcation the nonlinear interactions between the fluctuations should lead
              to critical phenomena in the sense that the various measurable quantities will
              deviate non-trivially from mean-field (or linear) predictions. The experiments
              will focus on Rayleigh-Bernard convection (RBC) in a horizontal layer of a
              fluid heated from below, and on electro convection (EC) of a nematic liquid
              crystal in an electric field. It has been predicted that RBC belongs to a
              universality class first studied theoretically by Brazovskii for which
              fluctuations change the bifurcation from a second-order to a first-order
              transition.  For electro convection there is at present no theory of the
              critical behavior, but on general grounds one expects several different
              universality classes that depend on the relationship between the nematic
              director and the convection-roll wave director.  The experiments will open a
              new research field of critical phenomena in non-equilibrium systems, and will
              prepare graduate students and postgraduate researchers for academic or
              industrial careers. Within an outreach program they will offer opportunities
              for participation by high school students.

Many properties of equilibrium
              systems exhibit large thermally driven fluctuations near critical points.  An
              example is the density of a fluid near a liquid-gas critical point.  Nonlinear
              interactions between the fluctuations then cause the critical behavior to be
              different from that which is expected when fluctuations are small.  The same
              phenomena should occur in a very different context, namely near transitions in
              non-equilibrium systems.  For example, the transition from pure conduction to
              convection in a thin horizontal layer of a fluid heated from below was
              predicted to be of second order when fluctuations were neglected, but to become
              a first-order transition when they were considered.  This work will determine
              the critical behavior near transitions in several non-equilibrium systems,
              including convection in a fluid heated from below and convection in a liquid
              crystal exposed to an electric voltage.  This research will use advanced
              experimental techniques and sophisticated numerical image analysis, which will
              provide excellent training of graduate students for careers in academic and
              industrial positions. It also lends itself well to the participation of
              undergraduate students.  Within an outreach program it is expected that high
              school students will also participate in some of the experiments.
