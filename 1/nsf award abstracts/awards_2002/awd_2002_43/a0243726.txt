This award supports the Department of Chemical Engineering
              at the University of South Carolina (USC) for the establishment of a three-year
              Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Japan. Students will be
              assigned an individual research project to work in the Fall Semester with
              faculty research mentors at Osaka University, Sophia University (Tokyo), and
              Kyoto University in collaboration with USC faculty. In addition, two USC U.S.
              graduate (Ph.D.) students will also travel to Japan together with the REU group
              and serve as mentors to the students while also doing research in Japan.
              Research projects will be on topics such as the catalytic role of supercritical
              water in organic reactions; molecular simulations of gas permeation through
              organic membranes; shock tube studies of the thermal decomposition of
              hydrocarbons; the synthesis of molecular composites; emission control during
              the pyrolosis of coal; and synthesis of nanoporous materials using copolymer
              gel templates. In addition to the individual research projects, the REU program
              will include group activities to enrich the participants' education and
              research experience and facilitate collaboration and long-term relationships
              with Japanese collaborators. Group activities will involve technical, social,
              and cultural events such as tours of industrial research facilities and
              participation in local community festivals. Students will be recruited from
              chemical engineering programs throughout the United States. USC will also focus
              on recruiting students from underrepresented groups at institutions such as
              North Carolina A&T State University; Florida A&M University-Florida State
              University College of Engineering; and the University of Puerto Rico. This REU
              Site is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering
              and the NSF Directorate for Engineering.
