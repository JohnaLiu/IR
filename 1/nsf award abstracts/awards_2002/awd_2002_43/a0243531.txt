The Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site at Occidental College for the summers of 2003-2005. 
              Phoebe K. Dea is the site's program director.  Six faculty members from the
              chemistry department will serve as REU mentors to eight students, who will each
              participate in a ten-week program.  Half of the students will be recruited from
              local community colleges.  The proposed research projects range from
              biophysical chemistry, to organic synthesis, to biochemistry,  to advanced
              materials research.  The program will have weekly research seminars, student
              presentations, several social events and a final week College-wide poster
              session and oral presentations.
