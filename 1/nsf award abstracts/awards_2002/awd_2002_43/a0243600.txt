Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for an REU site at the University of Hawaii (UH) Sea
              Grant College. This REU site is supported by the Department of Defense in
              partnership with the National Science Foundation's REU program. The funding
              supports a stipend, housing, travel, partial board and laboratory expenses for
              eight to ten students per year for three years, beginning in the summer of
              2003, during an intensive 10-week summer research program. The students will
              work one-one-one with UH Manoa faculty mentors to develop and implement
              individual research projects, collect and analyze data, interpret results, and
              present their findings in oral seminars and written reports. They will be
              expected to write bi-weekly reports, submit a final report and give at least
              two oral presentations during the session. Students will be recruited from
              across the nation.
