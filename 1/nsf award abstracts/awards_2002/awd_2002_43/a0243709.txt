Abstract    :
              The REU program in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Michigan State
              University offers to undergraduate students the opportunity to do forefront
              research in a field of physics -- nuclear, condensed matter, high-energy, or
              astrophysics. Approximately twenty students participate in the program each
              summer. They live and work on the MSU campus for a 10-week period. Seminars,
              field trips, social activities, and sports are planned, in addition to the
              individual research projects.

Each student in the program will work on a
              well-defined research project under the direction of a faculty mentor. A wide
              variety of projects is available, both experimental and theoretical. In nuclear
              physics, MSU is the site of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory;
              research
opportunities include experimental nuclear physics, accelerator and
              detector design and testing, and theoretical studies. Condensed matter physics
              includes basic solid-state physics and properties of new materials. REU
              projects in high-energy physics are done at MSU, relating to experiments at
              Fermilab and CERN. In the field of astrophysics, a 24-inch reflecting telescope
              is available at MSU, and data from other observatories may be analyzed. At the
              end of the program
each student will write a research report and give an oral
              presentation.
