This award will supply shipboard
              scientific support equipment for the research vessel Ewing operated by the
              Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University and dedicated to use in
              support of marine research.  The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program
              provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe
              conduct of ocean science research. The Program provides support for such items
              as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of
              scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and
              earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research sites,
              communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers
              for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as
              motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval
              sites.  The Project Director, Paul Ljunggren is fully qualified to direct this
              project having had considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and
              installation of shipboard equipment.  This project will allow the institution
              to acquire a Tasman P-Code GPS Receiver, seismic air compressor oil coolers and
              valves, a fire detection system, and refurbishment of an inflatable workboat.
