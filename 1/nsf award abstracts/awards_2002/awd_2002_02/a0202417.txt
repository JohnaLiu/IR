Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive teacher preparation
              program at Amarillo College, with emphasis in mathematics and science, and
              formal articulation with schools of education at Texas universities. The
              objectives of the project are to: 1) develop the mathematics courses, refine
              the science curriculum, and update the general education curriculum for
              elementary education; 2) enhance the Amarillo College Teacher Education project
              through new Introductory Education courses, and by emphasizing hand on,
              collaborative learning pedagogy and the use of technology in the classroom; 3)
              develop and implement partnerships and articulation agreements with Texas
              Universities Schools of Education, beginning with West Texas A&M and Texas Tech
              Universities; and 4) increase the number of teachers well-prepared to teach the
              students of the Texas Panhandle at all pre-college levels, K-12. The objectives
              are being implemented through the newly formed Teacher Education Department in
              the Division of Sciences and Engineering. New mathematics and science courses
              incorporate real-world experiences and labs, and the use of technology in
              teaching and in science. Technology as a teaching tool is taught through the
              use of technology including Smart classrooms, interactive TV classrooms,
              computer lab assignments, and Internet ancillaries. Recruitment efforts are
              designed to attract women, minorities and those who are considering a career
              change. Industry partners enrich the teacher preparation program by involving
              scientists and technicians with instructional course development and onsite
              labs, hosting field trips, and offering internships. Collaborations with school
              districts provide mentor teachers for preservice students, field observations
              of K-8 classrooms, and tutoring opportunities.
