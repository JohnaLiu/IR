Abstract    :
              This project will use an analytical approach to describe the evolution of ring
              current ions and electrons during magnetic storms.  A more realistic magnetic
              field and electric field will be used than has previously been done in analytic
              studies.  It will examine the radial transport and loss mechanisms of particles
              in the inner magnetosphere and will examine the role the ring current and its
              associated magnetic field play on the particle dynamics.  The motion of both
              electrons and ions will be described using a Hamiltonian formalism.  This
              formalism will allow the model to treat the particle motions even near the
              inner boundary of the ring current region (L ~ 2).
