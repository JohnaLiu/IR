Abstract    :
              This proposal studies changes in opinion and judgment that follow as
              consequences of the ongoing "War on Terrorism," declared in response to the
              terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  It is anticipated that military and
              diplomatic success and failure and renewed terrorist events will influence
              opinions regarding security versus liberty.  The research will be done in the
              lab, by national telephone polling, and via the Internet using several of the
              new WWW methods for conducting research.

The primary goal of the research is
              to study models of how biasing phrases affect judged agreement with questions
              posed in polls.  It has long been known that the results of polls depend
              strongly on how questions are  worded.  This research will attempt to separate
              the effects of bias from those of more stable "true" psychological values.

A
              secondary goal is to compare results obtained with inexpensive, efficient, new
              Internet methods to those obtained from more standard polling.  This project
              will also attempt to determine which of several Internet methods of sampling is
              most accurate in matching the results of more standard polling.
