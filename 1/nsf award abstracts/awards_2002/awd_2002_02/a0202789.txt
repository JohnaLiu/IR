              Experimental Computer Science: Postdoctoral Research in Distributed
              Robotics

This proposed research is intended to create more versatile robots
              by using self-configuration: the autonomous organization and reorganization of
              large numbers of modular robots into geometric structures.  Structures of such
              robots would be well-suited to a variety of situations where environmental
              models (e.g., terrain, hazards) and task specifications (e.g., sensing,
              manipulation) are uncertain.  To create autonomous robotic systems of this
              nature, the fundamental goal of this research is to develop a science-base for
              modular self-reconfiguring systems.  The postdoctoral research associate will
              explore new ideas on distributed planning and control and focus on general
              rather than architecture-specific algorithms.  The plan is to use existing
              designs and robot systems to demonstrate the applicability of such algorithms
              to locomotion and simple manipulation tasks.
