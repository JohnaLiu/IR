Abstract    :
              This project will examine the physical processes that accelerate electrons and
              ions in the discrete auroras.  These processes are of fundamental importance to
              the electrodynamics coupling between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere.  The
              project will use a combination of theoretical tools such as 1 and 2 dimensional
              Vlasov codes, 1 and 2 dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) codes and analytical
              modeling.  Results from the theoretical investigation will be combined with
              observations from the FAST satellite to determine how relevant different
              physical processes may be to the particle acceleration.  In addition to the
              direct results of the study, the improved simulation codes are likely to be
              applicable to a broad range of other problems.
