Abstract    :
              A major part of understanding the proteome, the entire array of proteins
              produced by a cell or organism, is understanding how proteins interact with
              each other and the structure of that interaction.  Much of the information
              about this is in literature and not easy to search or follow.  A categorization
              of known information about protein interactions will be compiled and put into a
              web-accessible, user-friendly database.  The database structure will reflect
              the biology of the proteins involved.  The series of students are involved in
              producing the raw data and in formatting the database.  The data, accessible to
              the general public, will be of particular use to researchers investigating
              protein interactions and structures.
