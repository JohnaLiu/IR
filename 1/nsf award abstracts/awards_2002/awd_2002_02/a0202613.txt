Abstract    :
              Orbifold subfactors have been first described by Y. Kawahigashi as an
              application of paragroup theory.  It is known that subfactors of type D_4n and
              D_4n+2 give rise to fusion algebras of bimodules with different natures,  but
              the origin of the difference is unknown.  Asaeda has been working on this
              problem, and obtained the clue to clarify the fusion structure of orbifold
              subfactors. On this research, the relation between the representation theory of
              classical Lie group and that of quantum group (WZW model) plays a crucial role.
              Her research includes further research on this matter, and clarification of the
              relation between orbifold of WZW model, structure of the representation of the
              classical Lie groups, and the nature of subfactors arising from WZW model. On
              the other hand, her research extends to the study of subfactors which are not
              arising from quantum groups or classical groups. These subfactors are called
              exotic subfactors. Her focus is on the structure of quantum double constructed
              from exotic subfactors. 
The theory of operator algebras was founded by von
              Neumann as a mathematical background of quantum mechanics. Lately the relation
              among operator algebras, quantum physics, and low dimensional topology has been
              sought from the aspect that is totally different from that of von Neumann. The
              research on this subject and it's relation with other subjects will contribute
              the development of many subjects in mathematics and mathematical physics.
