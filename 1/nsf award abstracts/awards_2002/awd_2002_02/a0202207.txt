Abstract    :
              In research supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program, Professor
              Lindner and his coworkers at the University of Memphis are developing
              ion-selective electrodes with sub-micromolar detection limits. The best results
              are expected when the parasitic, transmembrane ion fluxes, across the
              ion-selective membrane, are prevented through the application of a few nA/cm2
              direct current. Chrono-amperometric and chrono-potentiometric measurements will
              be employed in combination with spectroscopic imaging of transport processes in
              the sensing membrane to develop measurement protocols for the analysis of
              extremely dilute samples. The methods will be adapted to small size,
              microfabricated sensors and tested in environmental and biological
              samples.

Ion-selective electrodes are simple, accurate and cost effective
              devices for both in vivo and in vitro measurement of ion concentrations. Dr.
              Lindner and his coworkers in the Joint Graduate Program for Biomedical
              Engineering at the University of Memphis are working on experimental techniques
              that project several orders of magnitudes improvement in the performance of ion
              sensors. This improvement is expected to profoundly affect the role of
              ion-selective electrodes in microanalysis, e.g., in environmental monitoring,
              or cellular biology.
