The
              project  is about international collaboration with researchers in Korea,
              focusing on the structure and opto-electronic properties of inorganic
              nanostructure/dye molecule hybrid systems.  This research will use nuclear
              magnetic resonance (NMR) to study gas adsorption in single walled carbon
              nanotubes (SWNTs) and the structure of SWNT/dye system. These
              nanostructure-based hybrid systems could play an important role in future
              technological developments such as molecular sensors and solar cells. The
              collaboration will help to advance research on the opto-electronic properties
              of nanostructure/dye hybrid systems.
