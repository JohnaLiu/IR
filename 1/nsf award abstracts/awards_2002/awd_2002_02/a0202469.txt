Abstract    :
              	This dissertation research will investigate how adolescents from non-intact
              families are affected by the involvement of the nonresident parent in their
              lives.  The results will extend past work on the importance of financial
              involvement to a consideration of parental practices such as talking, arguing,
              and engaging in joint activities.  Outcomes to be studied include academic
              achievement, school attendance, grades, emotional well-being, and behavioral
              problems.  Secondary analyses of existing national surveys will be complemented
              by in-depth interviews with 50 adolescents and 30 parents from the local
              area.
