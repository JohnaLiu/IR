Abstract    :
              This award is concerned about developing a new technology to study potentially
              damaging characteristics of near-field seismic ground motions and their impacts
              to building structures.  By using a moving reference coordinate system, the
              motion (acceleration, velocity and displacement) trajectories can be decomposed
              into kinetically separated parameters that represent different effects of the
              combined dynamic forces.  This approach is useful to probe the various types of
              structural damages caused by a near-field ground motion with prominent velocity
              or acceleration pulses-a phenomenon that has been observed as the cause of
              various types of near-field structural damages.  The research will consist of
              three major tasks: (1). Analyze and extract damage parameters from recent major
              earthquake ground motions; (2). Develop a new sensing system to measure the
              damage parameters; (3). Integrate the identified key damage parameters into
              structural demand and capacity models for potential earthquake engineering
              application
