Abstract    :
              With funding from NSF since 1998, Athens Technical College (ATC) has developed
              and alpha tested a six-module, contextually driven, laboratory-based curriculum
              in chemical technology, known as C3T. The curriculum module development has
              been carried out in two phases. In the first phase, the project team developed
              and alpha tested three modules which address Aqueous Systems, Polymer Systems,
              and Metal Systems. During the second phase three additional modules on Drug
              Delivery Systems, Petroleum Energy Systems, and Remote Monitoring Systems were
              developed. Each laboratory module has a flexible design to facilitate
              integration into the first or second year of any two-year chemical technology
              program. All six modules have been field tested at ATC and Los Angeles
              Trade-Technical College.

The current project constitutes the final phase of
              work to complete the contextually-based, laboratory-driven curriculum.
              Specifically, this project is (1) field testing all six modules at 12 two-year
              technical colleges, (2) conducting two summer faculty training workshops for
              two-year college faculty to prepare for use of the curriculum materials at
              their sites, and (3) preparing and disseminating the modules, including student
              and instructors manuals in electronic and printed form for two-year chemical
              technology faculty as well as undergraduate chemistry faculty.
