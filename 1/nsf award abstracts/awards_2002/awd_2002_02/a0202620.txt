The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will support a twenty-four month research
              fellowship by Dr. Wesley A. Henderson to work with Dr. Stefano Passerini at the
              Italian Agency for New Technologies, Energy and the Environment (ENEA) in Rome,
              Italy.

This project is based on the study and development of alternative
              electrolytes (molten salts and ionic plastic crystalline materials) for
              lithium/air batteries.  The development of such materials could provide
              critical breakthroughs in battery technology for a wide array of applications
              (e.g., electrically powered automobiles, power generation equipment, and
              electronics.).  The lithium/air batteries potentially have an order of
              magnitude higher specific energy than zinc/air batteries, which are used
              currently, but these suffer from problems such as corrosion of lithium metal
              with water.  These problems have inhibited their commercial use with
              conventional, highly hydrophobic electrolytes such as poly(ethylene
              oxide)/lithium salts.  The hybrophobic molten salts to be studied in this
              project represent a potential solution to this problem.

ENEA's Advanced
              Electrochemical Energy Division conducts projects on both lithium rechargeable
              batteries and polymer electrolyte fuel cells for electric vehicles.
