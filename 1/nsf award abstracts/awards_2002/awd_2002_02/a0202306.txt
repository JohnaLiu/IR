Abstract    :
              This project will develop a generalized model for the equilibrium conditions for
              the Earth's magnetic tail during conditions when the magnetosphere is
              characterized by (1) quasi-steady convection, (2) the growth phase of magnetic
              substorms, and (3) directly driven solar wind effects.  It will use analytic
              methods in conjunction with a computer simulation code that will ensure
              appropriate topological conditions and conservation of flux and/or entropy. 
              The result will be an equilibrium model that can be embedded in a Geospace
              General Circulation Model, or other global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
              simulations of the magnetospheric system.
