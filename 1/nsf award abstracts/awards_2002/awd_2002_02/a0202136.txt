Abstract    :
              Professor Allen Bard of the University of Texas Austin is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study photoelectrochemical and
              optoelectronic effects in solid thin films and nanoparticle dispersions.  The
              materials include traditional semiconductors like silicon and CdSe (quantum
              dots), as well as molecular films of substituted porphyrins, conjugated
              organics and inorganic salts.  Low melting liquid crystals will be
              investigated, as well as inorganic molecular crystals like tris
              (2,2'-bipyridine)ruthenium(II).  Methods include electrochemistry and
              electrogenerated chemiluminescence as well as scanning probe microscopy. 
              

Charge transfer and electrical characteristics of novel material films are
              not well understood, and fundamental studies could lead to better high density
              memories, light emitting diodes and other electronic devices.  Nontraditional
              semiconductor materials will be explored, with potential use in solar energy
              conversion and charge storage devices, for example.
