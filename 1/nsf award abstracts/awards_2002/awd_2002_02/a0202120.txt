This award supports Hung Tseng and a student from University of
              Pennsylvania in a collaboration with Ingrid Grummt of the Section for Molecular
              Cell Biology at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, Germany.  The
              project will focus on the biochemical function of basonuclin, a zinc-finger
              protein and a cell-type specific transcription regulator for the rRNA genes. 
              The US-German collaboration will use biochemical purification, immunological
              detection, and in vitro and in vivo transcription assays to investigate the
              role of basonuclin in polymerase transcription.  All cell require rRNA
              transcription, but its enhancement is particularly necessary when the rate of
              protein synthesis increases in proliferation and protein accumulation.  One of
              the novel aspects of the action of basonuclin is the it is cell-type specific,
              which makes it different from all previously described polymerase I
              transcription factors.  The US side brings current knowledge about basonuclin
              and reagents to the collaboration.  The laboratory of Dr. Grummt is one of the
              leading groups in the world in RNA polymerase I research.  That lab will
              provide expertise and state-of-the-art equipment in biochemical purification
              and analysis of the polymerase transcription complex.  This collaboration will
              help institutionalize the collaborative relationship between the German and US
              research groups.
