The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will support an eight month research
              fellowship by Dr. Alexander L. Dvorsky to work with Dr. Daniel Sternheimer at
              the University de Bourgogne in Dijon, France. Co-funding for this project comes
              from the Math and Physical Science Directorate's Office of Multidisciplinary
              Activities.


Quantization is the process of forming a quantum-mechanical
              system starting from a classical one.  There exist different methods of
              quantization, and Dr. Dvorsky is interested in deformation quantization. 
              Intuitively a deformation of a mathematical object is a family of the same kind
              of objects depending on some parameter.  An example is deforming a cummutative
              algebra of functions (with the ordinary product) leads to the non-commutative
              "star-products" suitable for quantum mechanics.  This project addresses the
              applications of deformation quantization to the central questions of analysis
              on Lie groups (mathematical objects which encode the symmetries of various
              classical-and quantum-mechanical constructions) and Lie supergroups.

The
              host and his laboratory at the Universite de Bourgogne have strong connections
              with leading research performed in France and other countries of the European
              Union.
