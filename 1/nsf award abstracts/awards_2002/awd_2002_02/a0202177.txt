Abstract    :
              0202177   Cannon   The objective of this research is to develop granular
              activated carbons tailored for the removal of organic taste and odor compounds
              from water.  In particular, methyl isoborneol (MIB) and geosmin impart musty
              tastes and odors to drinking water even when they occur at concentrations as
              low as 5-10 parts per trillion;  although these compounds pose no health risks,
              their presence invariably causes complaints and safety concerns among
              consumers.  Activated carbon adsorption offers an important approach for
              removing geosmin, MIB and other odorants.   The research will be conducted in
              three sequential tasks: (1) fundamentals-oriented bench scale testing,
              including methane-steam thermal treatments of the carbon with characterization
              of diffusion rates versus reaction rates during thermal treatment, (2)
              coordination with pilot-scale manufacture of the tailored GAC and (3) pilot
              scale evaluation at a municipal water treatment facility.  The research will
              test the hypothesis that, using a methane-steam heat treatment process,
              increased odorant removal corresponds to increased pore volume, decreased
              surface acidity and increased graphene plane elongation. If successful, this
              project will result in activated carbons tailored to the effective removal of
              MIB, geosmin and other organic compounds.  This project is supported under the
              GOALI program of NSF; the PIs will work closely with NORIT Americas, Inc. in
              the developmental work and with the Passaic Valley Water Commission (NJ) in the
              pilot-scale evaluations.
