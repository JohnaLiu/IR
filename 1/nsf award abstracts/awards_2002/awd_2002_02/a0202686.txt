The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will support a twelve-month research
              fellowship by Dr. Arturo Hernandez to work with Dr. Angela Friederici at the
              Max Planck Institute for Cognitive Neuropsychology in Leipzig, Germany.

This
              project will involve the exploration of the neural correlates of grammatical
              gender processing in German.  The PI will explore the nature of gender
              processing in a three-gender system and studies which compare gender decision
              to error detection.  These studies are expected to further extend our knowledge
              about the neural correlates of grammatical processing.  This work will involve
              a new line of research on the neural correlates of second language
              processing.

The Max Planck Institute will provide access to a
              state-of-the-art Magnetic Resonance Imaging System especially designed for
              psychological experimentation.
