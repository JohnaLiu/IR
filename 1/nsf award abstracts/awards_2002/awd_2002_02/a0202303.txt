Abstract    :
              The Earth's magnetosphere exhibits a variety of behaviors that appear to
              represent distinct states of the magnetosphere.  An alternative theory,
              however, is that these apparently disparate states are simply manifestations of
              a unified response of the magnetosphere to the solar wind driver.  This work
              will clarify the situation by examining the relationship between magnetic
              substorms and magnetic storms and the relationship between magnetic substorms
              and steady magnetospheric convection (SMC).  This project will examine these
              relationships primarily from a data analysis point of view, using data from
              global auroral imagers (Viking, Polar, and IMAGE satellites), neutral atom
              imagery (Polar and IMAGE), energetic particle measurements from the Los Alamos
              geosynchronous satellites and grand-based auroral and magnetic data.
