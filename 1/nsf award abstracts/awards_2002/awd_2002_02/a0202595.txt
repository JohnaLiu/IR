Abstract    :
              This workshop seeks to bring together experts in the area of parallel
              manipulators from around the globe for two days in order to disseminate recent
              research progress and to identify the most promising future research directions
              for parallel manipulators.  This meeting is not a routine conference, wherein
              the primary responsibility of the participant is to present his or her paper. 
              Instead, through a series of focused keynote presentations, round-tables,
              focused paper and poster sessions and in-depth discussion sessions the
              participants will seek convergence on key issues related to parallel
              manipulators.

The objectives of the workshop include: (1) Identify
              roadblocks that must be resolved to increase the industrial use of parallel
              manipulators; (2) Identify promising approaches that may yield significant
              advances in the theoretical framework; (3) Discuss educational needs and
              methods; (4) Develop a strategy for the research community as a whole to
              accelerate the development and use of parallel manipulators; (5) Establish and
              reinforce international collaboration and collaboration between academia and
              industry.  The workshop will be held in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada, on Oct
              3-4, 2002, immediately following the ASME DETC conferences in Montreal (Sept
              29-Oct 2, 2002).
