Partial travel support for the
              speakers at the U.S. - Germany Joint Meeting on Nanoscale Science and
              Engineering to be held at Massachusetts Institute of Technology on December 5
              and 6, 2001.  The objectives are to evaluate new trends in research and
              education and exchange information among leading research centers in both
              countries, to promote the exchange of researchers and establishment of joint
              projects, to introduce younger investigators to nanotechnology, and create
              opportunities for long-term collaboration.  The main list of topics includes
              self-organization, molecular electronics, nanotubes and applications,
              nanoparticles, nanomechanics, catalysts, polymers and pharmaceutics. 
              Representatives of the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers (NSEC) from
              U.S. and Centers of Excellence in Nanotechnology from Germany, as well as
              leading experts and young reserachers from both countries will participate. 
              The meeting is co-organized by MIT (U.S.) and the University of Munster
              (Germany).  About 60 participants, half from U. S. and half from Germany will
              have the opportunity to participate in presentations and discussions during the
              two-day meeting.  A website will be created to post the program and contributed
              papers.  Visits at the MIT and Harvard nanotechnology laboratories will be
              organized.
