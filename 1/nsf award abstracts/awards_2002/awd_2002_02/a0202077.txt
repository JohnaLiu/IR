Abstract    :
              0202077  Rabideau  This research involves adding reactive transport modeling to
              a grid-free flow model, and the decoupling of ground water flow, advection, and
              dispersion. The overall approach is original using modular code design.   A
              modular grid-free ground water model would be able to handle problems with
              multiple spatial and temporal scales.  It should eliminate or lessen
              computational problems that exist with current finite-element/finite-difference
              codes. The code will also take advantage of parallel processing architecture,
              which will help in long-term simulations.  The proposal presents a
              well-organized set of work, and builds on work currently in progress. The model
              testing and benchmarking will be done on a problem that involves multiple
              scales.  The PIs have experience in coding these types of algorithms, and
              experience in sorption and vertical barriers.
