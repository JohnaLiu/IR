Abstract    :
              The Virginia Community College System develops a consortium of two-year
              colleges, industry, and four-year universities to provide students throughout
              Virginia with a consistent set of IT knowledge and skills. The consortium
              integrates into the curriculum industry-desired "value delivery skills," which
              include the employability skills described by the SCANS report and also more
              mathematics and science. The SCANS 2000 Center at Johns Hopkins provides
              guidance for adapting or designing classroom and laboratory activities.
              Assessments with rubrics are developed to measure the extent to which students
              gain the needed competencies. Workshops, along with electronic follow-up,
              educate the faculty in new ways of facilitating the learning of IT knowledge
              and skills. Pilot test activities determine the efficacy of the courses and the
              faculty professional development. Connections are made to high schools through
              Tech Prep.
