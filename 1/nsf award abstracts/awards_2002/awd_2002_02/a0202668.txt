Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will do research on non-linear problems in
              Kirchhoff's theory of elastic rods with the goals of (i) finding, for knotted
              and unknotted closed rods and open rods subject to terminal forces and torques,
              precise analytic representations of equilibrium configurations that show both
              isolated points and intervals of self-contact; (ii) deriving practical
              necessary and sufficient conditions for an equilibrium configuration to be
              stable in the sense that it gives a strict local minimum to elastic energy;
              (iii) obtaining insight into the dependence of bifurcation diagrams on knot
              type and the presence of intrinsic curvature; (iv) understanding the way in
              which the occurrence of plectonemic loops leads to hysteresis in
              torsion-stretching experiments for elastic rods and in single molecule
              manipulation experiments on DNA. The analytical representations of equilibrium
              configurations will be employed to develop a new Metropolis Monte Carlo
              procedure for evaluating partition functions for thermally fluctuating DNA
              molecules subject to specified constraints and end conditions.  Graduate
              students will participate in this research which lies, as described below, at
              the interface between modern continuum mechanics and molecular biology.
              

Each human cell has a meter of DNA in a nucleus that is less than 1 micron
              in diameter. Throughout the life of the cell, its compacted DNA is in a state
              of rapid, yet controlled, activity, because the regulation of life functions
              requires repeated transcription of appropriate portions of the genetic code
              into strands of RNA. The present research project addresses issues in
              theoretical mechanics that must be resolved before one can attain full
              understanding of the way in which highly compacted DNA is made available for
              the processes of transcription, replication, and recombination.
