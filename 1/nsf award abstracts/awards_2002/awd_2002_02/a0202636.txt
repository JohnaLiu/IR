The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will support a ten month research fellowship by
              Dr. Cynthia A. Werner to work with Dr. Fred Bosveld at the Royal Netherland
              Meteorological Institute in De Bilt, The Netherlands.
This project will
              evaluate the CO2 fluxes by instrumenting the Cabauw meteorological tower in the
              Netherlands.  This experiment should yield the first realistic estimates of the
              errors in CO2 flux measurement and in advective CO2 flux. The Cabauw site
              affords a unique opportunity because of its height and lack of surface
              heterogeneity.  Dr. Werner will establish a baseline value for advective flux
              which will determine the minimal amount of error that sites located in more
              complicated terrain can expect due to the advective component.  This baseline
              value is particularly significant because only a few sites have the ability to
              assess the advective componenet and typically this is performed only when very
              large errors are expected.  The data collected will complement research done by
              others studying the carbon cycle and global climate change across Europe.

In
              addition to working with Dr. Bosveld, who is in charge of all measurements made
              at Cabauw, the PI will also work with Dr. Peter Duynkerke of the Institute for
              Marine and Atmospheric Research (IMAU), Dr. Alex Vermeulen of the Energy
              Research center of the Netherlands (ECN).
