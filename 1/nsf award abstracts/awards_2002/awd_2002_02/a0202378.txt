Abstract    :
              Funds from this award will enable young scholars to attend a
workshop entitled,
              "Exclusive Reactions at High Momentum Transfer,"
to be held at Jefferson
              Laboratory (Newport News, VA) May 15-18,
2002.  This workshop will bring
              together both experimental and
theoretical practitioners of this filed both to
              stimulate
cooperative activity and to raise community awareness of
              the
vitality of this field.  Among the subjects covered by this workshop
are:
              wide-angle Compton scattering, large-t meson photo and
electroproduction,
              baryon elastic and transition form factors, and
high-t deuteron
              photoproduction.
