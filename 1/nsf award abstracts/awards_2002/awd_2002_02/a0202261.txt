Abstract    :
              Information Technology (IT) programs in two-year colleges have provided
              personnel qualified for the IT workforce. Yet corporate hiring preferences
              favor those with four-year degrees in almost any field combined with IT
              certificates or courses at the two-year college or two-year college degrees and
              much experience. Present articulated degree programs emphasize business fields
              such as sales and personnel supervision rather than advanced standards-based
              technical skills. This project investigates the extent to which industrial
              support exists for four-year degrees in IT that are consistent with skill
              standards. Upper division skill standards in IT are developed to codify those
              technical and non-technical elements that are important in the selection,
              placement and promotion of IT workers. The clusters of Enterprise System
              Analysis and Integration, Programming, Technical Writing and Database
              Development and Administration are emphasized. The project also investigates
              best practices in the structure and use of conventional articulation models
              between two-year and four-year colleges and the development of a framework for
              offering standards-based upper division technology degrees.
