The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will support a seven month research fellowship
              by Dr. Arek J. Goetz to work with Dr. Pierre Arnoux at the University of
              Marseille in France.

Dr. Goetz will join a group of active researchers at
              the University of Marseille II, Institut de Luminy, and the Center of
              Theoretical Physics, in research pertaining to the dynamics of transformations
              with low symbolic complexity.  In particular, he will explore the relationship
              between the symbolic dynamics induced by invertible piecewise rotations, the
              geometry and fractal structure of the coding partition.  The last month of the
              fellowship will be spent at the University of Exeter in the UK where he will
              join a team of researchers in dynamical systems led by Dr. Peter Ashwin and
              apply results from the theory of piecewise isometries to electrical
              engineering, in particular to the theory of digital filters.  Digital filters
              are computer algorithms used currently in electronic devices such as cell phone
              and voice and image recognition devices.
