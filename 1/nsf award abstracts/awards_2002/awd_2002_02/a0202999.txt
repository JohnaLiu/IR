ABSTRACT

This project is
              devoted to the study of ergodic properties of
nonuniformly hyperbolic systems.
                We focus on almost
hyperbolic systems and some related systems.  An smooth
              dynamical
system is almost hyperbolic if it is hyperbolic everywhere
              except
at a finite set of points.  Such systems may have quite
              different
ergodic behaviors from uniformly hyperbolic systems.
In this
              project we will study existence of equilibrium states,
including SRB measures
              and absolutely continuous invariant
measures in multidimensional spaces; rates
              of convergence to the
equilibrium states for both finite and infinite measure
              cases,
and some related topics such as rates of decay of correlations of
the
              systems and the central limit theorem;  some other ergodic
properties of the
              systems such as stochastic stability, Gibbs
properties, topological
              conjugation. We are also interested in
using these or similar systems to
              construct varies examples of
systems that have given properties, for instance,
              diffeomorphisms
or flows on any manifolds that preserve the
              Riemannian
volume, have nonzero Lyapunov exponents almost everywhere,
              and
have countably many ergodic components.


Ergodic theory concerns the
              statistic behavior of systems.
Ergodic properties of uniformly hyperbolic
              systems were the main
research subject in smooth dynamical systems from 60's
              to 80's.
The behaviors of such systems are regarded as chaotic.
Now
              nonuniformly hyperbolic systems become a main research topic
in the field. 
              This project is devoted to the study of ergodic
properties of almost
              hyperbolic systems and some other related
systems. Almost hyperbolic systems
              are smooth dynamical systems
in which hyperbolic conditions are violated at
              only finitely
number of points.  These systems lie on the boundary of the
              set
of uniformly hyperbolic systems, and are the simplest but
nontrivial
              nonuniformly hyperbolic systems.  Earlier studies on
examples of such systems,
              such as systems on the intervals and
torus, show that some ergodic properties
              may change dramatically.
In this project we try to develop some theorems for
              general
almost hyperbolic systems rather than individual examples.
