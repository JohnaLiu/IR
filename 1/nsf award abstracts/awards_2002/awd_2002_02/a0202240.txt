Abstract    :
              The Maricopa Advanced Technology Education Center (MATEC) is transitioning to
              serve as the NSF's leading dissemination center for skill standards, ideas,
              materials, contacts, and mentoring in the field of semiconductor industry
              education. Since 1996 MATEC has collaborated with industry and educators to
              increase the number of semiconductor manufacturing technology (SMT) programs
              from 32 to 80; create the industry's first national skill standards; and
              develop and distribute 44 modules of learning materials through a unique
              electronic delivery system. As a dissemination center, MATEC's goals are 1) to
              motivate at least 50 percent of the nation's SMT faculty to adopt the MATEC
              learning system by 2005, in part by developing an industry-accepted ChipReady
              job-screening assessment; and 2) to broadcast best practices and new ideas
              among SMT faculty nationwide. MATEC continues to use the dissemination vehicles
              developed in the last six years (adopter and topic workshops, Web site,
              quarterly print newsletter and e-mail bulletins, conference attendance, faculty
              development, and sponsorship of the industry's most influential annual
              workforce development conference). MATEC is also developing five new
              dissemination vehicles (Learning Invention Lab, lesson plan recognition,
              exemplary instructor video, collaboration with Arizona State University East,
              collaboration with industry workforce developers).
