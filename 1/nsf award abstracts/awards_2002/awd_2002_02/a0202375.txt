Abstract    :
              Project ProBase
Project Summary
Project ProBase (Problem-based technology
              curriculum) will develop an innovative
set of 8 secondary level,
              technology-rich curriculum units based on a validated set of
bridge
              competencies. The materials will be targeted for the 11th and 12th grade levels
              and
will be designed to develop a comprehensive technical foundation for
              post-secondary
community college technician education. The materials will be
              designed to be delivered
using a constuctivist approach that utilizes a series
              of technological problem solving
activities. ProBase will provide
              pre-technical high school students with a comprehensive
curriculum, designed
              to prepare them to enter community college technician programs.
ProBase will
              develop and field-test curriculum materials designed to fill the gap
              between
(a) the curriculum content standards developed at the national level
              (i.e., Standards for
Technological Literacy, the National Science Education
              Standards, and the Curriculum
Standards for School Mathematics) and (b) the
              entry-level knowledge and skills needed
by students entering community college
              technical education programs. This curriculum
will focus on core concepts
              identified in the Standards for Technological Literacy as well
as a set of
              Bridge Competencies identified by the Community College consortium
involved in
              the project. The materials will be produced and disseminated by
              the
International Technology Education Association.
