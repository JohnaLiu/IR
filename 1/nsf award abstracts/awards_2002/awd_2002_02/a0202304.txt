Abstract    :
              This project will provide the genome sequence of a Bacillus anthracis strain 
              isolated from the recent anthrax outbreak in Florida.  This sequence can then
              be compared to that of other strains of Bacillus anthracis.  Such comparisons
              will help investigators  in their quest to understand the phylogenetic
              diversity of Bacillus anthracis  and may point to genomic factors that  affect 
              virulence.
