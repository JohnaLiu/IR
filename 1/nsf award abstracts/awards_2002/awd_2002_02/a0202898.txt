Abstract    :
              This award is to support research that will develop new and extend existing tree
              ring records from the North Pacific Rim.  These data will be analyzed to
              provide multi-century time series of coastal and oceanic conditions.

Field
              work will be undertaken to collect samples from northern Alaska, Canada, Russia
              and northern Japan during the first two years of the study.  Ring width
              measurements will be cross-dated visual, graphical and computer assisted
              techniques.  Tree ring data generated during this project will be used to
              evaluate several climate indices and reconstruct North Pacific sea surface
              temperatures.

The broader impacts of this proposed research are that it will
              lead to a better understanding of natural climate variability for the North
              Pacific region which in turn is critical for identifying anthropogenic signals
              in the short instrumental climate records.  This information will help the
              community understand future climate change scenarios.
