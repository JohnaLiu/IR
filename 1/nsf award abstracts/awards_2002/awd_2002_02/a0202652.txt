Abstract    :
              Although a great deal is known about how individuals react to personal
              bereavement, less is known about how individuals respond to collective loss.
              The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 were of such a magnitude as to
              significantly affect millions of people living in the United States,
              irrespective of whether they knew anyone personally who died or who narrowly
              escaped death. The purpose of this small grant for exploratory research is to
              examine the extent to which collective loss reactions may be similar to
              well-documented reactions to personal bereavement, such as grief and
              depression, or to survivor reactions, such as survivor guilt and anxiety. The
              project examines the levels and kinds of affective reactions experienced in the
              immediate aftermath of the attacks as well as personality and background
              variables that may be uniquely associated with these different reactions. Given
              the on-going nature of terrorist threat and the need to understand how
              reactions to traumatic events may unfold over time, college students will
              complete questionnaires at 3-6 weeks after the September 11 attacks and again
              six months later. Results from the study will expand theoretical understanding
              of how individuals, even those thousands of miles away from the actual event,
              react to collective loss.  In turn, this understanding may aid intervention
              efforts directed at coping with such loss.
