Abstract    :
              Faculty of Florida Community College in Jacksonville (FCCJ) and Gulf Coast
              Community College (GCCC) are adapting and implementing curricula developed by
              the Advanced Integrated Manufacturing Center in Dayton, Ohio (AIM Center). The
              project enables students to have virtual work experiences, and provides faculty
              development for regional college instructors and high school teachers. The new
              curricula, adapted to the Florida Community College System, features a modular
              design that allows students to complete their education in a compressed time
              while gaining real world experiences in new laboratories. Existing
              collaborations with industry groups, state universities, public schools, and
              workforce development organizations are helping to recruit and retain students,
              particularly those from underrepresented groups. Faculty professional
              development opportunities are being provided through the new Advanced
              Technology Center developed at the Downtown Campus of the College and with
              partner universities and the AIM Center at Sinclair Community College.
              Follow-up activities at FCCJ and GCCC involve both academic and technical
              faculty in collaborative curriculum development and implementation of
              supportive learning opportunities, such as integrated problem-based learning
              and learning communities congruent with the AIM Center's modular,
              competency-based approach.
