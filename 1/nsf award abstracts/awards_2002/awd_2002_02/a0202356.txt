Abstract    :
              The investigator and his colleagues study interactions between Representation
              Theory, Knot Theory, and Mathematical Physics.  These fields are interrelated
              and motivate each others' development.  Representation theory, among other
              things, helps mathematical physicists predict the existence of particles.  It
              has played a significant role in describing symmetry and in providing a
              language for conformal field theory and statistical mechanics.  In turn,
              mathematical physics has led Representation Theorists to new conjectures,
              interesting generalizations, and fascinating results.  Invariants of knots and
              links such as the polynomials of Kauffman and Jones arise as the trace of
              representations of certain algebras (Hecke algebras, Birman-Wenzl-Murakami
              algebras, group algebras of braid groups). And of course, knot theory is
              related to mathematical physics through concepts such as statistical mechanics.
              
 
This conference fosters a dialogue between the Researchers, and helps
              students, in particular graduate students, and recent Ph.Ds become acquainted
              with the areas of research that is of significant importance to high
              performance computing. This workshop brings together experts in many different
              areas of Mathematics, Mathematical physics, and quantum computation, etc. This
              is helping research in areas that could help creation of quantum computers.
