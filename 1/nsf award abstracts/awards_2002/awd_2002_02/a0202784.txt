Abstract    :
              CHE-0202784
PI: McHale, Jeanne L.

In this project funded by the Experimental
              Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, McHale will conduct a
              series of spectroscopic investigations of interfacial electron transfer and
              chromophore aggregation. Resonance Raman intensity analysis and absorption and
              fluorescence spectroscopies will be used to investigate the sub-picosecond
              dynamics of interfacial charge-transfer from excited electronic states of dyes
              adsorbed on semiconductor surfaces. Details of the electron injection by dye
              sensitizers adsorbed on colloidal titanium oxide nanoparticles suspended in
              aqueous and non-aqueous solution will be investigated. Along with electronic
              absorption and emission spectroscopy, resonance Raman experiments will also
              probe the nature of the electronic coupling of the dye and the
              semiconductor.

This research deals with fundamental photophysical processes
              of dyes adsorbed on semiconductor surfaces. The results of the work will be of
              interest in the development of dye-sensitized solar cells and related
              photoelectrochemical, photovoltaic, and photocatalytic devices.
Students will
              participate in this research and acquire research skills in a technologically
              important area.
