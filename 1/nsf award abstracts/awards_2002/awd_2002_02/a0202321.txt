Abstract    :
              The investigator and his collaborator work on
the topology of complex algebraic
              maps, with applications
to algebraic cycles
and to non-algebraic maps.
The
              study of the relations between the topology
of the domain and target of a
              map
is interesting and has broad applications
in the fields of geometry and
              topology.
The investigator works on:
1) a topological and Hodge-theoretic
              proof of the so-called 
Decomposition Theorem for algebraic maps, 
2) finding
              the topological  obstructions to the 
validity of the theorem for other maps,
              
3) computing  intersection forms arising from maps in significant 
cases,
              and 
4) applications of the Decomposition
Theorem to algebraic
              cycles.
Several new methods are being introduced 
as a result of these
              studies.


The term ``algebraic maps" above is a technical term
for
              polynomial equations. 
Algebraic geometry is the discipline devoted to their
              study.
It is an ancient subject rooted in the early achievements of
              
humanity, like the wheel, the Egyptians' elliptical flowers 
arrangements
              and Archimedes' burning parabolic mirrors.
Circles, ellipses and parabolas
              arise from the polynomial 
equations we study in high school. They are both
              beautiful
and ubiquitous in nature as they describe many natural 
phenomena,
              from the motion of planets to the shape of leaves 
and flowers, to the
              behavior of microscopic particles.
The funded project is strongly inclined
              towards pure research
and proposes to study the deeper properties
of the
              solutions to more complicated algebraic equations.
As it has always been the
              case, pure and applied mathematics
will influence each other and new abstract
              ideas will fuel the 
progress of applications.
