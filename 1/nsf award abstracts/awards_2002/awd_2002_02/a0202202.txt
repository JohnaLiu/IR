Abstract    :
              
This project is developing and disseminating low-cost laboratory apparatus and
              innovative, competency-based, activity-based, interdisciplinary curriculum
              materials that integrate mathematics, science, and technology. The project
              objectives are to:
1. Develop four curriculum modules incorporating 24
              Authentic Learning Tasks to be distributed to high school and community college
              faculty using inquiry-based activities that apply rigorous mathematics and
              science to realistic technological tasks.
2. Offer four in-depth summer
              institutes based on the curriculum modules to 72 Ohio high school and community
              college faculty.

The project is implemented in two major phases: Curriculum
              Development and Summer Institutes.
Phase 1: Four curriculum modules
              incorporating laboratory apparatus and innovative, competency-based,
              activity-based learning through 24 Authentic Learning Tasks (a series of
              discrete learning events that build experience and competencies related to the
              module's goals) are being created in the following curriculum modules: Algebra,
              General Mathematics and Trigonometry, Science/Physics, Technology and
              Electronics. Leading developers of hardware and software are participating in
              this phase. 
Phase 2: A series of four institutes are being offered for 72
              mathematics, science, and technology high school and two-year college faculty
              in Ohio.
