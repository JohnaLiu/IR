Abstract    :
              RECRUIT is an experimental alternative science and mathematics teacher
              certification program that aims to increase the number of secondary science and
              mathematics teachers from underrepresented populations in the profession and
              simultaneously enhance the quality of their preparation. RECRUIT emphasizes two
              central themes: quality and innovation in science and mathematics teacher
              preparation. Specifically, the program: 1) creates a venue to recruit and
              prepare qualified secondary science and mathematics teachers from populations
              that are underrepresented in the teaching profession. These populations
              comprise recent and
advanced science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
              (STEM) graduates, and mid-career scientists, mathematicians, and industry
              personnel contemplating a shift into pre-college teaching, 2) develops an
              exemplary science and mathematics teacher preparation program that is
              consistent with recommendations and goals put forth in recent national reform
              documents in teacher preparation. Toward achieving this end, the program
              features: a) extensive long-term collaboration between education faculty, STEM
              faculty, and school personnel toward the preparation of reform-minded
              reflective teachers; b) a support community comprising prospective teachers,
              veteran mentor teachers, and education and STEM faculty, that aims to provide a
              seamless transition from teacher preparation into teaching; c) an extended
              induction, support, and professional development period that extends beyond
              initial coursework and training, that aims to develop participants' pedagogical
              content knowledge and increase their retention rate in the profession; and d)
              advanced coursework in both content and pedagogy pursued after participants
              have spent time teaching in collaborating districts, with the aim of helping
              participants address advanced instructional outcomes, such as higher order and
              critical thinking skills, inquiry, and nature of science and mathematics, and
              3) contributes through an intensive research component to our knowledge base
              on: a) developing science and mathematics teachers' cognition, and subject
              matter, pedagogical, and pedagogical content knowledge; b) creating and
              sustaining communities to support and facilitate the professional growth of
              teachers; and c) developing effective models for collaboration between
              education faculty, STEM faculty, and school personnel through investigating the
              disciplinary and professional commitments and barriers that often impede such
              desirable collaboration.
