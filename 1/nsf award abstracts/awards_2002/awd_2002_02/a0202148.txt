The PI proposes to  study   computations and
              applications of
spectral invariants, in
particular the  eta-invariant of
              generalized Dirac operators,  to
problems in geometric topology and geometry. 
              The focus will be to
use analytic  and differential geometric machinery  to
              study spectral
flow, the  Atiyah-Patodi-Singer rho-invariant,  and
              the
$SU(3)$-gauge theoretic Casson invariant.  The main goal is to 
develop
              usable cut-and-paste machinery for spectral invariants using
the theory of
              boundary-value problems for Dirac operators.


The PI's work in pure
              mathematics has as its goal the solution  and
clarification of geometric
              problems in 3 dimensions. The setting of
3 dimensions on the one hand is
              familiar to all of us since the 
universe we live in is 3-dimensional. But
              geometric problems in this 
area turn out to be very difficult for the odd
              reason that in such 
low dimensions there is "not enough room to move."  The
              PI's approach 
to the area is to combine traditional 3 dimensional techniques
              with
methods from other mathematical disciplines such as differential
              
geometry and analysis.
