Abstract    :
              This multi-year collaborative project is developing, pilot testing,
              institutionalizing, and disseminating a comprehensive program to recruit,
              prepare, and retain future K-12 mathematics teachers with deep content
              knowledge, effective pedagogical skills, and technological capabilities
              necessary to enable all K-12 students to attain high standards of mathematical
              achievement. Project partners include the Kansas State University (KSU) Center
              for Science Education, KSU's College of Education and College of Arts and
              Sciences, and three school districts: Geary County Unified School District,
              Kansas City, Kansas Unified School District, and Manhattan-Ogden Unified School
              District. The project team features mathematicians, mathematics educators, and
              K-12 mathematics teachers, to ensure that teacher preparation is part of the
              continuum of teacher education that extends through the induction years and
              beyond. Five key components are: (1) innovative recruitment initiatives to
              increase the number of traditional and nontraditional students entering K-12
              mathematics teacher education (including minority and bilingual students, STEM
              majors, community college students, and professionals); (2) a strong foundation
              in challenging mathematics content and technological knowledge based on state
              and national mathematics content standards linked to effective pedagogical
              strategies; (3) effective research-based methods of teaching focused on
              national and state mathematics teaching standards, current research, and best
              practice; (4) extensive clinical field experiences teaching diverse learners in
              a variety of Professional Development Schools under the guidance of mentor
              teachers; and (5) continuous support and assistance for graduates during their
              initial three years of teaching to facilitate their transition from teacher
              preparation to practice.  The project builds on established collaborations with
              mathematics faculty from two-year feeder colleges to strengthen the mathematics
              courses future teachers take at these colleges.
