The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will support a twenty-four month research
              fellowship by Dr. Alka Agrawal to work with Dr. Robert Menard at the Pasteur
              Institute in Paris, France.

This project will involve the study of the basis
              of the irradiated sporozoite vaccine, which remains the most effective malaria
              vaccine to date.  Irradiated sporozoites are able to infect liver cells, but in
              the liver they fail to develop into stages of the parasite that later infect
              red blood cells.  The PI will develop a technique for identifying genes in P.
              berghei, a species that infects rodents, that are essential for parasite
              differentiation in the host liver.  She will then test the defective mutants
              for their ability to serve as attenuated malaria vaccines.  The expectation is
              that a number of genes will be found that are essential for parasite
              development in the liver, as well as parasite mutants that could serve as
              attenuated vaccines or the starting point for new vaccines.

The Pasteur
              Institute is well known for its focus on infectious disease and has several
              investigators working on malaria.
