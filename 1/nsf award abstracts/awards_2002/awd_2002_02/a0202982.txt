Abstract    :
              	The investigator will continue his study of L-functions.  Specifically the
              problem of a 'subconvex' estimate for general automorphic L-functions.  These
              have wide applications to classical problems in number theory (e.g. Hilbert's
              11-th problem on representing integers in a number field by a quadratic form)
              and to eigenfunctions on arithmetic surfaces.  The use of the families of
              L-functions and symmetries associated with them is crucial.

	This project is
              concerned with the study of mathematical objects called zeta functions.  They
              encode deep information about the arithmetic and geometry which lie at their
              definition.  Understanding the functions has far reaching applications to the
              theory of whole numbers (and prime numbers) and more surprisingly to some
              foundational problems in quantum theory.
