Abstract    :
              This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research by Professor Carl J. Carrano at Southwest Texas State
              University to study a family of ligands that allows for the systematic variance
              of donor atom, charge, steric bulk, hydrogen-bonding and other factors that can
              have an important effect on metal-catalyzed biotransformations.  Ligand effects
              on oxygen atom transfer reactions between acceptors such as organophosphines
              and models for molybdoenzymes will be systematically studied.  New sulfur-rich
              model complexes to more closely mimic enzyme active sites will be prepared. 
              Pentaacoordinate complexes of iron will be prepared as models for several
              non-heme iron oxygenase enzymes in order to determine the effects of the donor
              atom set, charge, and hydrogen bonding and other factors that control
              oxygenation versus oxidation.  Pseudotetrahedral iron complexes will be
              synthesized and studied as models for peptide deformylases and compared with
              analogous complexes of Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) in order to determine why
              Fe(II) rather than Zn(II) is employed by nature in these unique hydrolytic
              enzymes.

Relatively small complexes of metal ions will be prepared that
              simulate the structure and function of metal active sites in enzymes.  Studying
              these complexes will help to elucidate the fundamental nature of the function
              of the metal ions in a number of important enzymes.
