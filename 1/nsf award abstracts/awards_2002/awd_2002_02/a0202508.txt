              ABSTRACT DMS - 0202508.

The first proposed project is to understand the
              topology of complete manifolds 
whose Ricci curvature is bounded from below by
              a negative multiple of the bottom 
of the spectrum of the Laplace operator. 
              In this case, the bottom of the spectrum 
is assumed to be positive.  The
              second project of the Principal Investigator is to 
investigate the size of
              the space of harmonic functions with polynomial growth on 
complete manifolds
              with non-negative sectional curvature.  In particular, 
the primary goal is to
              prove that the dimension of the space of harmonic functions 
of polynomial
              growth with degree at most d is bounded by the dimension of an 
analogous
              space in Euclidean space of the same dimension.  The third project is 
to
              understand the geometry of stable minimal hypersurfaces of Euclidean space.
              
More generally, he would like to study minimal hypersurfaces with have finite
              index.  
The PI also proposes to support a postdoc, Dr. Xiaofeng Sun, in his
              research projects.  
Dr. Sun proposes to study the regularity theory of
              harmonic maps into a metric space. 


These proposed projects have the
              unified theme of using analytical techniques in 
studying the underlining
              geometric spaces.  In many instances, topological and 
geometrical conclusions
              can be drawn by detail analysis of solutions of some 
appropriate partial
              differential equations defined on the space.
