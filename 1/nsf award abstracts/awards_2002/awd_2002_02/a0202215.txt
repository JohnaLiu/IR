Abstract    :
              Southern Rings is a consortium of three two-year colleges and a four-year
              college to establish a regional center to increase the number of
              technologically-trained information technology technicians in south Georgia.
              The planning process is to define and develop roles of industrial partners and
              secondary schools, an effective co-principal investigator structure, a
              multi-institutional approach to academic programs and content delivery,
              technical support for activities, and management and evaluation plans. The
              process determines specifics of the models to ensure scalability and
              sustainability of the efforts and to extend them to rural communities that have
              no institutions of higher education.
