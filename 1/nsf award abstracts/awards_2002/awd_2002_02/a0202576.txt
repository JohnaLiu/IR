Abstract    :
              The science/technology industries in and around the service area of Los Angeles
              Trade Technical College (LATTC) have long created a demand for chemical
              technicians that greatly exceeded the number of graduates from our Chemical
              Technology program. The Chemical Technology program at our school has a
              thirty-two year track record in the preparation and training of its graduates
              for immediate employment as highly skilled technicians in applied
              chemistry/physics, as well as in providing an adequate foundation for students
              seeking bachelors' degrees. Employers, as well as faculty, recognize the
              program is rendered less effective than it should be by the many applicants who
              fail to qualify for the program as a result of inadequate high school
              preparation, especially those from inner city schools and minorities of
              immigrant backgrounds. Employers also reject many high school applicants
              seeking work, as they are grossly ill equipped academically to handle the
              workplace environment. We are attempting to remedy the problem by launching a
              high school science technology program based on Science in a Technical World, a
              NSF-funded project product from the American Chemical Society, with an alliance
              of local employers, the college, and the inner city high schools. Our goal is
              to develop a model by which two-year colleges can take a leadership role in
              outreach programs which encourage disadvantaged high school students to choose
              science and science-based technology careers. Our objectives are to assure
              that: (1) 180 high school students demonstrate a 10% increase in basic science
              and technical knowledge through participation in this program; (2) 20% of
              students completing this training program enter a two-year science-based
              technology program at a community college upon completion of their high school
              education, (3) six high school science teachers from the same schools complete
              a vocational applications of science knowledge and skills training program, and
              (4) all participating students complete an introduction to instrumentation and
              a math lab that prepares them for the industry work environment or a two-year
              college chemistry-based technology program.
