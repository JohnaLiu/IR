Abstract    :
              This award supports purchase of a state-of-the-art scanning laser confocal
              microscopy system that includes an upright microscope with motorized stage and
              multiple lasers.  The instrument is equipped for use of methods requiring oil
              or water immersion, and has fast scanning capabilities suitable for study of
              motile cells undergoing rapid physiological changes.  Research projects that
              will employ the microscope include studies of sperm-egg interactions and the
              physiological and biochemical events surrounding fertilization in marine and
              freshwater organisms.  Other projects include studies of metabolic depression
              in cells connected with intracellular translocation of a molecular chaperone
              after environmental challenges, and  studies of photobleaching of corals in the
              tropics and its relationship to DNA damage caused by ultraviolet light.  In
              addition to its role in research, the instrument will be used by undergraduate
              and graduate students in formal courses and related training activities. The
              instrument will be located in the Fluorescence Imaging Facility at the Bodega
              Marine Laboratory along with other instruments used for complementary methods. 
              The instrument will be available for use by investigators and students from the
              University's main campus as well as those at  the Laboratory.
