Abstract    :
              
This award provides funds to support the participation of graduate students in
              a summer research conference organized by the Southern Regional Council on
              Statistics (SRCOS) and the American Statistical Association. The conference
              will be held on June 2-5, 2002, in Natchez, Mississippi. The objectives of the
              conference are to bring together senior researchers, junior researchers and
              advanced graduate students to focus on several current research areas in
              statistics and to discuss some current and future issues in statistical
              education and training. Sessions are organized around the topics of Statistical
              Education and Biostatistics, Statistics for Dependent Data and Environmental
              Statistics. Leading researchers will present new developments in an environment
              that is conducive to the development of new human resources.
