     The investigator, together with colleagues and
              students,
studies a variety of problems in computer science,
              information
theory, and applied probability.  These have the common
              feature
that they can be reduced to solving recursion or
              differential
equations.  Sometimes these equations can be solved exactly
              using
transform methods.  Then one can obtain asymptotic information
              by
expanding the results using methods such as the Laplace or saddle
point
              methods, the Euler-Maclaurin and Poisson summation
formulas, Watson
              transformations, etc.  Many applied problems of
interest (especially nonlinear
              ones) cannot be solved exactly.
For these the investigator and colleagues
              develop appropriate
asymptotic techniques that analyze directly the
              governing
equations.  These are variants of applied mathematics methods,
such
              as WKB expansions and matched asymptotic expansions.  The
latter are
              especially useful for asymptotic problems that involve
several different
              scales.  The focus is on problems in
combinatorics, data compression, analysis
              of algorithms, digital
and binary trees, queuing, and coding.
     Computers
              play a progressively greater role in all of our
lives.  Important problems in
              computer science include sorting and
searching, efficient data storage, and
              data compression.  To
decide on what is a good method to search out a given
              item in
some database, or a good method for storing music or video
              with
minimal use of memory, it is important to analyze the method
              or
algorithm.  For example, one might ask for the average search
time, or for
              the likelihood that the search time will be very
long, exceeding some
              prescribed tolerance.  Such questions involve
the "analysis of algorithms."  
              They can frequently be reduced to
solving certain classes of equations.  The
              investigator and
colleagues develop mathematical tools for obtaining solutions
              of
these equations, either exact ones or accurate
              approximations.
Approximations are often sufficient, because for example
              the
searching problem is most important if the total number of items
stored
              is very large.  This "largeness" shows up as a parameter in
the governing
              equation that facilitates its solution.  Related
mathematical problems arise
              in other important areas such as
molecular biology and communications, and the
              investigators'
methods and results should thus find applicability to a
              wide
range of problems.
