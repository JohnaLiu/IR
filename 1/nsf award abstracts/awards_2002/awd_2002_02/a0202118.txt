Abstract    :
              This award is in support of the first Gordon Research Conference (GRC) meeting
              on Photosensory Receptors and Signal Transduction to be held May 19-24, 2002 at
              the GRC site in Barga, Italy. 

This new conference was developed and
              approved in view of the recent breakthrough discoveries of new photosensory
              receptors and current rapid progress on their activation and signaling
              mechanisms. The focus is on molecular mechanisms of receptor phototransduction,
              and the conference brings together investigators of structure/function of
              archaeal, eubacterial, eukaryotic microbial, plant, and animal photoreceptors.
              The meeting will provide a very much-needed opportunity to exchange information
              and ideas and for investigators to become aware of the diverse and incisive
              molecular tools available in this fast-moving area of research. 

It is
              expected that the conference will stimulate exciting discussion of emerging
              insights on photoreceptor evolution, molecular mechanisms, photosignal
              transduction principles, and the most engaging mysteries on the cutting edge of
              photosensory reception in biology.
