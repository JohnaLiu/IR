The International Research Fellowship Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.

This award will support a twelve month research
              fellowship by Dr. David A. Tallmon to work with Dr. Gordon Luikart at Joseph
              Fourier University's Lab of Alpine Population Biology in Grenoble, France and
              Dr. Mark Beaumont at Reading University in the UK.

Their project involves
              the evaluation of the power, bias and precision of new methods to detect
              cryptic population barriers, low levels of current gene flow among populations,
              and natural selection in threatened populations. The PI and his collaborators
              will use available shareware programs to generate genetic data from simulated
              populations with known demographic and evolutionary histories.  They will
              analyze this data with other existing statistical programs to do the
              evaluation.  The results will be published to aid those working on the
              conservation of natural populations.

Dr. Beaumont is a world leader in the
              application of Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches to conservation
              genetics problems.  The Laboratory of Alpine Population Biology is
              internationally known for its pioneering research in the application of
              molecular techniques to population genetics.
