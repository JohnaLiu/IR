Abstract    :
              A critical and timely issue facing the U.S. Food and Agricultural system in the
              21st century is how to provide highly technical and qualified agricultural
              individuals to meet demands of the industry within the new millennium. To
              address the region's agricultural industry requirements, Murray State
              University has partnered with three community colleges located in Henderson,
              Hopkinsville, and Madisonville, Kentucky, to form Agriculture Consortium for
              Comprehensive Education, Service and Support of Project ACCESS. The project is
              focusing on providing a solid mechanism to develop a highly trained and
              qualified agricultural workforce for western Kentucky, and neighboring regions.
              This well-trained and qualified agricultural cohort is being developed mainly
              through higher-level agriscience technology curriculums at the associate and
              baccalaureate levels. A major goal of the project is to increase access for
              students and agriculture workers into these modified agriscience technology
              programs by developing a joint, cutting edge, and articulated agriscience
              technology baccalaureate program. Other specific goals are to: (1) to
              strengthen and raise the level of educational expertise in the national
              agriculture system, (2) to provide increased student and agricultural worker
              "ACCESS" into associate and baccalaureate agriscience degree programs, and (3)
              to strengthen a regional and state agriculture system to be highly competitive
              in the global economy. Project objectives are to: (1) develop a wide-entry,
              multiple-exit and seamless agriculture educational system from high school
              through the baccalaureate level in the articulation partnership service region
              by June, 2005 (2) continue to raise the current academic level of Associate
              degree programs to allow for a successful transition of an increasing number of
              students into the workforce and/or a baccalaureate degree program by June, 2005
              (3) develop an articulated joint baccalaureate Agriscience technology
              curriculum by August, 2003, and (4) increase the current matriculation rate of
              western Kentucky students into all educational levels of Agriscience technology
              by 25% by June, 2005.
