Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the role of stretched magnetic field lines as a
              mechanism for the loss of relativistic electrons from the radiation belts. 
              Relativistic electron precipitation into the ionosphere can be divided into two
              categories, brief microbursts lasting for less than a second and precipitation
              bands lasting for more than a second.  Microbursts have been extensively
              studied, but the physics behind the precipitation bands have not received much
              attention.  This project will focus on the role that the stretching of magnetic
              field lines has on the creation of the precipitation bands.  A statistical
              database of precipitation data from the SAMPEX satellite will be used.  In
              order to examine the effect of magnetic field line stretching, the Tsyganenko
              magnetic field models will be used.
