This
              award provides partial support for students and active research
mathematicians
              and scientists with limited means of support to attend
and participate in the
              2002, 2003, and 2004 meetings of the Midwest
Geometry Conference.  The award
              together with other funding will cover
all expenses of the plenary
              speakers.

The 2002 conference will be held on the main campus of the
              University
of North Dakota (April 26-28) and will be sponsored by the NSF,
              North
Dakota EPSCoR, North Dakota State University, and the University
              of
North Dakota.  The conference will include the following four sessions
and
              speakers:

1.  Lie Groups and Geometry. Speakers: Jiri Dadok (Indiana), C.
              Robin Graham 
(Univ. of Washington), and Bernhard Kroetz (Ohio State)
2. 
              Quantum Geometry and Topology. Speakers: Abhay Ashtekar (Penn State,
              Physics),
Louis Kauffman (Univ. of Illinois at Chicago), and Jack Morava
              (Johns Hopkins Univ.)
3.  Geometric PDE. Speakers: Sigurd Angenent
              (Wisconsin), Bennett Chow (Univ. of California, San Diego),
4.  Gravitation.
              Speakers: Peter van Nieuwenhuizen (SUNY Stony Brook, Physics),
Andrew Waldron
              (Univ. of California, Davis)

The organizers expect to recruit two additional
              speakers.  Further
information is available at
              http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/math/mgc2002

The 2003 conference will take
              place at Washington University in
St. Louis, probably in May.  Gary Jensen, of
              Washington University, is
the lead organizer.  Tentative conference plans
              include sessions on
the following four topics:
1.  Three-manifolds,
              hyperbolic geometry, and geometric group theory
2.  Geometry, analysis, and
              probability on discrete groups
3.  Minimal submanifolds
4.  Surface
              immersions in space

The University of Arkansas will host the 2004 conference
              sometime in
2004, most likely in the spring.  John Ryan, of the University
              of
Arkansas, will be the lead organizer.  A tentative list of topics for
the
              conference is as follows:
1.  Nonlinear analysis on manifolds and metric
              spaces
2.  Spinor geometry
3.  Geometric group theory
4.  Non-commutative
              differential geometry

Organizers of the 2003 and 2004 conferences will
              develop more detailed
plans in the months immediately preceding the respective
              conferences.
