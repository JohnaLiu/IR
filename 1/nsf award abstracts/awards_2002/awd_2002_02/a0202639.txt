Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to support the Wayne State University group's
              fraction of a collaborative effort on the research and development of hardware
              and reconstruction algorithms for charged particle tracking at a future Linear
              Collider.  The collaboration consists of the University of California at Santa
              Cruz, University of Colorado, Indiana University, University of Michigan, Wayne
              State University, and Yale University

Brought together in this group from
              the participating institutions are experts in tracking detectors, both in the
              hardware aspects of such detectors and in tracking and reconstruction
              algorithms.  The aim of the research is to specify the tracking system for a
              Linear Collider detector by determining the requirements that a list of
              interesting benchmark collider processes put on the detector design.

The PIs
              and a post-doc will explore a Silicon Drift Detector (SDD) array as the
              tracking device for Linear Collider detector.  The main physics interest is the
              study of Higgs production and properties through quark tagging and the physics
              at the top-antitop threshold.
