DDR:  Adult Consequences of
              Participation in Youth Subculture

	This dissertation research will
              investigate the life histories of early participants in the Los Angeles white
              supremacist subculture.  The results will supplement our knowledge of how early
              social movement participation affects later politics and life outcomes.  Past
              studies of the long term consequences of social movement participation have
              focused almost exclusively on liberal and leftist social movements.  This study
              will investigate similar consequences but for a white supremacist movement. 
              Political, occupational, marital, and criminal outcomes will be investigated in
              follow-up in-depth interviews with at least 25 men who were members of such
              white supremacists movements as youths prior to 1990.
