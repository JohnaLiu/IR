Abstract    :
              The Tennessee Information Technology (IT) Exchange Center provides an effective
              workforce capacity building system by increasing the IT educational strength in
              a consortium of two year colleges, four year colleges, secondary schools and
              industries in North Central Tennessee. The goal is to develop a sustainable
              Center to meet need by industry for a qualified IT workforce. Faculty and
              students in long-term relationships with experts from industry create real
              world scenarios based on industrial needs and use them as the basis for
              instruction in IT courses. The learning strategies are developed in workshops
              at the Center for Learning and Teaching at Vanderbilt University. The cases are
              used in high school academies to interest high school students in IT careers. A
              web site provides information about the availability and content of education
              and training programs in the region, a clearinghouse of job opportunities and
              regular communications among partners. Regional stakeholder forums bring
              industry and educators together to develop a shared vision based upon research
              for effective delivery of instruction. The audience includes both students in
              educational institutions and re-careering workers.
