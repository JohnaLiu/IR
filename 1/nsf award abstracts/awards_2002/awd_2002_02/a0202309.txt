	The main focus of this project is on the asymptotic analysis of
              statistical mechanical models of turbulence, using powerful techniques in the
              theory of large deviations as well as other areas of analysis. The research
              will consider a number of problems, including the following: (1) a detailed
              study of the equivalence and nonequivalence of statistical mechanical ensembles
              for a wide range of models of turbulence; (2) an investigation of
              central-limit-type fluctuations of the stochastic processes arising in the
              large deviation analysis of the various ensembles; (3) a new approach, based on
              large deviation results for Gaussian measures, to the asymptotic analysis of
              soliton turbulence governed by the nonlinear Schroedinger equation; (4) a
              refinement, based on ideas arising in the study of nonequivalence of ensembles,
              of classical results due to Arnold on the nonlinear stability of flows for a
              class of partial differential equations governing turbulence phenomena; (5) an
              analysis of a random walk model having applications to queueing theory,
              communication theory, and stochastic approximation. 
	In the context of
              problems (1)-(4) the principal investigator will develop mathematical tools
              that can be applied to one of the great unsolved problems of the physical
              sciences, which is the understanding of turbulent fluid flows. In this project
              the inherent unpredictability and randomness of turbulent flows are studied via
              sophisticated probabilistic models based on the formalism of statistical
              mechanics. The models are analyzed using techniques in the theory of large
              deviations and probability theory, convex analysis, partial differential
              equations, and other areas.
