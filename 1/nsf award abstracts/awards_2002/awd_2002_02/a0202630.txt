This award supports a one-year collaborative research project
              between Professor Shirley Dyke at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri
              and Professor Masato Abe of the University of Tokyo in Japan.  The researchers
              will undertake a program of engineering research experiences for undergraduates
              in advanced technology in Japan.  It will focus on structural control,
              structural health monitoring, innovative materials, etc. for the mitigation of
              damage to structures when subjected to severe dynamic loading.  The program
              will support a total of eight students from institutions around the country to
              spend approximately one summer month in Japan conducting an independent
              research project that is relevant to their ongoing research in the U.S.  The
              participants will likely include minorities and women.  The remainder of the
              summer would be spent at their host institution in the US conducting research
              activities.  Participants will prepare a paper on their research outcomes and
              give a short presentation at a colloquium.    
 
Current research pertaining
              to these advanced topics in structural engineering would be significantly
              enhanced through input from creative young minds.  Given the opportunity to
              participate in research experiences, students discover that they are excited by
              the challenges they encounter, and intrigued by the innovative ideas and
              technological advancements brought about by their research.  Research is also
              an excellent avenue for increasing students' enthusiasm to pursue advanced
              degrees.  The program will add an international dimension to the development of
              undergraduate researchers.  The exposure to research excellence abroad and the
              early experience with international collaboration will greatly enhance the
              future career opportunities of the participants.  The program will also
              encourage collaborative research projects and the initiation of new
              international collaborative efforts in advanced technology.
