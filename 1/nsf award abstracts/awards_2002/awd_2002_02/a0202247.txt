Abstract    :
              Under the leadership of St. Louis Community College at Florissant Valley
              (SLCC-FV), the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR), and the St. Louis Area
              Tech-Prep Consortium of 28 school districts partner for this project. The
              project focuses on the development of a 3-D Solid Modeling (Unigraphics)
              course, professional development for secondary school teachers, student
              enrichment and outreach activities for high school students, and adaptation and
              implementation of South Carolina ATE Gateway to Technology program.

Through
              the legislative and former governor's leadership and financial support from the
              state of Missouri, St. Louis Community College at Florissant Valley has already
              been involved in an extensive upgrade of its facilities and programs. In the
              last three years the state of Missouri has awarded over $1.5 million to the
              college to enhance its laboratory facilities for manufacturing related
              programs, and has appropriated $2.1 million to expand the physical facilities.
              Scope of the project includes developing one course at the associate's level in
              a manufacturing related topic, organizing workshops and training sessions in
              manufacturing related topics for high school teachers and students, and
              implementing Gateway to Technology (developmental) program to improve
              preparedness of SLCC-FV students for engineering and engineering technology
              programs.
