Abstract    :
              The investigators will use line-of-sight (LOS) velocity drift measurements from
              the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) to characterize the
              statistical nature of velocity variability in the high latitude ionosphere. 
              They will use the existing SuperDARN dataset to determine the temporal
              variability in LOS measurements on 100X45 km spatial scales and 1 minute time
              scales over the entire high latitude ionosphere.  It has been shown that
              variability in the convection electric field is a significant factor in
              determining the amount of Joule heating in this region.  General circulation
              models of the thermosphere use statistical or averaged convection electric
              fields which contain no information about the small-scale variability and thus
              seriously underestimate the amount of Joule heating.  The wide coverage of the
              SuperDARN radars will allow determination of the relationships between velocity
              variability and magnetospheric features.  The resulting comprehensive
              characterizations of the electric field variability will facilitate more
              realistic inputs to global models and better understanding of the
              magnetosphere-ionosphere system.
