Abstract    :
              Summary:  This proposal requests funding for an exploratory field effort to test
              the feasibility of acquiring long multi-decadal to multi-century coral time
              series from subaerially exposed reefs in the western Pacific warm pool.  Large
              coral heads from raised terraces in the Western Solomon Islands will be cored. 
              A limited set of x-ray analyses, U-series dating, and isotopic measurements
              will be done to test the suitability of these locations for providing reliable
              multi-decadal to multi-century coral time series records for intervals of the
              Holocene.
