The PIs propose to hold a community workshop
              at Scripps Institute of Oceanography to develop a consensus plan for modern
              paleo, rock and geomagnetic databases.  As discussed in detail in the proposal,
              the conference is being held to bring together an interdisciplinary group of
              experts to discuss how to bring technological advances in IT to develop
              web-based handling for magnetic data.  The community will be considering how to
              integrate with other developing IT database activities in the geosciences,
              including the international community.  Funds will be used to cover travel and
              accommodations of key participants from the different sub-disciplines involved
              in magnetism research.  It is expected that a broad and interdisciplinary
              cross-section of researchers from academia, government labs, and the broad
              international community will participate in the conference.
