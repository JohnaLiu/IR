Natural patterns
              turn up all over the place.  One sees them on windswept sand dunes, as ripples
              on long sandy beaches, on plant skins and animal coats, as fingerprints, on
              optical beams, in cloud formations.  The striking similarities between the
              textures of patterns and their defects which arise in diverse microscopic
              situations lead one to the conclusion that patterns are macroscopic objects
              whose behaviors are well described almost everywhere by universal equations
              that reflect overall symmetry properties shared by the individual systems.  For
              example, the triradius defect on each human fingertip is also seen on optical
              beams and in magnetic materials. The reason is not that there is any
              fundamental connection between light and the fetal epidermis but rather that in
              both contexts the system under stress is two dimensional with translational and
              rotational invariance.  The equations describing the overall pattern will be
              the same.  The central goal of this research is to develop a global description
              of such stationary patterns far from onset.  Up to now, certain individual
              parts of the textures were well understood, but there was no theory, for
              example, to say what the total convection pattern would be in an elliptical
              container whose side walls were heated.

This research project will
              investigate the common mathematical structure that underlies the diverse
              occurrence of patterns in nature.  The work will contribute to the
              understanding and prediction of important physical phenomena.
