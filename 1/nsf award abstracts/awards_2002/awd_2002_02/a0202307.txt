Abstract    :
              The Community Colleges of Colorado plan to establish a regional center in
              information technology (IT) to significantly increase the supply, capability
              and diversity of the IT workforce in Colorado. The Center is a consortium of
              the community colleges with the Colorado Institute of Technology, the National
              Workforce Center for Emerging Technologies and a proposed Colorado IT Industry
              Advisory Council. A technology symposium is held to engage industry and
              colleges in a dialogue about key issues. Industry needs to become aware of the
              roles for two-year college graduates in IT. The IT curricula in two-year
              colleges need to be upgraded and expanded based upon standards and industry
              requirements. The faculty, teachers, counselors and administrators need ongoing
              professional development. Students need to be provided consistent information
              and advising about IT positions. This symposium serves to develop the basis for
              the Center.
