Abstract    :
              As noted in the proposal, optical networking actually encompasses a range of
              technologies which are under continuous improvement.  Many universities and
              research organizations are currently interested in deploying a subset of these
              technologies using various strategies to enhance research and learning.

This
              proposal is for SURA to facilitate a workshop that 
explores the current state
              of optical technologies,
assists in educating campus networking professionals
              about optical technologies,
explores current best practices involving the
              deployment of optical technologies in support of advanced academic networks at
              the local, regional and national level.

This will be a 2-day meeting in
              North Carolina, December 13-14, 2001. The long-term outcome of the conference
              is expected to be an Optical Networking Cookbook.
