Abstract    :
              This award provides continued funding of The Nyanza Project, a Research
              Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site on the shore of Lake Tanganyika,
              Africa offering interdisciplinary research and training in paleoclimatology,
              atmospheric science, limnology, and biology for undergraduates, graduate
              students and secondary school teachers interested in tropical lake studies. 
              The award provides support for administrative staff, academic mentors, and
              equipment at the site and allows for the participation American undergraduate
              students, graduate students, and secondary school teachers in the field. 
              American students and mentors join their African counterparts for an
              interactive season of teaching and research at the field site.

This REU
              award weaves science, education, and cultural exchange into a rich tapestry. 
              As such, it has the potential for opening doors for educational opportunity
              while it opens minds to a greater understanding of natural science.  The Nyanza
              Project also promotes capacity building and technology transfer between
              American and African students and colleagues.  In general, the Nyanza Project
              offers a unique educational and cultural opportunity to young scientists
              interested in the natural sciences.
