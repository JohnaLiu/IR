Challenges in Ecological Science and the National Ecological
              Observatory Network 

The Ecological Society of America proposes two
              activities that explore the connections between current ecological science and
              the opportunities afforded by NEON.  One component of the proposed work is the
              development of a technical paper that describes current ecological challenges
              and how they might be met by a program such as NEON. The paper will also
              highlight elements that will be useful in planning the new network. The second
              element is the development of a CD that visually and concisely encapsulates the
              objectives of the NEON program. These objectives will be attained through a
              series of workshops sponsored by the ESA.
