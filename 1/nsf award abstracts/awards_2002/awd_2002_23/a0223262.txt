Abstract    :
              This US-Hungarian collaborative project between Lajos Horvath and Piotr Kokoszka
              of the University of Utah and their Hungarian partners, Istvan Berkes and Endre
              Csaki of the A. Renyi Institute of Mathematics in Budapest, examines several
              statistical and probabilistic problems concerned with the detection and
              analysis of nonstationarities of various types of stochastic processes.
              Emphasis is on careful analysis of the rates of convergence of the statistics
              of interest and on the properties of the associated permutation and bootstrap
              procedures.  Junior researchers from the University of Utah also
              participate.

The joint research plan includes an investigation of change
              point procedures and the properties of unit root tests, that are to be
              developed based on resampling and subsampling methods.  These are fundamental
              questions associated with the detection of time series.  Results may have
              practical applications in economics and the financial sector by leading to
              useful derivations of properties of CUSUM procedures and GARCH models.  For
              example, findings may improve models for stock returns that can be refined to
              accommodate infinite error variance. 

This statistics research project
              fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
              experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary
              talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
              competence.
