Abstract    :
              The long range goal of this project is to develop an integrated biological and
              computational approach to decipher gene regulatory networks.  This project
              combines discovery-based approaches to identify and characterize new regulatory
              networks with hypothesis-driven approaches in which transcriptional control by
              two regulatory factors important in galactose metabolism will be examined.  The
              specific aims of this project are: (1) to temporally profile the global genetic
              and proteomic response to galactose; (2) to globally identify the elements of
              transcriptional networks important for galactose utilization; (3) to develop an
              advanced computational framework for integration, modeling, and prediction of
              transcriptional networks; and (4) to experimentally test the networks models
              predicted from these studies.
