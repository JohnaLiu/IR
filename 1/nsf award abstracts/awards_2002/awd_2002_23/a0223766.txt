Abstract    :
              Recent advances in telecommunications, materials nanotechnology and biology have
              potential implications in the area of control.  The purpose of this workshop is
              to define the generic methodological research needs pursuant to these advances
              as: (1) they will involve a more detailed description of nature, down to the
              cellular and molecular level, and (2) the next set of engineering systems will
              be of a larger size and their complexity will be far greater than in the past. 
              

This grant is for support of a multidisciplinary workshop that will address
              the research needs in the areas of Modeling, Dynamics, Control and Monitoring
              of Complex Engineering Systems.  It will take place in Anchorage Alaska on May
              11 and 12 following the American Control Conference.  By scheduling it to
              follow immediately after the ACC, the cost will be substantially lower since
              most of the participants will already be on site and the meeting rooms on
              Saturday will be free.  The organization of the workshop aims to avoid the
              segregation of issues and challenges along the traditional Engineering
              disciplines.  A systematic effort will be undertaken to consider issues that
              are common to all engineering fields and breakout sessions will have
              participants that cover all engineering disciplines.
