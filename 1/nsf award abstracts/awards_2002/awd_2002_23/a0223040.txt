University of Hawaii - Hilo (UHH) will significantly increase
              enrollment and graduation rates of Native Hawaiian students in mathematics and
              science disciplines and increase their familiarity with and the use of related
              technology.  Elements of the project will take advantage of the extraordinary
              natural and cultural environment in which the University is situated.

UHH
              will implement a new model for STEM education that is predicated on the
              integration of assets of culture and natural environment, and which recognizes
              the importance of early (K- 12 years) and positive exposure if increasing
              percentages of students are to be attracted to STEM disciplines.  The model,
              called Hawaiian Compass for Advancement in Science and Technology,
involves
              the advancement of faculty development which enculturates Hawaiian values, ways
              of knowing and learning, and use of current technology, curricula enhancement
              (technological and pedagogical) in STEM disciplines, faculty research, and
              outreach to Hawaiian students and communities through special enrichment
              classes and informational programs.
