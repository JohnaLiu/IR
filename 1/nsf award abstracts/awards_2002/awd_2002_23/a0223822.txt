Abstract    :
              The abundance of water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere is
              an important determinant of the chemical and climatic state of the earth's
              atmosphere.  The ability to predict water vapor at these high altitudes remains
              one of the most important challenges in general circulation models.  The PI
              will investigate this using the National Center for Atmosphere Research (NCAR)
              Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM).  He will introduce two stable
              isotopes of water, HDO and H218O, and the associated physics, into the model. 
              In addition, medium-lived tracers, such as ozone and carbon monoxide, that do
              not condense will be analyzed.  The research will be focused in the "tropical
              tropopause layer", a transition region between the troposphere and the
              stratosphere.  Model integrations for several years will be compared with
              measurements using traces such as ozone, carbon monoxide, and the isotopes of
              water.  The results should provide new understanding of the pathways by which
              air reaches the stratosphere and of the mechanisms that control the
              stratospheric water vapor concentration. 

The research work will be done in
              collaborating with the WACCM team at NCAR.  The isotopic modules developed will
              be made available to the general community and, possibly, be included in the
              standard version of the WACCM.  The research will also provide good
              opportunities for graduate studies.
