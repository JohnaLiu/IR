Abstract    :
              Systemic Research, Inc. will collaborate with the awardee institutions of NSF's
              Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) in the development and
              implementation of a Self Assessment and Evaluation System. Within the context
              of TCUP goals and relevant Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA)
              requirements, the TCUP Self Evaluation System will assist TCUP awardee
              institutions with progress indicator data collection for formative
              self-assessment and evaluation. Electronic evaluation instruments will be
              designed and developed in close coordination with TCUP awardee institutions to
              collect relevant quantitative and qualitative indicator data.  

This
              activity will enhance TCUP awardee institutions' capacity to monitor and assess
              institutional efforts to broaden participation in science, technology,
              engineering and mathematics disciplines. Proposed collaborative efforts will
              enhance institutional database management, evaluation and research capacity at
              TCUP awardee institutions.
