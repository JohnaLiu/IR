Partial support is provided for a one-week materials camp for
              30 high school students, to be held at the University of Washington.  Projects
              will include hands-on experiments in materials characterization, materials
              processing, and analysis of the failure of components.  The camp is for high
              school juniors from across the US and is taught by mentors who are volunteer
              professionals.  The camp concludes with presentations of each group of the
              results of a team project.
