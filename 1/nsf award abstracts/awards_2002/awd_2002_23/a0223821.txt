Abstract    :
              The objective of this research project is to develop a post-processing technique
              to planarize curved freestanding thin film microelectromechanical systems
              (MEMS) devices by means of controlled exposure to a neutral ion beam. The
              method works by (1) affecting a thin highly stressed layer in the first few
              seconds of ion beam exposure through atomic rearrangement near the surface of
              the film; and, (2) removing initially stressed material in the film after
              several additional minutes of ion beam exposure.  These effects can be combined
              in a controlled way to offset the initial relaxation curvature in the
              micro-mirror.  MEMS micro-mirrors are important components in several
              next-generation optical communications devices.  Freestanding MEMS
              micro-mirrors are often fabricated in a layer-by-layer process before being
              released from a host substrate; through-thickness dimensions may be as small as
              one micron or less. Once these thin structures are released, residual stresses
              due to processing are relaxed by transverse curvatures large enough to render
              the devices optically useless. 

The program includes both theoretical and
              experimental work.  Using analytical and numerical models, the effects of
              various processing parameters will be studied; experiments will be carried out
              to test these parameters, and the quality of the resulting planarized mirrors
              will be characterized.
