Abstract    :
              9731607  Pollock      This cooperative research project between Professor John 
              Pollock, Department of Biological Sciences, Carnegie-Mellon  University, and
              Professor Philip Batterham, Department of  Genetics, University of Melbourne, 
              focuses on the molecular  genetic analysis of normal and mutant visual system 
              development of Drosophila melanogaster.  The U.S. and  Australian researchers
              and their laboratories bring  complementary expertise to this study: image
              analysis and  tissue culture in Pollock's laboratory, and molecular and 
              genetic expertise in Batterham's laboratory.  The research  plan involves a
              multifaceted attack on the role of played by  the lozenge locus in the
              progressive recruitment and  differentiation of cells in the developing eye. 
              This  research should provide further understanding of  how eyes  develop and
              also how lozenge influences the development of  smell and taste.  It will also
              provide a platform for the  training of young researchers in an international
              setting.
