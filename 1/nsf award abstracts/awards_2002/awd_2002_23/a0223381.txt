Abstract    :
              This project examines the seasonal variation in the nature of the organic carbon
              deposited on continental margins. The flux of organic carbon reaching the
              seabed can be quantified by using particle traps or by modeling seabed burial
              and regeneration rates, but the quality (i.e., its lability) has been difficult
              to assess on continental margins because of co-deposition with old refractory
              carbon from marine and terrestrial systems. Bomb Carbon-14 (C14) is a useful
              tracer of recently produced marine organic matter, but this signal is masked in
              continental margin particle?trap samples and surface sediments by the older and
              refractory carbon that is re-suspended and reworked from shallower marine
              deposits. Surface deposit feeders in continental margin systems have been shown
              to sequester the labile fraction of the total organic flux reaching the seabed
              as a result of their selective ingestive and digestive processes. Therefore,
              the body tissues and the gut sediments of these benthic fauna can provide a
              record of the labile material reaching the continental margin seafloor.
              

Initial C14 data indicate that the body tissues of surface depositing
              feeders are enriched in this radioisotope by 100 to 300 per mil relative to the
              surface sediments in which they live and feed. Based on mass?balance C14
              calculations, the labile component may comprise only a few tenths of a percent
              of the total organic matter in the surface seabed, yet the surface deposit
              feeders exhibit C14 signatures in their body tissues (+20 to +80 per mil)
              dominated by the local bomb?produced signal . Thorium (Th) data from
              continental margins suggest that as much as 50% of the recently deposited
              organic matter on the continental margin sea floor may pass through the guts of
              deposit feeders prior to microbial degradation or burial. Therefore, C14
              measurements on benthic fauna can provide a unique tool for assessing the
              lability of organic matter reaching the seafloor and for tracking the fate of
              this material in the benthic food web. Many existing diagenetic models treat
              organic matter regeneration by microbes and deposit feeders as a batch process
              with a single carbon degradation constant for the bulk organic matter. The C14
              data clearly show that ingestion of organic matter and digestion of this
              material are very selective processes. The C14 analyses from the California
              Borderland and the Antarctic continental margin have shown the utility of this
              approach for documenting variations in the organic carbon lability of surface
              sediments.

Drs. DeMaster and Smith will expand the initial studies to enable
              assessment of seasonal variations in the quality of organic carbon deposited on
              the seabed. Particle?trap samples, benthic?faunal tissues, gut samples and
              surface sediments have been collected during 6 cruises to the California
              Borderland and 5 cruises to the Antarctic continental margin covering the major
              seasonal variations in organic carbon supply. Funds are requested for making
              150 C14 analyses (and complementary C13, N15, and C/N measurements) on these
              samples so that a time series quantifying the nature and flux of organic matter
              reaching the seabed can be determined. They will assess not only seasonal
              variations in the nature of particle selection and digestive selection
              processes for organic matter, but also the changes in these processes as a
              result of feeding strategy (epibenthic surface deposit feeders, vs. subsurface
              deposit feeders vs. head?down subsurface deposit feeders) on the seafloor.
