The Principal Investigator will undertake core-top
              calibration studies to improve the applicability, accuracy, and precision of
              ostracode magnesium/calcium (Mg/Ca) paleothermometry to reconstruct the late
              Quaternary temperature history of the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas. The
              existing core-top calibration is limited to adult shells of one genus, Krithe,
              and includes sediment core tops that are not likely to be of modern age. These
              factors, along with variations in the spatial and temporal abundance of adult
              shells of Krithe in the Arctic, contribute to diminish the accuracy, precision
              (1 to 20C, depending on number of shells available), and applicability of
              ostracode paleothermometry in the Arctic Ocean.  However, studies suggest that
              the adult shells of other common Arctic genera may also be used for Mg/Ca
              paleothermometry, and, furthermore, that eldest juvenile shells display
              thermodependent uptake of magnesium identical to that of adult shells. If so,
              the combination of juvenile/adult calibrations and calibrations from multiple
              genera may provide the improvements necessary to more accurately and precisely
              quantify the temperature history of the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas.  To
              test this hypothesis, modern adult and juvenile shells of common Arctic genera
              Krithe and Cytheropteron will be analyzed from an extensive collection of
              existing, high-quality sediment core tops (box cores and multicores) from
              Arctic, Atlantic, and Pacific ocean basins at water temperatures ranging from
              -1 to 120C. A subset of these core tops have been used for benthic foraminifer
              Mg/Ca calibration studies.  The research will provide for the first
              comprehensive calibration-comparison of the two most promising deep-sea
              paleothermometers available for paleoceanographic and paleoclimate studies.
