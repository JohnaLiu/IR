This is a 36 month project submitted by Dr. Sheldon
              Stone, Syracuse University, to cooperate with Professor CHEN Ting-Yang, Nanjing
              University, and Professors HE Mao and FENG CunFeng, Shangdong University,
              China, to carry out a U.S.-China cooperative project on BteV calorimetry.  This
              is an excellent proposal for understanding the use of lead tungstate crystals
              for applications in calorimetry, and can contribute to the research and
              training interactions between high-energy physics groups in the U.S. and China.
              This proposal addresses an important scientific question and contributes to the
              NSF goals of human resource development.  The National Science Foundation of
              China and NSF will jointly support this project.
