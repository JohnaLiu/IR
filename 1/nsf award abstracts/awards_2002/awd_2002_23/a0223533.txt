This award provides partial support for
              mathematicians from
underrepresented groups and other junior mathematicians
              without 
other means of support to attend a Geometry and Topology
              Conference
on May 3,4, and 5 at Harvard University.  The first day of the
              
conference will emphasize Karen Uhlenbeck's leading role in 
mentoring women
              in Mathematics and feature four female speakers
from a well known leader in
              the field to other more junior 
mathematicians.  There will be several poster
              session during the
conference including one on "Women in Science."  The second
              and 
third days of the conference will feature lectures from twelve 
eminent
              Geometers and Topologists.  Further details about the conference, including
              lists of speakers and local hotels can 
be found at
