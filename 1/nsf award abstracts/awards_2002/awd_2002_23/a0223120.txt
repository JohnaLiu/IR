Abstract    :
              The proposal is for an experimental and analytical investigation to improve the
              understanding of evaporation mechanisms and the effects of individual forces on
              fluid flow and heat transfer in thin films under high heat flux conditions. 
              The PI will develop an analytical model for thin film evaporation that includes
              thermocapillary force, surface tension, friction, wetting, and disjoining
              pressure.  He will also develop an experimental system to measure film
              thickness, interface velocity and film profile under high heat flux conditions.
               The effects of electrostatic fields on the disjoining pressure and the effects
              of surface microstructures on the thin film evaporation will also be addressed.
               The results would help advance applications in a variety of emerging
              technologies in which microchannel evaporative flows occur.
