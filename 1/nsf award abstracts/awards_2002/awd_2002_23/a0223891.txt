Abstract    :
              For this MUSES planning activity, the University of Washington, in collaboration
              with Sichuan University in Chengdu, China, will undertake a set of workshops to
              generate a coordinated, binational plan for research and education in the area
              of the interaction of materials processing and use with the environment in our
              regions.  The project will build teams on both sides, which on the faculty
              level, incorporate expertise in materials science, design for the environment,
              computational approaches to environmental modeling, and economics and social
              science.  Significant roles for undergraduate and graduate students in the
              research and educational planning process are incorporated in the program
              design.

The program will support two planning workshops, one in Seattle and
              one in Chengdu, in which the binational teams will come together to more fully
              develop the research and educational agenda.  There are three main foci for the
              collaboration 1) Design of comprehensive regional industrial ecology models for
              the effect of the materials processing industry on the environment.  The
              regions of focus for this study are the Puget Sound Region and the Sichuan
              basin 2) Creation of a collaborative plan for research on materials for fuel
              cells, with a particular focus on the transportation sector, and; 3)
              Collaboration on the more effective incorporation of environmental issues in
              materials science curriculum.

As a concrete result of the workshops,
              detailed plans for ongoing partnerships will be generated which can be
              incorporated in proposals for more comprehensive funding to national research
              organizations in both countries, to private foundations, and to the industrial
              sector
