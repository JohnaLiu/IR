Abstract    :
              The NSF Workshop on Learning and Approximate Dynamic Programming is proposed to
              take place on April 8-10, 2002, in Playacar, Mexico. The technical focus of the
              workshop is to address one common cross-cutting problem: how do we do our best,
              using learning-based approaches or the equivalent, to develop general-purpose
              designs to try to maximize the sum of expected utility over future time, in a
              nonlinear stochastic environment, without just simulating the entire
              future?

An important goal of the workshop is to bring people in diverse
              areas to unify their efforts to tackle some important problems. The workshop is
              therefore highly interdisciplinary, and the invitees are world leaders in
              machine learning, control systems theory, and neural networks. The technical
              program is intended to create opportunities for participants to carry on
              discussions and to form teams for their future work.
