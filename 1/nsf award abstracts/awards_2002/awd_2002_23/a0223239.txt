Abstract    :
              The PIs will obtain and interpret cave speleothem 14C/12C records and
              high-resolution climate records from the same samples from Crevice Cave,
              Missouri and Hulu Cave, Nanjing, China. The records will be dated independently
              and precisely with high precision 230Th and 231Pa techniques enabling
              determination of initial 14C/12C values and establishment of an absolute
              chronology. The PIs will use the records to (1) reconstruct atmospheric 14C/12C
              for the whole radiocarbon timescale (the last 45 ky) and (2) compare those
              records directly to the climate records from the same samples. The former will
              place constraints on the operation of the ocean-atmosphere carbon cycle since
              glacial times. The latter will characterize the interplay between changes in
              the carbon cycle and climate change. Both have implications for the
              understanding of the current and future carbon cycle. Recent work indicates
              extremely high and variable atmospheric 14C/12C for much of the interval
              between 44 and 34 Ka. The radiocarbon values are generally well above values
              that can be achieved with the modern carbon cycle, even if terrestrial and
              solar magnetic fields were negligible. These data therefore require significant
              differences between  the modern and glacial carbon cycles, as well as large
              temporal changes in the glacial carbon cycle. The far-reaching implications of
              this work require replication, ideally at sites other than the Bahamas, the
              site where this evidence was collected.
