Certain environmental signals and cues, such as background
              color and day length, are capable of altering the appearance (phenotype) of the
              pupae of swallowtail butterflies. The ability to respond to environmental
              signals is known as a conditional strategy.  This research proposal offers a
              means to investigate the underlying biochemical and genetic mechanisms
              responsible for this conditional strategy.  The research team will use methods
              from chemistry, molecular and cellular biology, mathematics, computer science
              and population genetics. Some of these methods include protein isolation, DNA
              sequencing, immunology and histology, computational biology and theoretical
              population genetics.

Conditional strategies are now regarded as an important
              but poorly understood mechanism for adapting to changing environments.  Such
              traits are especially common in important pest species, such as insects, and
              may be a key factor in the ability of insects to survive and reproduce in
              changing climates and agricultural conditions.  Therefore the research will
              provide important insights into fundamental biological processes of potential
              economic importance. In addition, the proposed research is highly
              interdisciplinary, and will introduce several dozen undergraduate science
              majors to state-of-the-art research methods in the context of modern biological
              theory.
