Abstract    :
              The project defines a workflow management system that allows for a  portal
              construction that is fully integrated with emerging gird standards (e.g.,
              Globus Toolkit), but can be dynamically reconfigured..  By defining an XML
              schema to describe both resources and application codes and interfaces, the
              project will enable a pluggable event-driven model where grid-enabled services
              can be composed to form more elaborate pipelines of information processing,
              simulation, and visual analysis.  The workflow management system will be
              developed in close collaboration with computational chemists to not only
              provide proof-of-concept, but also to insure that the complete system is
              immediately useful to an established scientific community. The proposal is
              designed by chemists and grid/portal technology specialists to work together to
              form a usable system.  The technology/science mix is essential as it ensures
              the success of grid-based projects in that it dramatically improves the utility
              for the end-user. 

The proposal also works closely with chemists and portal
              specialists to ensure a truly usable system.   The resulting architecture will
              shield users from the complexity of the HPC resources, and allows them to focus
              on their scientific problem.  The goal is to enable scientific programmers the
              ability to integrate their software into the workflow system in a simple,
              effective and uniform manner.
