Abstract    :
              The 2002 annual meeting of the Phytochemical Society of North America will bring
              together (for the first time) chemical ecologists, biochemists, natural
              products chemists, molecular biologists, biomedical researchers and
              ethnobotanists/pharmacologists with the goal of developing an integrative
              synthesis of these traditional and modern approaches.  Symposia will address
              ways in which these subdisciplines can inform each other about the evolution,
              function, and potential applications of plant products.  Submitted
              presentations also will address the meeting theme, "Integrative Phytochemistry:
              From Ethnobotany to Molecular Ecology".  This meeting will provide an
              unprecedented intersection of biology, chemistry, sociology and medecine and
              should produce truly novel, international and cross-cultural collaborative
              opportunities. 
	The meeting will be held in Merida, Mexico; attendees will
              come from all over North America and Europe (at least), and strong
              representation by Mexican and other Latin American scientists and students is
              expected.  Meeting organizers highlight participation by students and younger
              scientists by organizing a 'young researcher' symposium and seeking support for
              travel by students, postdocs, and junior researchers.  Proceedings will be
              published as a volume in the widely-read "Recent Advances in Phytochemistry"
              series.
