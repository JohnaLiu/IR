Title: Physics and
              Remote Sensing of Convective Storms

This grant supports research on the
              microphysics and kinematics of tropical convective storms using archival data
              from NASA TRMM experiments in Brazil, Florida, and Kwajalein.  The data consist
              of Doppler spectra measured by UHF profiler, polarimetric radar data, and
              supporting airborne and surface-based meteorological observations.  Special
              attention is given to the relation between the updraft profile in the cloud and
              the drop-size distributions that evolve through different growth processes.  
              Key questions center on the existence and significance of equilibrium drop-size
              distributions, established when collision-induced drop breakup is balanced by
              drop growth, and the interpretation of the so-called balance level where the
              mean Doppler velocity for vertical viewing is zero.  Comparisons will be made
              between the drop-size distribution measured by profiler and the polarimetric
              radar measurements.  One goal of the study is to improve the ability to measure
              rainfall rate by radar.  Another is to advance precipitation physics by
              synthesizing the data from a unique combination of observing instruments.
