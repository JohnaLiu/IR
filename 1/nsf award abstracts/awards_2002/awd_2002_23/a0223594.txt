The American Association for the Advancement of
              Science (AAAS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) will continue the
              AAAS/NSF Fellowship Program for a third year.  Up to seven Fellows for the
              2002-2003 year will be selected and placed in offices throughout NSF, working
              on projects of mutual interest to the Fellows and the host directorate or
              office. Fellows will learn how NSF funds science, while providing scientific,
              engineering and educational input on issues relating to NSF's mission support
              of fundamental science and engineering research and education. 
 
Fellows
              will work with staff involved in planning, development and oversight of agency
              programs in all fields of fundamental research. Assignments may involve
              significant interagency, congressional or international activity, as well as
              involvement with the National Science Board, NSF's policy-setting body. The
              program includes an orientation on executive branch and congressional
              operations, as well as a yearlong seminar program on issues involving science,
              technology and public policy.
