Abstract    :
              A workshop would be organized and held at Princeton to celebrate the
              introduction of quasiconvexity by C.B. Morrey 50 years earlier by surveying
              recent developments and stimulating future applications. Quasiconvixity was
              originally introduced as a condition to understand the closely related
              questions of lower semicontinuity and existence in the calculus of variations.
              It is now clear that quasiconvexity is fundamental in many other applications.
