Abstract    :
              Black carbon (BC), the product of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and
              biomass, has been increasingly formed and released to the environment for the
              last century. Presently, it is not possible to quantify (a) the rate of BC
              burial in the oceanic margin sediments (where most of the OC is buried), (b)
              the size of the BC reservoir in seawater, nor (c) riverine fluxes of BC to the
              sea. Consequently, it is not possible to ascertain how important BC is to the
              global carbon cycle. Under this award, the PIs address the following questions:
              (1)What is the contribution of BC burial relative to the organic carbon burial
              in the Gulf of Maine? (2) How has the input flux of BC to the region's bed
              sediments changed in the past century? (3) What is the inventory of BC in
              coastal seawater off the Northeast United States and what temporal and spatial
              variability does this reservoir exhibit? (4) What are riverine inputs of BC to
              the Gulf of Maine and how do they vary seasonally? (5) Can we identify the
              major sources of BC (e.g., fossil fuel combustion-produced soots,
              biomass-derived chars) for coastal seawater and sediment of the Gulf of Maine?
              In addition to measurement of the abundance of BC in various samples, the
              approach taken includes field sampling of water and sediments, and a variety of
              analytical measurements including: 234Th/238U disequilibria in water and
              unsupported 210Pb in sediments, carbon isotopes in BC and specific compounds as
              well as with key marker compounds (PAHs), and  BC analyses in radiometrically
              dated sediment cores collected from within and beyond the Gulf of Maine.
