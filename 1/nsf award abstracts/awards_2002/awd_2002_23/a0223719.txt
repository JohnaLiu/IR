Abstract    :
              Sequence motifs in genomes are one of the ways genes are regulated in a
              coordinate fashion. The simple occurrence and correlation of sequences with
              specific function is supportive of the hypothesis that a given distribution is
              involved in regulation.  The ability to identify motifs both by sequence and
              location, as well as to indicate a likelihood score will enable the generation
              of a series of possible regulatory motifs in both Arabidopsis and E. elegans.
              Introns as well as upstream regions will be examined. Genes with similar
              sequences will be clustered and the analysis compared with microarray data to
              determine possible biological significance. A similar approach could be
              extended from DNA sequence to short amino acid motifs to help cluster the
              proteome of each organism.
