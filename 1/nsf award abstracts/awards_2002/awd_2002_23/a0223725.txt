Abstract    :
              This award provides partial funding for the 2002 Polymers Physics Gordon
              Research Conference representing of the research in the field.  The invited
              speakers are world leaders, and the tradition of the conference is that it s
              well attended by young scientists with potential to be the future leaders of
              polymer physics.  The organizers great will engage graduate students, and young
              postdoctoral researchers in the discussions of the conference.

The
              conference will consist of nine sessions with a total of 22 oral presentations,
              and two poster sessions.  Invited speakers have been selected on the basis of
              their relevant expertise while emphasizing a program with gender balance and
              participation of young investigators that show promise as future scientific
              leaders.
