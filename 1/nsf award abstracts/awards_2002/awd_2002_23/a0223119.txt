Abstract    :
              Under this funding, the PI will attempt to determine the role of organic matter
              compositions in controlling carbon sequestration and turnover by quantitatively
              investigating how different organic carbon (OC) fractions are cycled within a
              well-characterized sediment system: the Atchafalaya River/Louisiana Shelf.
              Specifically, the study will trace the changes in concentration and composition
              of four major OC pools of contrasting origin, particle characteristics (e.g.
              density), and reactivity: (i) vascular plant debris, (ii) soil organic matter,
              (iii) ancient fossil kerogen, and (iv) marine organic matter remains. The
              objectives of the work are to determine the distribution of the four OC pools
              within the Atchafalaya River/Louisiana Shelf dispersal system, to follow the
              concentration changes and compositional transformations of these OC pools along
              the dispersal system, and to determine the sequestration rates and
              compositional changes of the four OC pools during burial in the Louisiana
              shelf. The study consists of field sampling followed by lab studies to
              determine: (a) density fractionation of sediments, (b) elemental (carbon,
              nitrogen) compositions, (c) stable carbon and radiocarbon isotopic
              compositions, (d) 13C-NMR characterization of organic isolates, and (e)
              biomarker concentrations and isotopic signatures.
