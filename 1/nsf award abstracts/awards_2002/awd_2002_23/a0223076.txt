With National Science Foundation support, the
              Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network will continue to provide
              technical assistance in the Foundation's Historically Black Colleges and
              Universities (HBCU-UP) Program. The goal of the HBCU-UP Program is to
              strengthen the Nation's workforce by enhancing the quality of undergraduate
              Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology
(SMET) programs at HBCUs.
              Support from the Foundation will enable the QEM Network to:
(1) Conduct four
              proposal development workshops (two per year), prior to the HBCU-UP Program's
              annual deadline, for faculty at eligible institutions to improve the quality of
              multi-year and planning grant proposals submitted to the Foundation's HBCU-UP
              Program;
(2) Conduct a follow-up workshop for institutions submitting
              proposals in the annual competition, whether or not their proposals were
              successful, to discuss next steps;
(3) Conduct a workshop for new grantees
              focused on performance indicators, data collection, assessment, and annual
              reporting requirements as well as assist grantee institutions in developing an
              internal capacity for monitoring, assessing, and assisting in both the internal
              and external evaluation of their respective projects;
(4) Provide on-site
              technical assistance to multi-year HBCU-UP award recipients linked to critical
              needs identified during implementation of their respective HBCU-UP
              Projects;
(5) Create and maintain at QEM's Website links to potential sources
              of federal and non-federal support to assist grantee institutions in sustaining
              and institutionalizing the successful elements of their HBCU-UP projects as
              HBCU-UP funding ends as well as a listserv for HBCU-UP Project Directors.
