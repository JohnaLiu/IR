              ABSTRACT

OCE-0223200

Recent discoveries have shown that photoxidation of
              colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) also lead to the formation of dissolved
              inorganic carbon (DIC) or photo-CO2.  Fluxes of photo-CO2 are estimated to
              produce one to several gigatons of CO2-C per year globally.  A PI from Woods
              Hole Oceanographic Institution proposes to constrain photo-CO2 production using
              the Pool Isotopic Exchange (PIE) method, a technique which does not require
              perturbing the sample as occurs in currently available methods (i.e., changing
              pH, removing carbonate system, bubbling of sample).  In the PIE method, the
              DI12C pool in seawater is replaced via exchange with DI13CO2 during incubation
              of the samples; thus, the DI12C pool which dilutes the newly formed 12CO2
              (DI12C) from dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is minimized without major
              perturbations of the physical and chemical properties of the sample.  The rates
              of formation of DI12C as a result of photoxidation will be measured by isotope
              ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS).  The objectives of the proposal are to develop,
              test and optimize the PIE approach both in the laboratory and in the field.  In
              addition, the PI will apply the PIE method and compare his results with those
              obtained by a collaborator from the State University of New York, Stony Brook
              using the Pool Depletion (PD) technique on the same samples recovered from
              waters enriched in CDOM.  Lastly, the PI plans to resolve any potential
              discrepancies obtained via the PIE and PD methods.
