SGER: Digital Government:  Preliminary Evaluation of Process
              Formulisms for Defining Government Processes

Much of the daily operation of
              government may be thought of as the faithful and precise execution of
              prescribed processes (law, rules, regulation).  This small grant will explore
              the potential for the application of a special purpose computer language
              (LittleJIL) to aid in ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of government
              processes, such as the issuing of licenses.  This preliminary grant will begin
              the building of a partnership between the PI and the Commonwealth of
              Massachusetts in investigating the potential of this novel idea.
