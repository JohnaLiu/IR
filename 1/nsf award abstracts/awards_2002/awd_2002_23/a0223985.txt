Abstract    :
              0223985  Graedel  This MUSES incubation project will convene an expert workshop
              to explore data needs and model formulation approaches for the steel-related
              elements.  Materials budgeting is a technique that, in principal, can provide
              information useful for studies of resource availability, potential
              environmental impacts, and policy options.  Though data for steel are
              relatively accessible, this is not necessarily the case for its common alloying
              metals, a group that includes silicon, vanadium, chromium, manganese, cobalt,
              nickel, molybdenum, and tungsten.  The amounts of steel used are so large that,
              for these alloying elements, their cycles are dominated by their use a
              small-percentage alloying elements.  To understand the interrelationships, and
              to predict the usage and availability of these elements in the future, detailed
              dynamic models that couple resource economics, potential technological
              evolution, and use and recycling strategies will be necessary.
The workshop
              will draw participants from a broad geographic spectrum, and will explore
              available data archives, information networks, and partnerships among academia
              and between academia and industry.  Graduate students will be used a focus
              group reporters, both to ensure a detailed record of the workshop and to expose
              them to a group of participants of international stature.
Following the
              workshop, a scientific programmer, under the guidance of the principal
              investigators, will begin the implementation of the concepts developed at the
              workshop.  The workshop report and the preliminary model construction are
              expected to be the basis for more comprehensive research on iron alloying
              element cycles in the future.
