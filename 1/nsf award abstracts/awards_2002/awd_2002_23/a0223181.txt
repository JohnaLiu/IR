Abstract    :
              This is a proposal from the National Academy of Sciences to assess the
              scientific opportunities proposed be the new underground neutrino detectors
              within the context of current and planned neutrino research capabilities
              throughout the world.  This proposal results from a request from OSTP.  The
              request for OSTP to take this immediate action can be found in the President's
              FY03 Budget.

Funding of this proposal will be carried out from OMA and from
              the Office of Polar Programs.
