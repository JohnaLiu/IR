Abstract    :
              Continental margins are dynamic regions that receive inputs of organic carbon
              derived from both terrestrial and marine sources. Once introduced by the
              Mississippi or fixed on the Louisiana shelf, POC is carried along the shelf,
              decomposed, buried, or transported to deeper regions in the Gulf of Mexico.
              Based on coastal primary production estimates and riverine inputs, only 20-50%
              of the organic carbon in coastal waters off the Mississippi is actually buried
              in Louisiana shelf sediments, and <40% of that buried carbon is of terrestrial
              origin. Thus, the fate of 50-80% of the carbon fraction delivered by the
              Mississippi that cannot be accounted for in shelf sediments remains a key
              question in developing a North American carbon budget. Under this funding, the
              PIs propose a combined approach of compound-specific stable and radiocarbon
              isotopic techniques and biomarker distributions to evaluate fates and transport
              of organic carbon in the Mississippi River delta shelf and slope. The working
              hypothesis of this study is that seasonal changes in the composition and age of
              SOC across the Louisiana shelf/slope are largely determined by pulses in
              terrestrially- and marine-derived organic carbon which occur at distinct time
              periods controlled by changes in Mississippi River discharge and storm energy.
