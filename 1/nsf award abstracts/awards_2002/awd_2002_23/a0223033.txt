Abstract    :
              With NSF support, Little Priest Tribal College (LPTC) will conduct an assessment
              of the institution's science and mathematics curriculum and infrastructure.
              Project activities include evaluations of science and mathematics course
              content, teaching strategies, use of technology for teaching and learning,
              undergraduate and faculty research opportunities, student progress, and S&E
              programming.  An external advisory committee with representation from four-year
              institutions will assist College science and mathematics faculty in the
              development of an institutional plan to strengthen S&E teaching and learning.
              In addition, the College will develop a tracking system to assess the progress
              of the Colleges' science and mathematics graduates that transfer to 4-year
              colleges and universities.
