Abstract    :
              Helioseismic imaging has begun to yield unique diagnostic information about the
              hidden subsurface layers of the Sun.  This effort will pioneer the development
              of a new approach to seismic imaging of the Sun, in which an adaptable physical
              model of the subsurface structure of the solar convection zone plays a
              fundamental part.  This so-called direct modeling approach will be used to
              systematically probe the three-dimensional structure of the turbulent
              convection zone.  Long sequences of SOHO/MDI full-disk Dopplergrams will be
              used to detect turbulent convection as far into the Sun as sensitivity permits.
               The investigation will also assess the comparative advantages of the NSF
              supported GONG+ network.  The focus of this effort will be on
              supergranular-scale flows (30 Mm), which will be characterized statistically in
              terms of velocity correlation functions.
