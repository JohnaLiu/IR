Abstract    :
              The objective of the project is to address several key theoretical issues
              relevant to the frequency-range from 5kHz to 5MHz radio waves observed on the
              ground in the auroral zone, known as auroral roars. With the previous support
              from NSF, the PI and his colleagues were able to provide basic explanations for
              two types of emissions - the continuum roars are generated within the density
              depletion near the F -region source, while the discrete roars are eigenmodes of
              density enhancements. A key ingredient common to both types of emissions are
              the generation of upper-hybrid, or Z -mode waves, and their conversion to
              electromagnetic waves. The previous research project was largely concerned with
              the characterization and understanding of the generation process of
              upper-hybrid/Z -mode waves. The focus of the proposed research will be on the
              conversion and/or coupling of Z -mode waves to electromagnetic waves. Such a
              study is essential to put the theories of continuum and discrete roar emissions
              on a fully viable footing.
