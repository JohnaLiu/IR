Abstract    :
              Professor Catherine Fenselau of the University of Maryland is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary
              Activities for a symposium entitled:  "Analytical Chemistry for Homeland
              Defense and National Security" at the American Chemical Society (ACS) Meeting
              in Boston MA on August 18-22, 2002.  This special symposium is in response to
              the urgent need for analytical chemists to identify basic chemistry research
              required for advances in national security.  Several workshops have been held
              by various government agencies, including the NSF, however, it is useful to
              have open meetings to reach a broad audience, especially young scientists.
