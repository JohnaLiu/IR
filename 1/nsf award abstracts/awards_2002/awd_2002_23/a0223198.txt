Abstract    :
              This research will test the hypothesis that the adsorption of organic carbon
              onto the interlayer surfaces of smectitic clay minerals comprises a significant
              mode of carbon sequestration and preservation in the geologic record.  This
              model provides a unifying theory for organic carbon burial and the formation of
              some black shale deposits in which dissolved organic carbon present in natural
              waters and pore fluids is attracted to charged mineral surfaces of detrital
              clay minerals, and preserved from microbial degradation by physical sheltering.
               Upon burial, mineral surfaces may act to coordinate polymerization of complex
              organic substances such as kerogen and catalyze cracking during catagenesis.
              The proposed research will: 1) determine the geological extent of the
              relationship between interlayer mineral surface area and total organic carbon
              in a range of black shale deposits, economically important source rocks, and
              modern sediments, 2) establish or dismiss the presence of organic matter within
              the smectite interlayer sites of these deposits using X-ray diffraction (XRD)
              techniques and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging
              of crystal edges and determine whether there is amorphous kerogen that is
              mineral associated, and 3) measure the compositional differences of OM
              associated with mineral surfaces versus the total bulk TOC and particulate
              fraction separated using density and centrifugation techniques.
