Description:  This award supports US-India cooperative
              research in quantum statistics.  US physicist Oscar W. Greenberg, University of
              Maryland College Park and Indian collaborator Ashok K. Mishra, Institute of
              Mathematical Sciences, Tharamani will explore the fundamental issues of
              mathematical physics that lie at the heart of quantum mechanics.  In recent
              years, physicists have begun to study and apply "new" forms of statistics that
              are beyond the conventional fermi and bose statistics.  The collaborators will
              study the new statistics with particular regard to their applicability to some
              basic postulates in physics that, due to technological advances, can now be
              tested to high precision through experiment.       

Scope:  This
              collaboration is likely to bring about interesting advances in mathematical
              physics.  It will also initiate a new partnership between the University of
              Maryland and the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, a premier center for
              research in theoretical physics.  India has a tradition of excellence in this
              field that includes S.N. Bose's contributions to particle statistics
              (Bose-Einstein statistics).  At best, this collaboration will enable each
              scientist to bring a distinct cultural perspective to their research on the
              statistics of elementary particles.  This project is supported by the Indian
              Department of Science & Technology (DST)under the NSF/DST joint program.
