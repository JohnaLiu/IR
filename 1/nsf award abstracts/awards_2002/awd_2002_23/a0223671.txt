This project involves research by a cultural anthropologist
              from Princeton University into the recent shift of opinion in American culture
              about the cognitive or emotional lability associated with Attention
              Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHP) and manic-depression.  The project
              investigates the change in popular culture from seeing such lability as a
              defect towards seeing it as a talent that is adaptive in the contemporary
              social and economic environment of intense global competition.  The need for
              rapid and flexible adjustment to changing conditions in the workplace, schools
              and communities may be supporting the more positive views of aspects of
              ADHD-type personalities.  Using historical and ethnographic methods, the
              researcher will investigate these issues in neuroscience research laboratories,
              psychiatric clinics, patient support groups, schools and worker training
              programs, and pharmaceutical corporations.  The research will take place in
              three sites: Orange county, California, Baltimore County, Maryland, and central
              New Jersey to cover a broad range of American society. 
By addressing the
              changing meaning of mental illness and disability in the context of other
              social and cultural processes that are changing, the research will contribute
              to making these highly stigmatized conditions seem more ordinary and
              understandable. This should lead to greater tolerance for people who suffer
              from the illness, as well as greater understanding of how the image of an
              "ideal person" is changing in contemporary American culture.
