Abstract    :
              This award provides support for a cooperative agreement for the operations and
              maintenance of the U.S. National Ice Core Laboratory, hereinafter called "NICL"
              a government-owned facility for storing, curating, and studying ice cores
              recovered from the ice-covered regions of the world. NICL provides NSF- and
              USGS-funded investigators with the capability to conduct examinations and
              measurements of ice cores while preserving the integrity of these cores in a
              safeguarded environment. NICL fosters the utilization of these cores for
              scientific research by handling inquiries from scientists interested in
              obtaining samples of ice cores, by making inventory listings easily available
              through electronic distribution, by acting as an information resource to the
              scientific community and by improving current technologies for ice core
              analysis in accordance with the needs and requirements of their client base.
              NICL is located at the Denver Federal Center in Lakewood, Colorado and is
              housed administratively within the USGS Office of the Central Regional
              Geologist, Geologic Discipline.
