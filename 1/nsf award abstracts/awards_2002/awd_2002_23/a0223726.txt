Abstract    :
              The Midwest Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics Meeting will be held in
              Pittsburgh, PA on May 13-14, 2002.  Although, most of the speakers are faculty,
              this meeting also emphasizes presentations and participation by graduate
              students and postdoctoral scholars working in all areas of thermodynamics,
              including experimental and classical thermodynamics, molecular simulation, and
              statistical mechanics.  Funding is requested to reimburse graduate students for
              travel and registration costs associated with the meeting.  Funds for other
              aspects of running this meeting have been arranged from other sources,
              primarily donations from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of
              Pittsburgh.  NST-CTS has provided student travel funds for this meeting several
              times in the past, and this action has been important in making attendance at
              this meeting widely accessible to graduate students.
