Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, the University of Hawaii Manoa - Maui
              Community College will conduct a comprehensive self-assessment of current and
              planned science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs. The
              assessment includes a review of the existing STEM instructional infrastructure,
              curriculum, faculty professional development opportunities, technology used for
              instruction, high school to college transition programs, community service, and
              Native Hawaiian student retention and success in STEM fields.

Assessment
              outcomes will support the development of a strategic plan to strengthen Maui
              Community College STEM programs to better meet the needs of the community and
              specifically, the Native Hawaiian population.
