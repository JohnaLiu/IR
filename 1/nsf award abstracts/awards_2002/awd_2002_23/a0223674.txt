Abstract    :
              The Olin-Yale-Bayer New Haven Public School Science program of the New Haven
              Public Schools demonstrates an ability to assemble scientists from diverse
              disciplines to work with students and teachers on K-12 science projects. The
              program began six years ago as a partnership among seven schools -- it now
              encompasses more than forty schools in New Haven. It is a comprehensive program
              with multiple components that align goals with outcomes. Students learn the
              scientific method and associated skills by interacting with scientists; the
              scientists train participating teachers. Students are provided with authentic
              research opportunities, where teamwork is promoted and self-esteem is enhanced
              as a result. Older students are able to get academic course credit for their
              work. This program serves a significant number of minority students. As a
              result of program activities, student test scores in science have risen. The
              program has produced a network of mentors that are provided with training and
              support. More than 130 volunteer mentors participated in the 2000-2001 program.
              In the 2001 Connecticut science fair, thirty-four projects were based from this
              program -- those projects involved eleven mentors and forty-eight students (58%
              minority), seven of whom were medallists and ten of whom received special
              awards.
