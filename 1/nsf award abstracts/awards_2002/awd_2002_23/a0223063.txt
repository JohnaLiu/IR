Abstract    :
              Kauai Community College will assess its STEM curriculum, infrastructure, and
              evaluation procedures and determine a course of action to strengthen STEM
              instruction through the integration of curricula and research. Central to this
              effort is a pre-technology project-centered learning community to help address
              barriers that prevent entry of native Hawaiians into STEM-based career
              pathways.

Research activities will serve as foci for the enhancement of STEM
              curricula and infrastructure. This approach will engage students in research
              and strengthen institutional partnerships with private and public sector
              organizations offering enhanced internship opportunities. An assessment
              instrument to track project outcomes and the success of STEM graduates will
              also be developed.
