A scientist from Florida
              State University in collaboration with colleagues from the University of Hawaii
              and the University of Washington will collect a suite of dissolved and
              particulate samples from surface waters and vertical profiles (12 depths), as
              well as atmospheric aerosol and rainwater samples during selected legs of the
              Repeat Hydrography CO2 cruises.  The PIs plan to participate in the following
              four cruises: (1) the North Atlantic Ocean meridional section (20-25'W) during
              2003; (2) the Pacific Ocean zonal section at 30'N during 2004; (3) the South
              Atlantic Ocean meridional section (20-25'W) in 2005; and (4) the South Pacific
              Ocean meridional section (150W) in 2005.  Samples recovered during these
              cruises will be analyzed for Fe and Al.  In addition, aerosol samples will be
              subjected to an ultrapure water leach to assess the fractional solubility of Fe
              and Al.  This team of PIs also plans to collect and archive filtered and
              unfiltered water samples and aerosols for analysis by other scientists in the
              trace metal and tracer community.  The primary objectives of this study is to
              generate an extensive database of Fe and Al concentrations in water and aerosol
              samples that can constrain global and regional dust deposition models and
              determine the role that atmospheric Fe depositions have in delivering Fe to
              surface waters in the major basins of the world's oceans.
