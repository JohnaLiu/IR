Abstract    :
              Gordon Conferences have a long history of informal science exchange. This
              meeting seeks to bring together experimentalists in genomics with various kinds
              of computational and theoretical individuals to pose new problems and
              communicate recent advances.  The focus of the conference is exploring venues
              of integration of structural information on genes and proteins with population
              genetics and evolutionary biology.  The need and character of computational
              tools that will be developed will be part of the overall discussion. 
              Encouraging the information exchange between two separate groups is a key part
              of the plan.
