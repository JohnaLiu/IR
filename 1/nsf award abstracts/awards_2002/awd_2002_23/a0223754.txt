Abstract    :
              The Electrodeposition Gordon Research Conference (GRC) is relatively new,
              started in
1996. It grew out of the Read Conference, one of the primary
              scientific forums for the
electrodeposition community since the early 50's.  
              The understanding of electrodeposition at the atomic scale has increased
              dramatically in recent years as new analytical methods, like scanning tunneling
              microscopy (STM), have been developed. This has resulted in improved control
              over processes, and the ability to use electrodeposition in areas where control
              over the nanometer scale is required. 
Electrodeposition is becoming accepted
              as a standard thin film synthesis methodology in
new areas. A clear example is
              the adoption of electrodeposition by the electronics
industries to form copper
              interconnects in VLSI. Production VLSI circuits use 135 nm wide copper wires,
              with research and development teams currently working on 90 nm and smaller
              copper interconnects. In addition, electrodeposition has a central role in
              nearly all micro-technologies. New areas where it is playing an increasing roll
              include
nanofabrication and the formation of compound semiconductor thin
              films. The 2002
conference has a special highlight on the role of
              electrodeposition in nano- and
micro-fabrication.  This proposal will allow
              the organizers to continue developing the Electrodeposition GRC into the
              premier electrochemical materials conference.
