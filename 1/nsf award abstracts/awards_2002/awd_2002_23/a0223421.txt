              ABSTRACT

OCE-0223421

This investigation will focus on the Atlantic, where
              a large number of the newly available repeat hydrographic transects which
              included carbon measurements were performed, to study temporal variations in
              total inorganic carbon and anthropogenic carbon concentrations and the effects
              these changes could have on oceanic uptake, transport and storage. Since the
              carbon cycle is intimately related to the cycles of other properties within the
              ocean, other available hydrographic variables such as temperature, salinity,
              oxygen, phosphate, silicate, and alkalinity will be included in the study.
              Specifically, this project will
 Provide a physical consistent circulation of
              the entire Atlantic including transports of total Inorganic Carbon and all
              other available properties.
Estimate anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2)
              transport and storage throughout the basin.
Describe temporal variations in
              the carbon cycle within the Atlantic as provided by early 1990's and late
              1990's models.
Determine the validity of the a mean state solution in terms of
              these changes
 Compare CO2 and anthropogenic CO2 divergences to the estimates
              of CO2 air-sea flux of Takahashi.
 Compare CO2 and anthropogenic CO2 results
              to the CO2 model comparison currently being performed at NCAR (S.Doney personal
              communication).

This project is contribution to NSF Integrated Carbon Cycle
              Research Program.
