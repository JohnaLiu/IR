Abstract    :
              This award is for partial support for the Southeastern-Atlantic Regional
              Conference on Differential Equations, which will be held October 11-12, 2002,
              at the University of Tennessee.  The conference has met annually since 1981,
              and provides an opportunity for young investigators to discuss recent
              developments in the field with more senior researchers.  Topics to be discussed
              include ordinary and partial differential equations, integral and functional
              equations, numerical methods, control and inverse problems, and applications to
              science and engineering.  Funds will be used primarily for the support of
              advanced graduate students and recent PhDs.
