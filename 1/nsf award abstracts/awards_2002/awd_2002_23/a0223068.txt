Abstract    :
              This project will conduct an overall evaluation of the GLOBE program.  The
              evaluation will document the program's progress in achieving its objective of
              improving student understanding of science by involving students in real
              science.  SRI will conduct an implementation evaluation and an outcome
              evaluation.  The implementation evaluation will analyze the GLOBE educational
              materials, teachers' access to technology, the influence of standards and
              teaching practice.  The outcome evaluation will measure the impact of GLOBE on
              student learning.
