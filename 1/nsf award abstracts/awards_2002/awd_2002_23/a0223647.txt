This three-year award for US-France cooperative research in
              high performance computing involves Jean-Luc Gaudiot of the University of
              Southern California, Guang Gao of the University of Delaware and Christine
              Eisenbeis at the French National Institute for Research in Informatics and
              Applied Mathematics (INRIA) at Rocquencourt.  The objective of their research
              is simulation of multithreaded multiprocessors for high performance computing. 
              The project adds an international dimension to an active NSF grant on
              functional programming of multithreaded systems.  The US-France collaboration
              focuses on simulation.  The investigators propose to specify, design and
              implement a trace simulator and to identify the sources of parallelism within a
              computer program.

The US investigators bring to this collaboration expertise
              in processor architecture design, multithreaded architecture design and
              application.  This is complemented by French expertise in parallel compilation,
              code analysis and optimization.  The research addresses the development of more
              efficient memory for large-scale parallel scientific computing.
