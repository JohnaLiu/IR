Abstract    :
              This project involves a three-year research program to study the exchanges of
              carbon dioxide between the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, and
              the processes that govern them.  Spatial and temporal variations of isotopic
              tracers in the atmosphere that contain information about the sources and sinks
              of carbon dioxide are being investigated.  The effort involves the use of the
              Simple Biosphere model that describes these processes on land and has been
              successful at predicting variations in carbon dioxide on local, regional, and
              global scales when coupled to an atmospheric model.  New inversion methods to
              estimate carbon fluxes are being developed and tested using synthetic data
              produced by the Community Climate System Mode at the National Center for
              Atmospheric Research.  The sensitivity to transport is being investigated using
              a suite of transport model response functions produced in a model
              intercomparison study.
