The goals of this workshop are
              broad: to bring together a multi-disciplinary group of researchers to shed
              light on the important challenges, the open problems, the promising approaches,
              and to get a general picture of the state of the art in areas related to
              pattern recognition. Each of the eminent researchers listed below
will present
              a 20 minute talk. They come from diverse communities including: computer
              science, applied math, information theory, signal processing, and statistics.
              There will also be representatives from NSF-CISE, NSF-DMS, NSF-BioMed, and
              possibly other federal agencies (CIA, NSA, DoD), who will be attending.
