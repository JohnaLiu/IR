Abstract    :
              The large annual flux of organic carbon from land to the ocean largely
              disappears in the sea. Reasons for this loss are not clear. Under this award,
              the PI will examine abiotic and biotic aspects of the lability to loss of
              riverine particulate organic matter. Work will focus on the Mississippi, as it
              demonstrates the clearest loss of particulate organic material of any North
              American river upon deposition in the ocean. Photochemical experiments will
              follow up on initial work showing significant dissolution of particulate
              organic matter subjected to solar levels of radiation. Interactions with metal
              cycling will be studied, as will a variety of other physicochemical variables.
              Biochemical lability will be explored via enzyme hydrolyses and bacterial
              incubations. Seasonal patterns will be examined, as will be the influence of
              deposition in freshwater environments.
