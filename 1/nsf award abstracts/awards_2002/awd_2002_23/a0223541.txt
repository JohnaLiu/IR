Abstract    :
              National Wildlife productions is developing a large format film, "Predators and
              Prey," and related educational resources.  The film will introduce audiences to
              cutting-edge scientific research through a topic that already captures their
              imagination and will use visually exciting scenes to present the science behind
              predator/prey relations.  A preliminary conceptual structure, general approach
              and potential storyline have already been developed.

The planning phase will
              include the following activities:

-Further define the conceptual structure
              of the film
-Conduct preproduction/front-end audience research
-Refine the
              approaches to the film based on feedback from front-end research
-Plan
              educational resources
-Conduct a front-end survey of large-format film
              theaters to evaluate the title, approach and relevance of proposed educational
              resources.
-Draft a film treatment

The principals for the project bring a
              background of filmmaking and science.  Christopher Palmer, President and CEO,
              National Wildlife Productions (NWP), will serve as Executive Producer for the
              film.  Educational resources will be designed by Jim Stofan, Vice President,
              Education, NWP; and the Chief Science Consultant will be Sterling Miller,
              Senior Wildlife Biologist, NWP.  Treatments and scripts will be written by Mose
              Richards and evaluation will be conducted by Robert Russell.  A committee of
              scientists and science educators will help guide the project during the
              planning phase.
