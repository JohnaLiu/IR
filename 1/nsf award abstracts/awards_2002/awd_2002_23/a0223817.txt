"Spin-electronic Dynamics in Three Terminal
              Coupled Quantum Structures"

This project focuses on exploring enabling
              technologies to allow the spin degree of freedom to be used as the controlling
              mechanism for quantum communication and computing.  The principal investigators
              will fabricate and study coupled quantum-dot (QD) systems consisting of closely
              spaced III-V semiconductor, gallium arsenide (GaAs) quantum dots controlled by
              separated electrodes. The systems will be designed to transmit spin charges
              into QDs and to couple them in the neighboring dots by exchange interaction. 
              Such a system is the first step toward building quantum logic gates, because
              the spin of one dot affects the electronic charge transport in the other dots
              by the exchange coulomb blockage effect. 
 
The spin states and the degree of
              coupling between the quantum dots can also be controlled by applied magnetic
              and/or electric fields.  Magnetic contacts will serve as spin sources to
              provide carriers with particular spin orientation.  The tunneling of these
              carriers through a particular dot will depend on the available spin state in
              the dot.  This provides a convenient and practical way of determining the spin
              orientation of a particular dot and thus the variation of the spin in this dot
              after a certain time interval.  Studying the spin dynamics in the context of
              manipulating and controlling individual spin states in each dot, and
              collectively in coupled quantum dots provides basic technology for fabricating
              quantum transistors and logic gates for quantum computing and communication
              devices. 

Successful fabrication of coupled dot systems requires employing
              state of the art synthetic methods at SUNY Binghamton.  The fabrication of
              electrode structures at nanometer scales will use lithography on metallic thin
              films.  The preparation of semiconductor quantum dots, such as GaAs, in the
              nanometer scales will utilize various synthetic, processing and assembling
              strategies.  Methods will also be developed to produce GaAs:Mn nanoparticles;
              the manganese (Mn) doping can enhance spin state operating temperature in
              quantum dots.  These semiconductor nanoparticles will be characterized using
              spectroscopic and microscopic techniques at both Yale and Binghamton.  

The
              spin charge exchange interaction between neighboring QDs will be studied by
              producing highly monodispersed III-V semiconductor nanoparticles self-assembled
              in a narrow gap about hundreds of nanometers wide between two metallic
              electrodes made by lithography.  The study of detailed tunneling
              characteristics as a function of temperature and bias will be carried out in a
              magnetic cryostat at Binghamton.  At Yale, scanning tunneling microscopy will
              be used to characterize the size, morphology, and electronic properties of the
              nanoparticles and their positioning between the electrodes.  Magneto-infrared
              spectroscopy will be carried out on self-assembled semiconductor nano-particle
              arrays to examine spin exchange coupling between QDs. 

Broader Impact: This
              research will strongly impact future technologies in new functional devices
              based on spin degree of freedom, particularly providing assistance to the
              development of three-terminal spin field-effect-transistors using the developed
              techniques.  These activities will allow the graduate students involved to
              learn and prepare themselves to become future technologists for developing next
              generation communication and computing devices. The integration of the
              nanostructure and novel computing technology into the curricula will provide
              interdisciplinary experiences for better career training for the students
              involved.
