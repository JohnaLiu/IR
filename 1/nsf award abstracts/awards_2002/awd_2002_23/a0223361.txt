Abstract    :
              This project will develop a demonstration system and test-bed for a method of
              using branch prediction and speculative execution in space weather forecasting.
               The WINDMI model, developed by Horton and Doxas, of magnetospheric substorms
              will be used as the basic forecast model, but the branch prediction and
              speculative execution technique is not limited to that particular model.  The
              demonstration system will be a small, portable system that can be taken to
              meetings and workshops for educational and outreach purposes.
