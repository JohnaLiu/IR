Abstract    :
              The PI is organizing an interdisciplinary workshop to provide a forum for
              discussion of the latest advances in nanomaterials to be held in Romania during
              the week of  Sept. 30, 2002.  The challenges and issues with the science and
              application of nanotechnology will be identified and discussed along with
              identification of emerging areas requiring research and analysis.  The specific
              intersection between areas is to be covered, such as quantum mechanics and
              biology, nanoparticles in polymers, electronics and biology, and their
              interactions.
