Abstract    :
              In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning and
              Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is
              designed to meet GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and
              schoolchildren in a global information network with the ultimate goal of better
              understanding Earth's environment and changes that take place within it.  This
              proposal consists of various segments addressing GLOBE Program needs: support
              for existing protocols, development of new protocols, and scientific research
              with GLOBE data.  This proposal will support the current set of GLOBE hydrology
              and snow protocols, strengthen the metadata submission standards, and carry out
              research in seasonal variation in pH and alkalinity due to snowmelt runoff,
              climate variability, and land use change.  Calibration and validation of
              remotely sensed data on water transparency will also be pursued.  This proposal
              will also support the development of materials for education that will include
              hydrology in the context of Earth Systems Science.  Scientists, students, and
              the general public will be able to better understand the role of water in
              ecosystems and their role in the care of our natural resources.
