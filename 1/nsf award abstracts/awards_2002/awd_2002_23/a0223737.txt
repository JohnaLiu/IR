Group Travel Grant For
              Faculty at Minority Institutions to Attend FSE-10

This proposal, supporting
              travel by faculty from institutions with a large minority or female enrollment,
              represents an effort to improve the representation of women and minorities in
              CS. Organized by the ACM SIGSOFT, the Conference on the Foundations of Software
              Engineering (FSE-10), will be held in Charleston, South Carolina, November
              20-22, 2002. Its organizing committee for 2002 developed a plan to help
              increase the participation of faculty from institutions with a large minority
              and/or female student enrollment. Faculty actively involved with the education
              of women and minorities will be invited to attend FSE-10 tutorials and
              conference. Institutions that include Historically Black Colleges, current and
              former women's colleges, and other colleges with large minority enrollments
              will be targeted. As part of the tutorial series, tutorials will be provided
              for the selected faculty that contribute in teaching and stimulating interests
              in software engineering. The effort is expected to transitively develop the
              student's interest.
