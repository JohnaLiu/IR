Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at Columbia
              University investigates ways of forming films containing complex metal oxide
              nanoparticles and the properties of these films through an interdisciplinary
              and collaborative effort.  The Center is composed of a single interdisciplinary
              research group (IRG). The focus of the IRG research is the materials chemistry
              of oxide nanoparticle systems, and includes nanoparticle synthesis, assembly,
              and diagnostics. The Columbia MRSEC links thirteen faculty members from five
              departments on campus with other faculty at City College of New York, and with
              fourteen collaborators in industry and at national laboratories. The MRSEC
              maintains shared experimental facilities that meet the needs of the Center
              research and serve for the training of students.  Education outreach efforts of
              the MRSEC include a summer research experience for undergraduates and for high
              school teachers, and an extensive visitation program to high and middle schools
              in New York City that brings materials demonstrations to teachers and
              students.

Participants in the Center currently include 13 senior
              investigators, 3 postdoctoral associates, 8 graduate students, 10 undergraduate
              students and 1 support personnel.   Professor Irving P. Herman directs the
              MRSEC.
