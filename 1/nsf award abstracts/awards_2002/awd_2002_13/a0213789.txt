Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              diagnostic instrument to detect molecular species, such as nitric oxide,  in
              exhaled breath  as a  biomarker of airway inflammation to  assess the
              effectiveness and compliance of asthma therapies. This project  will result in
              the fabrication of a biosensor suitable for clinical use. Pre-clinical studies
              will be performed during the Phase I research  to ensure that a proper protocol
              has been established. The follow on Phase II project will incorporate  clinical
              trials in preparation for FDA approval. 

The commercial applications of this
              project will be in the area of biomedical diagnostic devices and
              instrumentation. It is hoped that the instrument developed in the course of
              this project will acquire a good share of the $1 billion a year asthma
              diagnosis and treatment monitoring market.
