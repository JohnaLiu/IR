Abstract    :
              An imaging system is assembled based on a very fast (18,000-40,000 frames per
              second) video camera and an arc lamp producing a large-area, collimated,
              high-intensity beam.  The equipment will be used in studies of arc-anode
              attachment instabilities, the mechanism of droplet formation in wire arc
              spraying, a reacting countercurrent shear layer in a combustor configuration,
              and cathode erosion mechanisms for very-high-current plasma torches.
