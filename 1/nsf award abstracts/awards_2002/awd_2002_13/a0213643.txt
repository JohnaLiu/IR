Abstract    :
              This investigation is part of a larger project involving a survey of a random
              sample of contributors to each of the nine candidates who raised over five
              million dollars before July 31, 2000 and who sought either of the two major
              party nominations.  This survey is the first of its kind to include both large
              ($200 and more) and small (under $200) donors.   

The main theses being
              investigated involve the representativeness of the contributor pool as a
              subsample of the public, the impacts of candidate and contributor attitudes on
              the contribution decision, and the motivations for contributor' political
              activism.  The central theoretical claims of the research promise to enhance
              substantially our understanding of this topic.

These funds allow the
              investigators to ensure that the completed questionnaires that they have
              received can be coded promptly, facilitating timely analysis of the data.
The
              dataset to be produced will be of significant interest to numerous scholars
              interested in this topic.
