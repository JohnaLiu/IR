Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project addresses the
              development of Innovative Phase Shifter Utilizing Nonreciprocal Resonator. In a
              nonreciprocal resonator, such as a ferrite disk, wave propagation is
              non-degenerate, and the resonant modes all assume at differently frequencies.
              Thus, for a given resonant mode its phase is unambiguous, allows it to be
              coupled out providing the function of a phase shifter. Phase shift obtained in
              this manner is uniform, and the operation is independent of the phase angle
              obtained. The phase shifter for this project will be compact in size, providing
              360 degrees phase angle with low insertion loss. Furthermore, it allows for
              circuit minimization facilitating fabrication as a large array. 

Potential
              commercial applications include Low-cost, small-volume collision avoidance
              radar capable of beam steering.
