Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to use functionalized, fluorinated allenes to develop new
              fluorinated ring construction methodologies.  They will first prepare a number
              of mono and difluoroallenes.  The metallation, alkylation and substitution
              reactions of these compounds will be investigated followed by a study of their
              use in cyclization reactions to prepare both fluorinated heterocycles and
              carbocycles.  

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program is supporting the research of Dr. Gerald B. Hammond of the University
              of Massachusetts at Dartmouth.  Dr. Hammond and his student co-workers will
              study the preparation and reaction chemistry of a number of organofluorine
              molecules known as fluorinated allenes.  Many pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals
              are organofluorine containing molecules and this group will be devloping new
              synthetic groutes to these types of molecules.  Students trained during the
              course of this work will gain experience in synthetic organofluorine chemistry
              and be acquiring skills needed by the pharmaceutical and agrochemical
              industries.
