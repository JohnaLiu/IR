Abstract    :
              This proposal builds off Professor Hutchison's recent discovery of a new class
              of chelating bicyclic diamide ligands that exhibit dramatic enhancements in
              binding affinity for the f-block elements compared to the large class of
              ligands based upon the malonamide substructure. The new ligand class, the
              3,9-diaza-3,9- dialkylbicyclo[ 4.4.0]decane-2, 10-diones, were identified using
              a rational approach utilizing molecular mechanics modeling. The preorganized
              bicyclic structure ideally positions the two carbonyl groups for optimal
              metal-ligand interaction. A highly efficient and versatile synthesis of this
              ligand class has been developed and ion extraction experiments have shown a 3
              to 5 million-fold enhancement in affmity for f- block ions when compared to
              several analogous acyclic diamides. This initial discovery suggests a rich
              class of ligands can be prepared wherein the binding affinity for f- block
              elements can be widely tuned. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify
              methods by which the new ligands can be rationally designed and rapidly
              optimized through an integrated theory, synthesis and testing program. The
              three primary objectives in this proposal are designed to help elucidate the
              design criteria that dictate the properties of this new class of ligands. These
              objectives are (i) developing synthetic methods that permit wide variation of
              the ligand structure (ranging from the nature and position of alkyl and aryl
              substituents to the ring sizes within the bicyclic structure), (ii)
              investigating the solution and solid-state coordination chemistry of the new
              ligands and relating this chemistry back to the ligand design and (iii)
              incorporating these ligands into functional materials (polymers, organic thin
              films). 

 With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the research of Professor James Hutchison of the University of Oregon
              whose work involves ligand design, synthetic chemistry, spectroscopy methods,
              coordination chemistry, crystallography, solvent extraction, and materials
              chemistry. This work will enhance student training through exposure to a wide
              range of research. It will also contribute to society by targeting such
              applications as nuclear fuel reprocessing and high-level waste management, and
              sensitizers for lanthanide luminesence in fluorescent probes and sensors.
