Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 Project is to develop
              microarrays for analyzing thousands of sequences of DNA for genomic and
              diagnostic applications. The microarrays would be made from sol-gel coatings
              with specific microstructures. These substrates will allow higher density
              arrays and higher signal/noise ratio from each of the array elements. This will
              result in increasing analytical throughput with an  improved accuracy in
              detection and reproducibility of the data.
     The commercial applications of
              this project will be in the areas of healthcare and agriculture.
