Abstract    :
              In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Levis will investigate the behavior of molecules in the
              presence of intense laser pulses.  A long-range goal of these studies is the
              control of chemical reactions in the gaseous and eventually the solution phase.
               Special experimental and theoretical tools will be developed towards the
              realization of these goals. 

Chemical reactions most often occur along
              reaction paths that are determined by the intrinsic properties of the
              reactants.  Reactions that lead to desirable reaction products are then not
              realized unless means are found to control the reactions by means of external
              intervention.  One hopeful method to achieve such control is through
              modification of the intrinsic molecular properties in the presence of very
              intense laser fields.  The goal of this project is to devise experimental and
              theoretical techniques that lead to the control of chemical reactions. 
              Students and postdoctoral research associates participate in this research.
