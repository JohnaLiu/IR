This award will support an important upgrade to the
              superconducting rock magnetometer (2G Enterprises 760R three axis system) and
              will support the addition of a high sensitivity Kappabridge for the
              Paleomagnetism Laboratory at the University of New Mexico.   The upgrade and
              equipment acquisition will considerably enhance the capability of our
              laboratory in paleomagnetic and rock magnetic research, which is and has been
              utilized by a range of University of New Mexico (UNM) and outside researchers. 
              The magnetometer upgrade will greatly improve the overall operation of the
              laboratory and will involve (1) replacing the Rf-driven SQuIDs with DC SQuIDS,
              affording at least an order of magnitude greater moment sensitivity over the
              existing Rf-driven SQuIDS, (2) reducing the specimen access region from 7.6 cm
              diameter to 4.2 cm, (3) retrofitting the magnetometer with improved
              superinsulation, allowing for a considerably decreased liquid helium boil-off
              rate, and (4) replacing part of the liquid helium fill line with an enlarged
              access line, to prevent the nagging development of major freezing (and
              blockage) of the line.  These upgrades to the magnetometer will improve our
              ability to measure very weakly magnetized rocks that typically defy our best
              attempts to extract useful information near the current threshold of the
              magnetometer.  The requested new susceptibility system, will be used to measure
              bulk and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility of a range of geologic
              materials.
