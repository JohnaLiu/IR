Abstract    :
              The proposal is to establish a US-EU/DELOS working group/study panel on
              "Reference Models for Digital Libraries".  The working group will meet over the
              next year to discuss and evaluate fruitful joint activities and research paths
              for collaborative activities in this general topical area.  The EU component of
              the effort is funded and managed by the DELOS Forum, a major organizer of
              digital libraries research and planning activities in Europe.  DELOS receives
              support from the Information Societies Technologies (IST) 5th Framework
              Programme of the European Commission. 

This effort continues the planning
              and assessment activities begun by an earlier NSF-EU working groups' process. 
              In their final report "An International Research Agenda for Digital Libraries",
              delivered in Brussels in October 1998, increased levels of collaboration and
              interaction was seen as critical to building multi-lingual, multi-national
              digital libraries. The objective of the new working groups, of which this is
              one, is to define a research agenda on a specific topic and identify areas and
              activities for cooperation between EU and US researchers. The efforts of this
              particular group take the next step in the planning process by assessing future
              directions for research and resource development related to modeling the nature
              of actors and roles in digital libraries.
