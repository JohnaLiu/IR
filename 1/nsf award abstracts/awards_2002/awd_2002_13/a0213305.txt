Abstract    :
              This grant is for the development of computational tools for
simulating very
              large-scale problems involving granular flow.
Rather than use a continuum
              model of a granular material (which
involves a large number of assumptions and
              approximations about the
way they behave), rather we look at the computational
              challenges in
discrete element models.
These are challenging large-scale
              problems with thousands to millions
of grains that have to be
              simulated.
Direct interactions are usually between touching grains.
However,
              one grain can not only affect the others that it touches, but
those will
              affect their neighbors, and so on.
Further, the network of interactions is
              dynamic.
Indeed, the overall pattern of interactions can become
              very
different depending on the circumstances: if a sand table is
              shaken,
then most of the sand grains will be independent; when the
              grains
settle, each grain will be touching many others.
In order to
              efficiently organize the computational tasks, we need to
use techniques from
              graph or network theory.
These tools include graph partitioning techniques,
              graph coloring
techniques, and new techniques for handling the collisions of
              grains.
Since the problems are very large scale, currently
              available
techniques often have to be adapted from dealing with
              small-scale
problems to deal with large-scale problems.
Furthermore, since
              the network of interactions is dynamic, these
techniques have to be adapted to
              use information about the previous
network in order to efficiently obtain the
              corresponding information
about the new network.
In this project, we will be
              developing these tools and drawing
techniques from graph theory, continuous
              optimization, complementarity
theory, and computational geometry.

Granular
              materials are materials made of small, relatively hard
objects that collide
              off each other.
Sand, breakfast cereals, talcum powder, and a box of marbles
              are all
examples of granular materials.
Understanding these materials and
              simulating their behavior directly
is difficult because the position and
              velocity of each of the
``grains'' in the material needs to be tracked and
              updated as they
move and collide.
In order to do this well, we need
              high-performance computers, and we
need to use them well.
The crucial problem
              is to understand the nature of the interactions
between the grains, and to
              develop automatic tools that can determine
how to divide the computational
              tasks so that they can be tackled
efficiently on high-performance and parallel
              computers.
