Abstract    :
              B. Patrick Sullivan of the University of Wyoming is supported by the Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for research on synthesis of
              linear oligomeric rhenium complexes, and investigation of their photoexcitation
              and electron-transfer properties. Both diphosphines and cyano groups will be
              used as bridging ligands, in order to favor directional electron or energy
              transfer through restriction of conformational flexibility. New synthetic
              procedures will be developed in order to build oligomeric rhenium complexes
              with specific lengths, and having properties that will facilitate directional
              energy and electron transfer. Studies of the dynamics of selected processes
              will also be carried out to optimize efficiency of energy transfer down the
              oligomeric chain. Later stages of the work will deal with rectification at
              semiconductor (titania) interfaces, and use of Mn-based chromophores as
              surrogates for Re complexes. 

This research addresses factors that
              facilitate directional electron and energy transport, an important problem with
              wide potential applicability. Substantial preliminary results indicate that the
              proposed research has a good likelihood of success.  The results may well be
              important in development of practical methods for solar energy collection. The
              proposed research will also provide excellent training for students and
              post-doctoral associates.
