Abstract    :
              This award is to support research that will develop a network of tree-ring
              records covering the past 3,000 years from the western United States.  These
              data will be used to understand the temporal and geographic variability of
              Holocene climate in western North America.

Field work will be undertaken to
              obtain tree-ring records of appropriate length from regions currently lacking
              high resolution time series.  Existing tree-ring archives will be carefully
              analyzed to select the best 3000+ year records of climate.  These records will
              be integrated into a network with sufficient geographic coverage to be useful
              for ocean-atmosphere modeling studies.  The resulting network of records will
              be used to produce a variety of climate reconstructions ranging from long
              regional reconstructions to synoptic reconstructions of the western United
              States.
 
The broader impacts of this proposed research center on the
              development of a network of high resolution climate records from the western
              United States that can be used to fully explore the range and frequency of
              climate change.  This tool is presently not available and will have a wide
              range of applications for paleoclimatology, oceanography and other
              subdisciplines of climate change.
