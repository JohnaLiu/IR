Abstract    :
              Prejudice creates barriers for the learning and development of children from all
              racial and ethnic groups. With the increasing diversity of youth in North
              America, it is particularly timely and important to make progress toward
              understanding and reducing racial prejudice. Recent social and developmental
              research clarifies the multifaceted nature of prejudice and the need for an
              inter-disciplinary approach to addressing prejudice. This program of research
              integrates and expands advances in social psychological research on attitude
              change with advances in developmental research on children's cognitive
              capacities and limitations into the Social-Cognitive-Developmental Model of
              mechanisms underlying racial attitude change. This integrative model will be
              examined via multiple methods including observations, social-cognitive skill
              training, longitudinal assessments, and meta-analyses. The project will make
              theoretical and empirical contributions to social and developmental research on
              mechanisms underlying racial attitude change and will produce concrete
              recommendations for age-specific prejudice reduction interventions that benefit
              children who live and learn in a diverse society.
