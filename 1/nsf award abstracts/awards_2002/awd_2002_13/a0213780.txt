Abstract    :
              This Major Research Instrumentation award to Sea Education Association in Woods
              Hole, Massachusetts provides funds for acquisition of oceanographic research
              instrumentation for use on the SEA vessel SSV Corwith Cramer.  Instruments
              supported here will be used in the SEA Semester and related seagoing programs,
              involving undergraduates, K-12 students and teachers in hands-on marine
              research and seamanship.  Specific instruments supported here include an
              acoustic current profiler, sonars for sounding and sub-bottom profiling,
              sensors for analysis of physical, chemical and biological properties of surface
              and subsurface waters, a computer network for data acquisition and analysis,
              and other instruments for research and training.  The project is supported by
              the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF. Sea Education Association will provide
              cost-share support from non-federal funds for a portion of total project costs.
