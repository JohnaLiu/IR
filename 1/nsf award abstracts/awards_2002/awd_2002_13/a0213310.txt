Abstract    :
              The Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division makes this award to
              University of California Riverside to develop novel open framework chalcogenide
              materials to advance new synthetic and structural concepts, and to better
              understand self-assembly processes and host-guest interactions.  With this
              award, Professor Feng will study interactions between organic molecules and the
              semiconductor nanocrystal precursors to generate larger clusters, and to
              organize these clusters with controlled surface properties into 3-dimensional
              ordered frameworks. Properties of these clusters and their 3-D assemblies will
              be controlled by changing the composition and interactions between their
              inorganic and organic components.  The synthesis of larger nanocrystals may
              lead to better understanding of material transition between molecules and
              colloidal nanocrystals, which in turn will help to control nucleation and
              growth processes in the synthesis of semiconductor materials.

Research
              studies will be carried out in the synthesis and characterization of
              semiconductor nanoclusters and 3-dimensional ordered frameworks to enhance the
              understanding of nanocrystal synthesis and assembly of semiconductor materials,
              which will have potential applications in magnetic and electrooptic devices. 
              Instructional and research training in solid state and materials chemistry will
              be provided to graduate and undergraduate students with this award.
