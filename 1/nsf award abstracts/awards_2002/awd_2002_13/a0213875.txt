Abstract    :
              This project is related to the digitization of the Television News Archive at
              Vanderbilt University.  The issues to be addressed during the project
              include:

1. Evaluation of alternate delivery technologies (streaming video
              methods and different kinds of video servers).

2. Technology for identifying
              program segments, and labeling the results of the segmentation.

3.
              Acquisition methods for future content acquisition.

4. Time stamp technology
              and uses.

5. Algorithms and processes for signal conditioning for increasing
              quality of the data archive.

The Vanderbilt archive is crucial for
              historians: it contains the only records of TV news for some years starting in
              1968.  However, it is currently stored on obsolete analog technology.  This
              proposal takes advantage of the need to digitize the material to explore
              techniques that could be applied to many other kinds of video digitization
              projects.
