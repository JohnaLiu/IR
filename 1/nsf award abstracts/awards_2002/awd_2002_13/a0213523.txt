Abstract    :
              This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research by Alison Butler, University of California Santa Barbara
              Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. Butler is studying haloperoxidase
              enzymes, more specifically the vanadium bromoperoxidases found in several types
              of marine algae. The mechanisms of these enzymes and the biogenesis of
              halogenated terpene and acetogenin marine natural products will be explored.
              Using site-directed mutagenesis, Butler will determine the functional role of
              selected amino acid residues in the enzymes and prepare mutants suitable for in
              vitro reactivity. These mutants may eventually be used for the industrial
              synthesis of halogenated compounds suitable for medical applications.

In
              addition to the fundamental bioinorganic chemistry and enzymology proposed, the
              work has broad implications for marine biology and pharmaceutical chemistry.
              Butler also trains a diverse group of students in an emerging interdisciplinary
              field
