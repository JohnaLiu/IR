Abstract    :
              Rigoberto Hernandez of the Georgia Institute of Technology is supported by the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop models that describe
              nonstationary dynamics in chemical reactivity.  The major objectives of this
              research are (1) to develop non-phenomenological formulations of existing
              irreversible generalized Langevin equation (iGLE) models and direct
              isomorphisms between the latter and nontrivial chemical systems; (2) to explore
              nonstationary models that do not have the multiplicative structure of the iGLE;
              and (3) to explore chemical applications to polymerization and protein folding
              dynamics of the nonstationary models with new chemical insights and
              techniques.

The expected outcome of this research is an improved
              understanding of the chemistry that takes place under heterogeneous
              nonequilibrium conditions.  For example, the reaction conditions in solid-state
              polymerization strongly determine the final polymer distribution.  Similarly,
              the time-dependent viscosity of a thermosetting polymer is an  important
              characteristic in the reaction injection mold processing of encapsulants.
