Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Elena Benedicto will conduct six
              months of linguistic research on Ken Hale's Misumalpan files. Hale - a linguist
              particularly productive in his work on indigenous languages - died recently. He
              had been working with Benedicto on these languages for several years. She and
              her consultants will complete Hale's contribution to this research by
              recovering and incorporating his notes. This project is significant for two
              main reasons: (1) It will complete the only systematic work on the Misumalpan
              languages, an isolate group with unique morpho-phonological and
              sytactico-semantic properties. (2) It will enhance the already-established
              collaboration between Benedicto and the Intercultural Bilingual Program in
              Nicaragua.
