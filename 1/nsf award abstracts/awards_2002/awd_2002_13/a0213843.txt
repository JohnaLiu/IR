Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I addresses the development
              of a remote-telemetry compatible sensor for measuring reductions in methyl
              tertiary butyl ether levels in soil at underground storage tank cleanup sites. 
              At present, there are over 160,000 sites with petroleum and methyl tertiary
              butyl ether contaminated soil, which poses a significant threat to the
              environment as well as human health and safety. In addition, there are
              approximately 286,000 underground storage tanks that pose a significant risk to
              the environment because they are not in compliance with federally mandated leak
              detection requirements.

This sensor would enable the development of a new
              and improved chemical detection system for identifying methyl tertiary butyl
              ether levels in soil and to accurately determine the risks of underground
              storage tanks in cleanup sites.
