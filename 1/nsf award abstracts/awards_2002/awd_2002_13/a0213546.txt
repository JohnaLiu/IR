This award will permit the purchase of a new 500 MHz NMR
              spectrometer to complement the existing spectrometer in the Keck Solid-State
              NMR Facility at the University of California at Davis.  This new instrument is
              a wide-bore 500 MHz spectrometer with all of the features necessary for
              state-of-the-art multi-resonance, multi-dimensional studies of solid samples. 
              The new spectrometer will be used for studies in Chemistry, Materials Science
              and Earth Science, although the principal investigators (PIs) of this proposal
              are earth scientists with immediate research needs.  The PIs have integrated
              research that examines the earliest stages of mineral growth from solution and
              the controls on reaction rates.  The PIs research groups rely heavily on NMR
              spectroscopy because it provides structural and kinetic information on X-ray
              amorphous materials in situ, including information about rates of chemical
              exchange over a large range in timescales.  Purchase of this new spectrometer
              is supported by the University of California because it is also key to campus
              initiatives for growth of interdisciplinary research and faculty recruitment in
              the Earth and Environmental Sciences.  Environmental materials are commonly
              poorly crystalline oxides or biomolecules where NMR spectroscopy is often the
              only suitable method for determining structure.
