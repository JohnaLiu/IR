Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Shobhana Chelliah and Willem de
              Reuse will conduct three years of linguistic research on Western Apache, a
              Native American language spoken by approximately 13,000 people in central and
              eastern Arizona. Tribal members, educators, and linguists have been concerned
              about the loss of Western Apache, a language that has played a major role in
              the culture and history of the American Southwest. At present, less than 3% of
              Apache children are acquiring Western Apache as a first language, and thus the
              language may no longer be spoken by the end of this century. This project will
              result in the first comprehensive dictionary of the language. This dictionary
              will provide reliable and consistent spellings, attestations of words no longer
              used, grammatical analyses, full conjugations for the verbs, and example
              sentences for each word.

This project is significant for several reasons.
              The Western Apache Dictionary will be used for the design and implementation of
              language revitalization and teaching programs. It will be made available in
              paper and electronic format, allowing for the generation of supplementary
              children's and learners' dictionaries. The dictionary will also be a reference
              for linguists interested in the structure of non-western languages or in
              comparing Apache with related languages such as Navajo. Anthropologists and
              ethnohistorians may also use these materials.
