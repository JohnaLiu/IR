Abstract    :
              
In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Janda will study IVR processes in molecules and clusters
              embedded in liquid helium droplets at a temperature of 0.4 K. Appropriate
              pico-second pump-probe techniques and pulsed valve technology will be developed
              for both reactant preparation and monitoring the chemical dynamics inside the
              clusters.

When gases are cooled to very low temperatures they usually
              condense into a liquid or solid form. When trapped into ultra-cold droplets of
              liquid helium, molecules and clusters largely retain their rotational and
              vibrational degrees of freedom. Their properties apparent at ordinary
              temperatures are only slightly modified owing to the weak interaction that
              couples them to the surrounding bath of liquid helium. The studies of these
              modifications are of intrinsic interest as they provide fundamental data about
              the properties of liquid helium and may be relevant to eventual chemical
              reactions that take place in the ultra-cold environment of the droplets. This
              research will be conducted with graduate and undergraduate students and
              postdoctoral research associates.  They will acquire knowledge and training in
              one of the forefront areas of physical chemistry in preparation for entry into
              the scientific/technical workforce.
