Abstract    :
              Professor McGrath and his group will work on developing new methodology for the
              controlled degradation of dendritic materials.  The acid lability of the benzyl
              aryl ether subunit found in many dendrimers will be used as a trigger for
              degradation.  Dendrimers with depolymerizable backbones will also be prepared
              and degraded.  Release of degradation fragments which have been covalently
              incorporated into the dendrimer will be monitored so that the process can be
              understood and modified as necessary.

With this award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Dominic V.
              McGrath of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona.  Dr.
              McGrath and his students will work on the controlled degradation of dendritic
              materials.  Controlled degradation of dendritic materials could have potential
              applications in controlled release of pharmaceuticals for drug delivery and as
              precursors for photoresists for microlithography.  The students trained during
              the course of this interdisciplinary work will gain skills needed by the
              pharmaceutical, polymer and speciality chemicals industries.
