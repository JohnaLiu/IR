Abstract    :
              This research project addresses the effect of atomic scale structure and
              composition on the reactivity of bimetallic alloy surfaces for catalytic
              processes.  With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
              Professor Koel and his co-workers in the Department of Chemistry at the
              University of Southern California, use scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray
              photoelectron diffraction, and ion scattering spectroscopy to examine the
              structure, composition and morphology of Pt-Sn, Pt-Ge, and Pt-Ti alloy
              surfaces.  This information is correlated with small molecule catalytic
              activity on these surfaces, using temperature programmed desorption and
              infrared spectroscopy to monitor the surface reaction kinetics.  Information
              obtained from these studies improves our fundamental understanding of catalysis
              on complex heterogeneous surfaces. 

Atomic scale structural and
              compositional information is correlated with surface reaction kinetics in these
              studies, carried out in the laboratory of Professor Bruce Koel at USC.  The
              identification of the reactive site for catalytic processes on alloy surfaces
              is the goal of this work.  Fundamental insight into the operation of catalytic
              surfaces is obtained from these studies.
