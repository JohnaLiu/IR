Abstract    :
              It is proposed to purchase a rheometer for the purpose of research and research
              training in the dynamics of non-Newtonian fluids.  More specifically, research
              will be performed on polymer melts, multiphase systems, and biomedical
              materials.  This equipment will be used by six faculty members in Chemical
              Engineering and Mechanical Engineering Departments of CUNY City College, and
              one faculty member of Columbia University.
