Abstract    :
              The proposed research is a series of experiments that directly examine the
              causes of adaptive radiation and its effects on populations and communities of
              organisms over short and long time scales. Populations of the bacterium
              Escherichia coli will be used as a model system.  The rapid generation time and
              the ability to viably store bacterial cells at  -80C allow direct observation
              of adaptive radiation and direct comparison of ancestral and descendent
              individuals.  Previous research has already demonstrated that adaptive
              radiation can occur in experimental populations of bacteria, our studies will
              be the first to systematically determine the effects of multiple factors
              (environmental and genetic) on replicated populations.

Adaptive radiation is
              a fundamental process in the evolution of biodiversity.  Many of the well-known
              examples of evolution are of adaptive radiation, including Darwin's Finches,
              Hawaiian Honeycreepers, and African cichlids.  However, the factors causing and
              shaping adaptive radiation are only partially understood, primarily since the
              history of life can only be investigated indirectly.  Because of this,
              essential information on phylogenetic history and environmental conditions is
              often imprecise.  Species interactions are particularly difficult to study as
              they are neither prone to fossilization nor do they appear to have systematic
              effects on diversity.
