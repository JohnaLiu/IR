Abstract    :
              The Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division makes this RUI award to
              Spelman College to fabricate photonic bandgap crystals of ZnGeP2 that exhibit
              substantial birefringence, and thus will have well-established applications in
              the form of conventional phase-matched NLO devices.  With this award, Professor
              McCall will be using following approaches to study the photonic bandgap
              crystals: 1) optimize liquid phase epitaxy of ZnSiP2-ZnGeP2/GaP
              heterostructures, guided by theoretical modeling and simulations of homogeneous
              chemical kinetics, coupled to convective and diffusive transport of reactive
              precursors to surface reactions that feed epitaxial growth; 2) fabricate
              ZnSiP2-ZnGeP2/GaP photonic bandgap crystals by selective chemical soft solution
              machining and digital vapor etching, including electrochemical and
              photochemical approaches, and to develop the theoretical basis for the
              understanding of these fabrication processes; and 3) study the structural,
              electrical and optical properties of ZnSiP2-ZnGeP2 photonic bandgap crystals
              with optimum interfacial refractive index offsets of the fabricated
              materials.

With this award, photonic bandgap crystals will be fabricated,
              and their structural, electrical and optical properties will be determined
              including theoretical modeling and simulations.  These crystals would be useful
              for the integration of NLO waveguides and tunable sources of coherent infrared
              radiation into compact and robust systems for the detection and classification
              of infrared spectroscopic signatures of chemical and biochemical agents.  The
              proposed studies will provide undergraduate students with comprehensive hands
              on experience in research, supplemented by computational solutions to problems
              of physical chemistry and materials science with practical applications.  In
              addition, the project has the potential to attract more under-represented
              minority students to careers in science.
