Abstract    :
              Democratic politics, for the purpose of theoretical analysis, might be divided
              into electoral politics, in which voters determine representatives, and
              post-electoral politics, in which representatives determine public policy.
              Whereas the study of electoral politics focuses on the candidate entry
              decision, the conduct of campaigns, and the incentives of voters, the study of
              post-electoral politics abstracts from these details and focuses on the process
              of negotiation and coalition formation among representatives, within a
              parliament or legislature, or across different branches of government.  This
              project studies post-electoral politics from a game-theoretic perspective,
              where one specifies a mathematical model of the institutional setting in which
              public policy is made, and where one employs concepts of equilibrium to predict
              the outcomes of rational strategic behavior. In technical terms, the project
              analyzes post-electoral politics as a "bargaining game" among elected
              representatives.  The objective is a theory of post-electoral politics that can
              yield sharp predictions in highly structured situations, as when debate
              revolves around one issue and positions of representatives are clear, and that
              is general enough to describe broad properties of policy outcomes, such as
              Pareto efficiency or the stability of the status quo, in less transparent
              contexts. The project is divided into four parts:  the first part proves that,
              in one-dimensional problems, the unique outcome of strategic bargaining is the
              ideal outcome of the middle (or "median") voter; the second part assumes less
              structure on the problem and considers issues of equilibrium existence, the
              stability of the status quo, etc.; the third part considers the strategic
              aspects of agenda formation in legislatures; and the fourth part examines the
              dynamics of policy outcomes over time.

Because it applies advanced methods
              from theoretical economics to the analysis of political issues, the results of
              the project will contribute both to the political science literature on
              legislative, parliamentary, and committee decision-making, and to the
              literature in economics on bargaining and game theory. From an academic
              standpoint, the project will improve our understanding of post-electoral
              politics and is a step toward a general theory that integrates the analyses of
              both electoral and post-electoral politics.  And this, from a long-range
              perspective, is a necessary step in the full understanding of existing
              political systems, the impact of political reforms, and the design of better
              political institutions.
