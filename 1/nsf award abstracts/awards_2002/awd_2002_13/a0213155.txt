One of the most important goals in environmental biology is
              understanding how changing, variable climates effect the distribution of plants
              and animals. In the U.S., it is known that the end of the last major glaciation
              about 20,000 years ago was a period of extreme climate change, with mile-thick
              ice sheets extending south of Chicago and New York City. It is suspected that
              these ice sheets had other climatological effects, including a period of
              extreme dryness that extended over much of the Great Plains and Rocky
              Mountains.  

Research is proposed that seeks to understand the effects of
              this drying period by sampling the DNA of multiple vertebrate species with
              different ecological tolerances, and analyzing them for characteristic patterns
              of variation that are associated with range contraction followed by range
              expansion. Thus, the animals that currently live in the Great Plains will
              provide information, via their DNA, how climatological events affected them
              20,000 years ago.  This work will be conducted on National Wildlife Refuges and
               Long Term Ecological Research sites, employing and training local high school
              and college students from across the country.  This research will allow us to
              better understand why some parts of our country have very high species
              diversity while others are low, as well as how future climate changes will
              affect patterns of animal diversity.
