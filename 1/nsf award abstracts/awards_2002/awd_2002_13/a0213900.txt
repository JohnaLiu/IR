Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I Project will examine the
              feasibility of long-term preservation of shrimp embryos using gene transfer
              technology. Encysted embryos of the brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana, are
              resistant to extreme environmental stress including temperature, salt, anoxia
              and desiccation. A small heat shock crystallin protein (p26) gene identified
              from A. franciscana has been shown to play a major role in the brine shrimp's
              ability to tolerate environmental stress. This Phase I Project proposes to
              introduce the p26 gene into the commercially important marine shrimp,
              Litopenaeus vannamei, through micro-injection and electroporation techniques,
              and to use the shrimp -actin promoter (that has previously been isolated from
              L. vannamei) to drive the expression of the p26 gene, resulting in the
              production of transgenic shrimp capable of surviving harsh environmental
              conditions.
     The commercial application of this project will be in the
              marine shrimp industry.
