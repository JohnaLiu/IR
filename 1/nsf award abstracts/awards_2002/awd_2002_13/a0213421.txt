Abstract    :
              This study will use a combination of numerical and laboratory (analog) models to
              investigate the dispersal and interaction between plume heads and the overlying
              lithospheric plates upon which they impinge. Models will include the effects of
              melting, on and off-axis cases, and the influence of ridge segmentation and
              plate rheology on along-axis flow.  Models include both 2D and 3D numerical
              models and 3D scaled analog ones. The modeling will include both plume heads
              (LIPs), and their more steady-state tails. In general, the experiments will
              explore the thermal, compositional, and dynamic evolution of plume heads for a
              range of conditions. More specific models will examine the case of the
              Ontong-Java plateau system- the earth's largest known plume head. The modeling
              efforts are part of a cycle of observations, theory, predictions, more
              observation which is expected to lead to specific  ODP drilling proposals.
