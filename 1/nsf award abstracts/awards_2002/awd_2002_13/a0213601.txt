Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project concerns the
              novel application of cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy to determine the
              carbon isotope ratio of carbon dioxide emitting from deep-sea hydrothermal
              vents. Although, this isotope ratio has recently been identified as an
              indicator of biological activity, the currently used analytical methods are
              expensive and inaccurate. The aim of this Phase I proposal is to design a
              portable cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy system to accurately determine
              isotope ratios of deep-sea samples in situ. Preliminary results suggest that
              the system can determine isotope ratios to better than 0.1 percent, which is
              sufficient to determine the presence of biological activity.

This effort
              will provide an accurate determination of carbon isotope ratios in an
              inexpensive, portable device.  It will also have significant commercial impact
              in medical diagnostics, the petroleum industry, and environmental monitoring.
              Projected sales of the ratiometer in the former two areas alone are expected to
              exceed $65M over the next five years. Moreover, the proposed prototype can be
              readily modified to monitor various industrial gases, further increasing its
              commercial impact.
