Funding from this grant supports the acquisition of
              equipment to measure fundamental magnetic properties of rocks.   Specifically,
              a Variable Field Translation Balance will be purchased to allow for the
              determination of magnetic grain sizes and thermal parameters (Curie points) to
              help screen desirable and undesirable magnetic materials in paleomagnetic
              projects conducted at the University of Hawaii, Paleomagnetics and Petrofabrics
              laboratory.  Research that will benefit from the new instrument centers on
              high-resolution examination of records of the earth's magnetic field behavior
              including records of secular variation, polarity transitions and intensity
              variations.
