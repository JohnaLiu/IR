Abstract    :
              Human activity is changing local and global environments at unprecedented rates.
               Some of the most significant changes involve widespread nutrient enrichment
              and changes in species composition as well as global warming and sea level
              rise.  Predicting the effects of these multiple stresses is particularly
              important in coastal salt marshes because they are among the most biologically
              productive areas in the world and are heavily used by humans for a variety of
              purposes.  Coastal areas are now experiencing changes in nutrient loading,
              species composition and sea level rise 5-10 fold higher than measured over the
              last century. This project addresses the question: Over the long run, how will
              an increase in nutrients interact with changes in species composition to alter
              coastal ecosystem structure and function? We will conduct field experiments in
              which salt marsh ecosystems are altered by addition of nutrients and by removal
              of an abundant and important fish, the mummichog. We will follow the effects of
              these manipulations on the food web and nutrient cycles for four years. The
              experiments will be linked to a model that can be used to predict the saltmarsh
              response over decades. The results of this research will be useful to managers
              who are faced daily with resolving the conflicts among the many ways that
              humans use coastal regions.
