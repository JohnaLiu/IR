Abstract    :
              Stereotyping and prejudice continue to be predominant social problems in modern
              society. The attacks of September 11, 2001 illustrate this in a variety of
              ways, from the prejudice of terrorists seeking to destroy the Western way of
              life, to the reactions of Americans who turned violent against "Arab-appearing"
              individuals in the United States. These phenomena raise an important question
              for understanding the nature of stereotyping and its consequences for prejudice
              and discrimination: How do individuals keep their stereotypes from influencing
              judgment and behavior? Recent two-stage models of stereotyping suggest that
              people can do this in two distinct ways: (1) By preventing stereotypic
              knowledge from coming to mind so it is never relevant to judgment; or (2) by
              removing the stereotype from one's responses after the stereotype has been
              activated. Both approaches can be better understood by a more general
              consideration of how goals determine reactions to members of a stereotyped
              group. This research focuses specifically on how stereotype activation can be
              controlled, examining the mechanisms that produce such control. It is posited
              that stereotype activation is controllable through preconsciously activated
              goals, and a series of experiments examine this hypothesis. The long-term goal
              is to better understand the dynamics of social stereotypes and prejudice.
