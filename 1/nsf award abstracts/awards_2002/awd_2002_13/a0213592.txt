Abstract    :
              This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research by Professor Stephen P. Cramer in the Department of Chemistry
              and Uwe Bergmann, Assistant Research Scientist in the Department of Applied
              Sciences, at the University of California at Davis to develop x-ray resonance
              Raman spectroscopy (XRRS) as a tool to probe low-energy excitations.  The low
              energy transitions will involve charge transfer and d-d bands as well as
              molecular vibrations involving metal ions in protein systems.  In nickel
              enzymes, with either Fe or Ni, metal 3d to ligand (CO) pi* transitions are
              obscured by sulfur to iron excitations in Fe-S clusters.  In photosystem-II, Mn
              d-d bands can only be seen over a narrow spectroscopic window above the
              chlorophyl cutoff and below water near infrared bands.  The development of XRRS
              as applied to protein systems will enable the observation of metal-centered
              transitions that are obscured by other chromophores, which could help to
              characterize some of the poorly understood, but important, intermediates in
              Fe-Ni dehydrogenase,  carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, photosystem-II and other
              important Mn and Ni enzymes that are essential to understanding fundamental
              biological processes.

A new x-ray spectroscopic technique will be developed
              to probe active sites in important protein centers.
