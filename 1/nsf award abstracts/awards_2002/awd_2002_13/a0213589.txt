Abstract    :
              Professor Nathan Lewis of the California Institute of Technology is funded by
              the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program for studies leading to better
              control of the electrical and physical properties of silicon-based materials
              and devices through an emphasis on silicon surface chemistry.  The projects
              include chemical and electrical passivation reactions on single crystal silicon
              surfaces, charge transport behavior of structures obtained from mesoporous
              silicon photoelectrodes, as well as characterization of silicon-based nanotubes
              and nanospheres, and formation of organic/inorganic composites. 

Chemical
              modification of silicon surfaces is important in interfacing molecular
              electronics to semiconductor-based circuitry and developing chemical sensors,
              optoelectronic devices and photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical cells. 
              Perhaps surface modification can fool inexpensive polycrystalline silicon
              samples into having electrical and physical properties of the more expensive
              large single crystals currently used.
