Abstract    :
              Professor Marjorie Langell of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln is funded by
              the  Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study adsorbates on transition
              metal oxide surfaces.  Professor Langell proposes to utilize well-characterized
              stepped surfaces to extend her previous work.  The effects of cation valence
              and coordination on surface composition and reactivity will be probed.  Xenon
              and water adsorption on stepped NiO surfaces are probed, for example, utilizing
              high resolution electron energy loss, x-ray photoemission, auger electron and
              thermal desorption spectroscopy.  

Oxides are important industrial materials
              whose chemical properties are governed by the presence of defects. For example,
              iron oxides are important as catalysts in remediation of chlorocarbons and
              remediation in the environment.   It is a challenge to prepare well-defined
              defect properties in order to correlate electronic and geometric structure with
              reactivity.  Understanding these surface reactions will aid in the development
              of more efficient and environmentally friendly catalysis for industrial
              processes.
