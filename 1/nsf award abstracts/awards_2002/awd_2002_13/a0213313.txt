Abstract    :
              
In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Heaven will conduct research in the field of elementary
              reaction dynamics to investigate how long-range interaction forces between
              reactants influence the reaction probability and the partitioning of the energy
              between the products.  High-resolution spectroscopy will be used to map out the
              long-range potentials for select reaction pairs and associated van der Waals
              complexes.  The project includes a study of the effects of reactant orientation
              on the unimolecular decay dynamics and the solvation of open-shell
              species.

This project deals with fundamental issues of molecular reaction
              dynamics, i.e., how molecules react with one another in time and as function of
              separation.  Experiments will be performed on select prototype systems to
              obtain data that will assist in the development of advanced theoretical models
              that describe reaction chemistry.  The work is done in collaboration with
              theorists.  Students and postdoctoral research associates participate in this
              research and thereby obtain knowledge and skills that prepare them for
              employment in industry, government laboratories or academia.
