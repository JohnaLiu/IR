Abstract    :
              The investigators would host a two-day workshop of 20 leaders in geoscience
              education, learning sciences, and the application of learning science to STEM
              disciplines.  The goals of the workshop are to define the compelling research
              issues about learning in the geosciences, discuss avenues for disseminating
              existing research on learning, and initiate broad-based planning and
              coordination of activities.  The participants in the workshop will discuss
              classroom experiences that are believed to be critical barriers to learning,
              define existing research that is applicable to learning geosciences, define new
              work on learning in the geosciences, and agree on specific steps.  The meeting
              will produce a report with recommendations for disseminating research on
              learning.  

This workshop is believed to be the first step in a series of
              activities to integrate research on learning into undergraduate geoscience
              education.
