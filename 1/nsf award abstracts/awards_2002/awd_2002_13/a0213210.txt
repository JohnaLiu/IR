Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project addresses the
              development of Innovative Ultra-Broadband Ferrite Circulators/Isolators
              providing a transmission bandwidth broader than a 10:1 frequency ratio. A
              traditional circulator junction utilizing a single ferrite material results in
              a 3:1 bandwidth. A non-traditional stripline junction circulator for which the
              transmission band extends from 1.6 to 16 GHz has been designed and fabricated.
              This circulator design involves 3 different kinds of ferrite materials to be
              packed as tiles to form a composite junction. Even broader bandwidth has also
              been theoretically predicted, if more ferrite materials are used to compose the
              junction, rendering a bandwidth covering from 1 to 20 GHz. Researches on
              broadband transformer circuits are thus proposed, allowing for 50 S impedance
              to be realized with the input/output ports accompanying the operation of the
              broadband circulator/isolator junctions.

The proposed innovative
              circulators/isolators can be used as universal instruments under broadband
              considerations. For example, it can be used in measurements requiring interband
              operation, such as encountered in a Network Analyzer performing scattering
              parameter measurements. In radiometry applications it allows for narrow-width
              electromagnetic pulses to
be used with monostatic radars. Multiple radars
              operating at distinctive frequency bands can be combined to share a common
              antenna aperture so as to reduce overall radar cross section.
