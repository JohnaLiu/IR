Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to
              refine the novel Gene Engine  Technology foruse in  effective and inexpensive
              genomic analysis. The specific objectives of this project are  to 
              experimentally determine the actual limits of applicability of the Gene Engine
              TM technology and to develop all components needed for its use in
              high-resolution genomic mapping. To accomplish this, fluorescent
              sequence-specific tags will be designed and methodsdeveloped for their
              attachment to DNA targets. Microfluidic system will be improved to reliably
              stretch long DNA fragments. Algorithms needed for data processing and DNA map
              building will be developed. During the Phase I study,  mixture of DNA fragments
              up to 200 kilobases long will be analyzed. Further development will lead to
              design and commercialization of an instrument capable of analyzing genomes up
              to 10 megabases in length.

The commercial applications of this project will
              be for rapid screening of populations as well as for personalized genetic
              analysis in clinical settings in the form of routine laboratory tests.
