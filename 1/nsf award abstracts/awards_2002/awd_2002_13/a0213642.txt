Abstract    :
              	This project will evaluate a class based approach to the explanation of the
              growth in earnings inequality over the last two decades.   It adopts a class
              schema derived from the work of Erikson, Goldthorpe, and Portacarero (EGP) to
              describe the relationships between class and growing inequality.  It will
              utilize data from the Survey of Consumer Finances to evaluate the role of
              capital income in explaining the variable relationship between class position
              and income.  And it will analyze inter-industry wage differentials by class to
              examine a rent-based explanation to growing inequality: whether some of the
              growing inequality may be attributed to declines in rent payments to
              working-class wage earners in industries that have historically paid higher
              wages.
