Abstract    :
              A diagnostic laser system including a Nd: YAG pulsed laser with injection
              seeder, a pumped dye laser a spectrometer, and an ICCD camera is acquired.  The
              system will be used for Raman spectroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF),
              laser-induced incandescence (LII), and molecular filtered Rayleigh scattering
              (FRS).  These diagnostics will be employed in an investigation of the use of
              external electric fields during flame synthesis of nonagglomerated nanopowders
              and fullesrenic nanostructures.  The equipment will also be incorporated into
              new curricula on nanomaterials and advanced equipmental methods.
