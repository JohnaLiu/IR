Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University
              of Colorado, The Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal Materoals Reserach Center,
              focuses on basic liquid crystal and soft materials science that may result in
              enhanced capabilities for electro-optic, nonlinear optic, chemical and other
              applications. The Center consists of a single interdisciplinary research group
              (IRG) working on three major themes: molecularstructure/macroscopic properties,
              interfaces, and polymers/gels. Each theme integrates molecular modeling and
              design, synthesis, physical characterization, and applications development. The
              MRSEC maintains shared facilities in support of its research and for the
              training of students. The Center carries out a comprehensive education and
              outreach program that includes outreach to K-12 students and teachers by
              bringing materials topics to the classroom, summer research experiences for
              undergraduates, and a graduate program in liquid crystal science and
              technology.  The MRSEC has strong interactions with the industrial sector
              through research collaborations involving faculty and students.

Participants
              in the Center currently include 9 senior investigators, 1 postdoctoral
              associate, 12 graduate students, and 4 support personnel.   Professor Noel A.
              Clark directs the MRSEC.
