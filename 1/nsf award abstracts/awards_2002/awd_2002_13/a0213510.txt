Abstract    :
              This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research by Guy Bertrand, University of California at Riverside, on
              the synthesis and characterization of boron-phosphorus compounds with unusual
              bonding and electronic states. This class of compounds consist of a
              four-membered ring with alternating boron and phosphorus atoms. By judicious
              substitution on the boron and phosphorus atoms, the electronic ground state can
              be "tuned" along a continuum from a sigma-bonded system to singlet or triplet
              diradicals. The structure, bonding and reactivity of these unusual
              boron-phosphorus molecules will be studied. Related classes of compounds such
              as aluminum-phosphorus or aluminum-nitrogen systems will also be explored.
              

Fundamental questions of bonding and electronic structure will be
              addresssed by this study. Possible long-term applications include polymers with
              unique magnetic properties. This research will also promote collaborative
              research and the exchange of undergraduates, graduates and postdoctoral fellows
              between UC Riverside and several French universities.
