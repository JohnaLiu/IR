Abstract    :
              The University of Alaska has a collection of oral history recordings, made over
              several decades, of Native
American (Inuit and Athabaskan) individuals. 
              Although prototypes of Web access to such collections exist,
research is
              needed to explore the opinions and preferences of the native communities to the
              wider distribution of these materials.  This project will explore how they
              would like to see the Web used to benefit them, what use they can make of
              online access to the materials, and what kinds of improvements in interfaces
              and in policy would best suit the communities.  The project involves both
              design of computer systems and travel and interviewing the communities.  It
              will result in knowledge that may help ameliorate the "digital divide" between
              the majority US society and the generally poorer Native American communities,
              as well as presenting challenges to computer science research to learn how to
              build systems that support the policies needed by these communities.
