Abstract    :
              This MRSEC at Pennsylvania State University is entitled "Center for
              Nanomolecular Structures" and supports three interdisciplinary research groups
              (IRGs).  Molecular Nanofabrication (IRG 1) combines self-assembly to advance
              nanolithography along several areas of emphasis.  The aim is to bridge the gap
              between the scale of single molecules and the much larger scale defined by
              conventional lithography. 
Molecular Motors (IRG 2) has as its goal to advance
              the understanding of fundamental issues of molecular motion and to develop
              techniques to exploit such motors in nanoassembly and nanoscale motion.  Both
              synthetic and hybrid biological motors are investigated.   IRG 3 entitled
              Collective Phenomena in Restricted Geometries explores the collective
              molecular, photonic and electronic effects in systems with reduced
              dimensionalitiy.  In addition to obtaining fundamental insights into the
              effects of reduced dimensionalities the work has potential applications for
              novel photonic and ferroelectric devices.  The Center will partner with the
              Penn State node of the National Nanofabrication Users Network to create a
              national resource in the extension of nanolithography in the areas of chemical
              self-assembly.  

The Center's has education activities ranging from the
              graduate to the undergraduate and to K-12 teachers and students.  The Center
              will also acquaint the general public with the Franklin Institute Science
              Museum in Philadelphia and the Exploratorium in San Francisco.  An interactive
              exhibit in the area of nanotechnology is planned with each museum.  

The
              Center's participants include 34 faculty, 6 postdoctoral associates, 12
              graduate students, and support for undergraduates and K-12 teachers.  
              Professor Moses Chan directs the MRSEC.
