Abstract    :
              	This research will investigate the residential and occupational integration of
              European immigrants and migrant Southern blacks in New York and Chicago between
              1880 and 1920.  Previous research has analyzed these questions using samples
              from individual Census data in 1900 and 1920.   The availability of a 100%
              sample of the 1880 Census makes possible linkages back to an era when
              immigration from West Europe was at its height and immigration from Southern
              and Eastern Europe was just beginning.  The 1880 data will enable answers to
              such questions as whether the greater  integration in 1900 of the first
              immigrant groups (e.g., Germans and Irish) over more recent immigrants (e.g.,
              Italians and Russians) was because of their longer history of assimilation or
              because they were never as segregated in the first place.  Matching 1920
              individuals and families back to 1880 greatly enhances the ability to study
              inter-generational mobility and to distinguish 3rd and 4+ generation Americans
              who have been previously classified together as "native whites".
