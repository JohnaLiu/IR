Abstract    :
              The process industry (chemical, petroleum and pharmaceutical) in the United
              States has been one of the strongest industrial sectors of the economy,
              producing a consistent positive balance of trade.  This has been due to the
              cost effectiveness of its processes as well as to its technological
              innovations.  In the 21st century the process industry faces three major
              challenges: increased competition in the global marketplace, pressure for
              keeping operating costs and product prices low, and pressure to reduce
              environmental, safety and security risks.  Given these competitive concerns,
              there is an increasing focus for optimizing and integrating the supply chain in
              order to achieve reduced costs and a tighter level of coordination in the
              operations of manufacturing facilities.  One component for accomplishing these
              objectives is new process operations methodologies and tools.

This grant is
              to provide support for the conference on Foundations of Computer Aided Process
              Operations (FOCAPO) that will take place on January 12-15, 2003, in Coral
              Springs, Florida.  The meeting will focus on the areas of supply chain
              management, R&D for pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, methodologies
              for process operations (hybrid systems, data reconciliation, safety), and
              optimization models and algorithms (discrete, stochastic and dynamic).  It will
              also provide a forum to discuss supply chain software from vendors, and
              industrial and academic collaborations in the area of process operations. 
              FOCAPO 2003 aims to attract about 150 participants, with roughly equal
              representation from academia and industry.  There will also be substantial
              international participation.  One important goal is to ensure the participation
              of 20 graduate students.  The grant will support invited academic speakers and
              panelists and the graduate students.
