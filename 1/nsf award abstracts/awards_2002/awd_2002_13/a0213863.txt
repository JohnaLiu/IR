Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project objective is to
              research and develop the next generation of ultrasound real-time volumetric
              imagers, with enhanced spatial resolution and picture definition. The
              innovation is based on LEEOAT Company's patented micromachining technology and
              its expertise in parallel high-density electronic interconnections to innovate
              the Ultrasound-on-a-Chip (UOC) device. In phase I of the SBIR program, LEEOAT
              Company will design the device and demonstrate the fabrication feasibility of
              the crucial components, thus demonstrating the proof-of-concept of the UOC
              imaging system. Additionally, LEEOAT Company will theoretically simulate the
              UOC device and the support electronics for performance optimization and to
              predict the anticipated final performance of the imager. Finally, the
              cost/effort will be estimated for the final development, fabrication and
              testing of the UOC imaging system prototype for medical applications.

The
              major commercial application involves ultrasonic noninvasive medical imaging.
              Industrial applications include non-destructive evaluations such as defect
              identification in integrated circuits.
