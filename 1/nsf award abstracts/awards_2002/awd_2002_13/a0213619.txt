Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop a
              novel positron source based on the generation of free 13 N produced via the 12
              C(d,n) 13 N reaction. In a major advance over existing technologies, the 13 N
              will be extracted as nitrogen gas from a porous carbon target, fed to a remote
              location, and condensed onto a small diameter spot. A layer of solid Ne will
              moderate the 13 N beta-particles to produce a beam of slow positrons. This
              approach will yield an unrivaled brightness and two orders of magnitude higher
              intensity than current 22 Na sources, thus opening the door to many valuable
              uses of positron probes for science and industry.

The high intensity, high
              brightness positron source to be developed will have many applications to
              high-data-rate, positron micro-beam instruments for use in determining such
              things as: (1) the effects of radiation damage due to ion implantation on the
              conduction characteristics of IC semiconductors; (2) the effects of
              electro-migration on the failure of current carrying leads in ICs; (3) the
              properties of low-k dielectrics used in high speed ICs; and (4) the aging of
              the mechanical properties of plastic films.
