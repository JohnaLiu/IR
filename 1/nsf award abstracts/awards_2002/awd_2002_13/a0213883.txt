Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University
              of Southern Mississippi supports an interdisciplinary research program in the
              area of polymer coatings and films. The Center also supports a wide range of
              educational activities, including the establishment of advanced degrees in
              polymer education and a new course leading to an advanced degree in Distance
              Leaming. The Center is entitled the Response-Driven Polymeric Films Center. The
              Center supports well maintained and accessible shared experimental facilities
              and interacts with industry and other sectors at local, regional, national and
              international levels. 

The Center's research is organized into two
              interdisciplinary research groups (IRGS). 
IRG 1, Design and Synthesis
              ofresponse -Driven Poymers, focuses on the the design and synthesis of
              molecular processes in biomaterials, liquid crystals, and environmentally
              fismart" molecules. IRG 2, Response-Driven Film Formation, conducts molecular
              level investigations of films and coatings that exhibit response-driven
              properties. Potential application of the Center's research are in diveres areas
              such as water treatment, controlled drug release, and formulation of
              water-based coatings.. In addition, seed support is provided for emerging
              research opportunities which are within the general scope of the Center.
              

Participants in the Center currently include 19 senior investigators, 2
              postdoctoral associates, 30 graduate students, 12 undergraduates, and 6
              technicians and other support personnel. Professor Marek W. Urban directs the
              MRSEC.
