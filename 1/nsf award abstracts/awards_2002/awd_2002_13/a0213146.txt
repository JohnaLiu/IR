Abstract    :
              The symposium (scheduled for the SICB meeting in Toronto, January 4-8, 2003) has
              a number of related goals.  It shall honor Peter W. Hochachka for his numerous,
              pioneering and decades-long contributions to the study of biochemical
              adaptation to the environment.  The symposium shall feature historical
              perspectives and the latest developments in areas encompassed by the field of
              biochemical adaptation to the environment.  It shall provide zoologists an
              overview of how, over the past 30 years, the field of adaptational biochemistry
              has grown from an infant, highly speculative field into one that continues to
              be fascinating and dynamic, but is now mature, sophisticated, and highly
              influential.  The symposium shall demonstrate that the August Krogh Principle
              (choosing the species best suited to the scientific question of interest) is
              alive and well and illustrate the broad range of techniques including nmr
              spectroscopy, molecular biology, and comparative phylogenetic approaches, used
              in studies of biochemical adaptation.  The symposium shall illustrate how
              tightly interwoven this discipline has become with various subdisciplines in
              ecology and evolutionary biology, i.e., that it has become one with the rest of
              the biological sciences.  The symposium shall have 10 speakers who will each
              give 30 minute presentations. Their lectures shall be written up for
              publication in American Zoologist.
