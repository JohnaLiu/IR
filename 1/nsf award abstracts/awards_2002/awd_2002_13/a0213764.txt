Abstract    :
              FPC (FingerPrinted Contigs) is a software package to aid scientists in building
              a physical map of a region, chromosome or whole genome.  Along with many
              smaller projects, it has been used for building sequence-ready maps for human,
              plants, and fruit flies.  A recent function has been added to evaluate and add
              electronic markers to the map.  A second function is the ability to do a
              simulated digestion of a sequenced clone so that the theoretic fingerprint can
              be incorporated for completeness.  Trait data for microarray experiments is
              also being added.  In the current activity, a new interface will be designed to
              enable users to mine and control the data.  The implementation of a new
              algorithm for finding the minimal tiling path for make a sequence-ready map is
              also planned. Since many plant genomes will have only draft sequence, it is
              important to have tools that can use this data to develop a minimal tiling
              path.  This and the ability to assign clones and genetic markers to a map will
              help to anchor contigs based on any give framework map.  The tools are
              available online.  Students and research professionals are responsible for the
              development.
