The domestic dog is without question the most diverse species
              with regard to size and conformation. Further, many conformation traits are
              fixed in breeds and it is argued that these traits may often have a simple
              genetic basis. Therefore, the dog is a good model for identification of genes
              that have a consequential effect on skeletal development. A novel experimental
              design is presented that aims to uncover specific genes that influence
              conformation, coat color and behavior. The design utilizes a case controlled
              approach in which breed that share similar traits are scanned with 540
              framework markers. Regions of the genome that have low variability in a subset
              of markers are likely to contain genes that have been the object of selection
              in breeds. Statistical and molecular tools are defined that will allow
              fine-scale mapping and eventual identification of major genes influencing
              traits. To demonstrate the viability of the approach, three small studies are
              proposed: 1) a genomic scan of 20 breeds thought to be inbred to demonstrate
              they have sufficient variation for our experimental design; 2) a genomic scan
              of three breeds sharing the achondroplasia phenotype (short legged dogs) to
              show that the gene for this trait can be identified; and 3) determination of
              the extent of homozygosity signal in regions flanking a gene known to cause a
              coat color phenotype in one breed.  

This project will test the feasibility
              of a new approach to discover genes that have consequential effects on size and
              conformation. Further, the footprint that intense selection leaves in the
              genome will be determined. This may enable new approaches for gene mapping and
              provide a better understanding of skeletal development and evolution.
