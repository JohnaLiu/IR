Abstract    :
              Tropical rainforests in the Amazon Basin and elsewhere are experiencing stronger
              droughts as El Nino episodes become more frequent and more severe.  How will
              this drying trend affect these species-rich tropical ecosystems?  We initiated
              the world's first large-scale rainfall manipulation experiment in a tropical
              rainforest in 1998, partially excluding rainfall from a one-hectare forest area
              in central Amazonia.  We discovered that the growth of tree trunks is very
              sensitive to drought, as is forest flammability.  During the next five years,
              we will determine the level of drought stress that this rainforest can tolerate
              before tree flowering and fruiting begin to fail, and large trees begin to die.
               We will then release the forest from experimental drought to document the
              mechanisms and rates of forest recovery.  It is already clear that drought
              effects on tree growth and tree mortality may contribute substantially to the
              carbon dioxide concentration of the atmosphere.
