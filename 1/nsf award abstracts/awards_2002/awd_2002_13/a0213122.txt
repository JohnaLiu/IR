Abstract    :
              This project addresses a fundamental question of brain evolution:  how well
              conserved is the main brain circuit diagram across the vertebrates? 
              Specifically, this project aims to resolve contradicting predictions arising
              from two recent lines of research into a structure called the basal ganglia,
              which is important in initiating and learning complex behaviors.  One set of
              work, primarily on traditionally studied bird species such as pigeons and
              chickens, has shown close similarities between birds and mammals.  Another line
              of work, using the specific brain structures of songbirds, which learn their
              vocalizations, has found some key differences in how the basal ganglia circuits
              are organized.  Work proposed here will determine how portions of the chicken
              basal ganglia are wired, and how individual nerve cells in those structures
              work.  Emphasis will be on how similar or different the structure and function
              of these brain regions are between birds and mammals.  Data gathered through
              this sort of comparative research has two major beneficial effects:  they shed
              light on how brains have evolved; and they provide information on how different
              species have solved problems in similar or different ways.
