Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result in an
              innovative, technologically advanced, imaging system-with the potential of
              counting of individual photons. The imaging system will be a compact
              avalanche-gain, charge-coupled device, and digital camera. The innovation will
              offer high photo-response from the deep ultraviolet to the near infrared in
              very Low Light Level, as well as photonic light conditions. In addition, the
              Photon Counting Camera will present solid-state reliability without typical
              intensifier imaging tube limitations, such as, image burn-in and blooming. A
              possible research, military, law enforcement, or "home land security"
              application for the Photon Counting Camera will be "black-on-black" detection
              that is when faint objects are difficult to discriminate from the background.
              

This far-reaching technology will also be beneficial for many non-military
              applications, such as astronomy, bio- and chemical-luminescence, microscopy,
              and beam imaging. Furthermore, the innovation will offer significant cost
              savings and enhance multi-spectral imaging performance, compared to
              conventional intensifier imaging systems. In short, the Photon Counting Camera
              will have the most impact where MHz readout speeds (real-time or TV speeds) and
              lowest possible noise are required.
