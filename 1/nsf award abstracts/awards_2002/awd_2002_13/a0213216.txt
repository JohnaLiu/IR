Abstract    :
              The research is focused in two connected directions.  First, new carbonylative
              carbotricyclizations and related reactions will be developed.  The method
              provides an efficient method for the production of fused polycyclic systems. 
              Second, enantioselective and regioselective hydrocarbonylation reactions will
              be carried out with fluorous catalysis using fluorinated solvents and with
              fluorous catalysis using supercritical carbon dioxide.  The prospects are high
              for developing methodology wherein catalyst recovery and reuse are possible,
              thereby leading to practical green chemistry. 

With this award, the Organic
              and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research efforts of Dr.
              Iwao Ojima of the Department of Chemistry at SUNY, Stony Brook.  Professor
              Ojima will focus his work on developing methodology to affect carbocyclization
              and carbonylation reactions.  He will also develop green chemistry in catalytic
              organic synthesis promoted by transition metal catalysts.  The research has
              broader impact for the training of students and for use in the pharmaceutical
              and agricultural industries.  Collaboration between academia and industry are
              already in place.
