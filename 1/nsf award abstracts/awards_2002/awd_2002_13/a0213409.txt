Abstract    :
              Various fallacies in thinking interfere with judgment about
matters of tax.  In
              particular, people may oppose or
inconsistently support optimizing reforms ---
              or favor reforms
that are less than optimal --- because of three clusters
              of
cognitive biases.  One, the status-quo effect, leads people to
resist
              beneficial change: they are apt to weigh perceived losses
more than foregone
              gains.  Two, manipulation of the point of
comparison affects how people
              perceive the advantages and
disadvantages of reform proposals. Three, people
              underestimate or
ignore various "unseen" elements of fiscal policy, such
              as
imputed income and the incentive effects or opportunity costs of
various
              tax and transfer programs.

We shall explore these effects in a series of
              experiments, some
conducted on the World Wide Web and others conducted with
              other
samples.  We shall examine these effects in a wide range of
realistic
              tax reform proposals, e.g., those concerned with taxes
on married couples,
              hidden taxes, payroll taxes, consumption
taxes, taxes on imputed income,
              pollution taxes, and taxes that
substitute for private expenditures (such as
              those that pay for
health care).  Finally, we shall attempt to "debias" the
              effects
of interest, and explore the transfer of training from one domain
to
              another (in part by using samples of people who have already
been trained in
              the economic theory of taxes).
