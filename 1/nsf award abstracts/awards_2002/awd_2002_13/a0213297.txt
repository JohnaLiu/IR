Abstract    :
              Michael J Shaw of the Southern Illinois University (a primarily undergraduate
              institution) is supported the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic
              Chemistry Program for investigation of the factors that influence
              metal-mediated reactions that produce heterocyclic aromatic compounds from
              alkynes. A variety of d6-metal complexes involving acetylenic ketones and
              esters (including a variety of spectroscopic labels) will be synthesized. These
              will be used to probe a number of aspects of the reactions of interest. The
              main part of the research will be spectro-electrochemical investigations and
              surface normalized incident Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
              (SNIFTIRS). These powerful techniques will be used to detect and characterize
              reaction intermediates with life-times of a few seconds or less.

The type of
              process that is of principal interest in this program is widely used for
              practical purposes, but the detailed course of the reaction is not well
              understood. The powerful combination of experimental techniques that this study
              will bring to bear on the process will greatly facilitate understanding the
              intermediate steps in the reaction sequence, leading to improved effectiveness
              of the transformation. This project will also provide an exceptional vehicle
              for introducing undergraduate students to research, using a variety of
              sophisticated, but well-tested and experimentally tractable methodologies.
              Success in this project will have impact both on the technological use of
              organometallic transformations, but also on the educational development of a
              number of students, some training to be future science teachers.
