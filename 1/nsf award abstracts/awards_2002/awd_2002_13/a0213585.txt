Abstract    :
              Determining the fate of CO2 has important consequences to the environment.
              Forests, particularly in the wet tropics may be very large carbon sinks. Recent
              evidence suggests that the Amazon may be a net sink of atmospheric CO2, storing
               1-9 Mg C / ha/ yr. This project seeks to understand the role of CO2
              outgassing, or evasion, from the Amazon River system in the carbon cycle of
              this important mosit tropical forest ecosystem. The working hypothesis of this
              research is that CO2 evasion returns as much carbon to the atmosphere as is
              sequestered in upland forests on an interannual basis. Export of organic
              material from upland forests to fluvial environments is the primary source of
              carbon that is eventually respired in rivers and evaded as CO2. The field work
              associated with this project will samplecharacteristic sub-basins of the Amazon
              to determine the spatial and temporal variation in CO emission. The 3-year
              project will be a joint effort between researchers at the University of
              Washington and the Centro de Energia Nuclear na Agricultura and will model
              whole ecosystem carbon flux of the Amazon River system.
