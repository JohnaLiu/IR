Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of synthetic methodology using the
              allenic Pauson-Khand reaction to prepare cross-conjugated trienes via a formal
              Alder-ene reaction.  The scope of the reaction will be determined and the
              resulting information will be used to guide the synthesis of complex molecules
              having interesting biological properties.  The research will also lead to a
              better understanding of transition metal catalyzed carbon-carbon bond forming
              reactions.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              is supporting the research of Dr. Kay M. Brummond of the Department of
              Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh.  Professor Brummond will focus her
              efforts on the use of transition metals for the development of new strategies
              for the construction of molecularly complex and biologically relevant
              compounds.  Carbon-carbon bond forming reactions with an emphasis on the allene
              functional group will be emphasized. The methodology has potential impact for
              the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries and the project is an excellent
              vehicle for the training of graduate students.
