Sensitization is a simple form of learning in which
              an animal's responses to environmental stimuli are enhanced.  This form of
              behavioral plasticity is important because it contributes to processes of
              attention and arousal, as well as to more complex forms of learning such as
              classical (i.e. Pavlovian) conditioning.  Typically, sensitization is induced
              by the delivery of a particularly strong or salient stimulus.   This stimulus
              activates neurons that release modulatory neurotranmitters, which alter the
              neural circuit mediating the test behavior.  Because the modulatory neurons are
              distinct from the neurons that mediate the test behavior, this process is
              referred to as extrinsic sensitization.  However, there are many examples where
              sensitization is induced by a stimulus that is similar or identical to the
              stimulus that elicits the test behavior.  In such situations, modulatory
              neurotransmitters are released by neurons within the circuit that mediates the
              test behavior.  This is referred to as intrinsic or wind-up sensitization. 
              
Using the medicinal leech, the distinct physiological and cellular mechanisms
              of intrinsic and extrinsic sensitization will be examined.  These experiments
              will combine electrophysiological recordings from single neurons with
              simultaneous monitoring of sensitization-induced changes in a defensive
              withdrawal reflex (shortening).  Both forms of sensitization are observed in
              the leech shortening reflex and the leech nervous system is extremely well
              characterized, making it possible to record from single, identifiable neurons
              that are known to mediate this behavior.
