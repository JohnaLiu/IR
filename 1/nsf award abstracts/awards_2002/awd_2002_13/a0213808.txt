Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University
              of Nebraska supports an interdisciplinary research program on Quantum and Spin
              Phenomena in Nanomagnetic Structures. The MRSEC includes faculty participants
              representing the departments of physics, mechanical engineering, chemistry, and
              the school of biological sciences The Center's research is organized into two
              interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs).  IRG1, Nanomagnetism: Fundamental
              Interactions and Applications, is concerned with the study of exchange and
              magnetostatic interactions between particles or grains in nanostructures.  IRG
              2, Spin Polarization and Transmission at Nanocontacts and Interfaces,
              investigates spin polarization and transport through nanoscale magnetic
              contacts and at ferromagnetic/ferroelectric structures. The Center's research
              is aided by extensive collaborations with other universities, government and
              industrial laboratories that bring in over fifteen additional participants. 
              The Center also maintains shared experimental facilities in support of its
              research efforts. Education outreach efforts include research experiences for
              teachers and for faculty-student teams from predominantly undergraduate
              institutions.

Participants in the Center currently include 16 senior
              investigators, 2 postdoctoral associates, 14 graduate students, 10
              undergraduate students, and 2 support personnel.   Professor David J. Sellmyer
              directs the MRSEC.
