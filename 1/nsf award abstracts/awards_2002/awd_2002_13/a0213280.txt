Title:	GOALI - Characterization
              of Dense Colloidal Suspensions with FDPM

In this project, the PI proposes to
              (i) develop and test new inverse algorithms for assessing particle size and
              size distribution in monodisperse, binary, and polydisperse suspensions from
              experimental multi-wavelength FDPM data, (ii) assess changes in FDPM measured
              scattering properties arising from depletion force, electrostatic interactions,
              and colloids functionalized with ligand receptor systems of biological
              significance; and (iii) evaluate those changes in the context of first
              principles models of partial structure factor.  The final objective of the
              GOALI project is to develop a low cost, simple diagnostics tool in characterize
              the interaction between colloidal particles in dense suspensions.  Extension of
              the system to on-line characterization of intermediate and final colloidal
              products is planned for chemical, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology
              industries.
