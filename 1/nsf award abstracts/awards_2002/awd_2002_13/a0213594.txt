Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to 
              develop a novel low-voltage periodic poling technique for creating highly
              efficient quasi-phase matched waveguides in nonlinear optical materials. The
              key innovation of the proposed  technology is the use of co-planar micro-comb
              electrodes to periodically pole waveguides embedded in a nonlinear optical
              material such as potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP). Periodically poled
              waveguides will enable highly efficient, quasi-phase matched (QPM), nonlinear
              optical frequency conversion of continuous wave and low peak power
              quasi-continuous radiation. The proposed technique will allow multiple
              waveguides with different QPM gratings to be fabricated onto a single device,
              thereby building in wavelength flexibility as well as reducing cost. The
              anticipated benefits of low-voltage poling are waveguides with significantly
              improved conversion efficiency, low scattering loss, and increased
              manufacturing yields.

The commercial applications of this project are in the
              areas of bioanalytical instrumentation (such as medical diagnostics, flow
              cytometers and medical imagers) and  telecommunications.
