Abstract    :
              Professor Rotello and co-workers will initially study the effects of redox
              switching on the molecular recognition properties of a number of small
              molecules (imide-diaminopyridine dyads).  They will use EPR, NMR, and density
              functional computational methods to determine the factors that control the
              efficiency of redox modulated molecular recognition processes.  They will then
              apply redox modulated recognition process to the controlled formation of
              supramolecular polymers and polymer networks.  This polymer work will involve
              development of redox active cross linkers for use in electronically controlled
              cross linking processes and redox controlled polymerization, both at surfaces
              and in solution.    

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Vincent M. Rotello of the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.  Dr.
              Rotello and his students will work on the development of small molecules which
              can be electrically induced to change their recognition and polymerization
              properties.  The goal is to prepare materials which can be manipulated to
              change binding partners electronically or change oligomerization/polymerization
              state electronically.  The organic based molecular devices developed will have
              the potential to function as information storage/switching systems in computers
              or sensors.  Students trained during the course of this interdisciplinary work
              will gain skills needed by the pharmaceutical, polymer and speciality chemicals
              industries.
