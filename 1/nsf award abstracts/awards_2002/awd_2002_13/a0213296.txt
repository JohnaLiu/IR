Abstract    :
              Many economic problems are naturally modeled as coordination problems.  
              Speculators in financial markets may have an incentive to attack a currency
              only if they believe that others will do so. Depositors in a bank may have an
              incentive to withdraw their money only if they think that others will do so. 
              In such settings, informal commentary points to  "confidence" and
              "self-fulfilling expectations" as determinants of the outcome, but there is
              still no consensus on the corresponding theory to flesh out these
              explanations.

The purpose of this project is to fund the participation of
              U.S. researchers in an international conference that brings together theorists
              and experimental economists who have been studying these issues. The conference
              will be held in Barcelona, Spain on August 17-19, 2002 in the campus of Pompeu
              Fabra University. The time is ripe is for such a conference.  There has been
              rapid theoretical progress in the modeling of coordination with incomplete
              information.  However, there is no consensus on whether the predictions of the
              new theories are of practical relevance.  There is a well-developed
              experimental literature on coordination games.  These literatures have
              developed independently and the two groups of researchers have much to learn
              from each other.
