Abstract    :
              This project studies how, and to what extent, property relations in contemporary
              rural China have been and are being restructured through the examination of
              land litigation, an arena in which the ownership of agricultural property has
              been redefined, negotiated, and contested among interest groups including the
              socialist state, the village collective, and individual households.  This
              research combines an analysis of power mechanism with consideration of the
              cultural dimensions of property and law in China.  Fieldwork will be conducted
              in Huangnihe, a rural township in southwestern China.  The social histories of
              local land cases will be traced through participant observation and discourse
              analysis.  This project will be conducted at a time in China when rural
              households and collectives are enjoying the widest latitude in land management
              since the 1950s.  By exploring land ownership from the specific perspective of
              legal disputes, this project will add new dimensions to the current research on
              China's rapidly changing property relations in the post-Mao era.  Moreover,
              this project will be the first anthropological study of local legal functioning
              the mainland China and it will be conducted at a time when nationwide concern
              with legal reform in most pronounced.  Unlike most of the recent work on
              China's law, which overwhelmingly focuses on the urban area, this research will
              focus on the rural area where almost 80% of China's population lives.
