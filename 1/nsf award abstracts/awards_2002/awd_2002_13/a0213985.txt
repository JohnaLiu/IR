Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University
              of Alabama investigates new materials that may lead to future information
              technologies. The Center involves interdisciplinary research by faculty
              participants from the Departments of Physics, Chemistry,  Materials and
              Metallurgical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Electrical and Computer
              Engineering. The MRSEC research is organized into two interdisciplinary
              research groups (IRGs). IRG1, Dynamics and Transport in Nanostructured Magnetic
              Materials, focuses on the synthesis, characterization, modeling and
              optimization of films of ordered, self-assembled, monodisperse, magnetic
              nanoparticles that may serve as future extremely high density magnetic
              recording media. IRG2, Dendrimer-Based Materials for Information Technology,
              investigates new dendrimer-based materials for information technology and
              evolves from a seed project that demonstrated long-term charge storage in
              special redox gradient dendrimer molecules.

The Center maintains shared
              experimental facilities in support of its research and for student training.
              The MRSEC also supports education and outreach efforts that include development
              of instructional materials for middle school students by teachers and MRSEC
              faculty, a summer research experience for teachers and undergraduates, and a
              summer research program for faculty and students from Historically Black
              Colleges and Universities.  The Center has strong interactions with the
              magnetic recording industry that inform the fundamental research done by the
              MRSEC participants of 'real wotld' contraints and needs.

Participants in the
              Center currently include 16 senior investigators, 5 postdoctoral associates, 13
              graduate students, 1 undergraduate student and 1 support personnel.   Professor
              William H. Butler directs the MRSEC.
