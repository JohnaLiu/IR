Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to
              develop an innovative intelligent optical sensor for semiconductor back-end
              processes control and inspection by using our matrix-addressable laser/detector
              array chip. The sensor will be incorporated into the fine pitch component
              placement machines, to ensure accurate component placement, and co-planarity of
              component leads and to inspect components immediately before placement. 
              Identification of defective or damage lead tips that lie within the same plane
              will be.  Additional inspection capabilities include solder bump volume and
              height, bump position and quality, ball height and diameter of ball grit array,
              ball coplanarity and foreign materials. The sensor actually is a miniature
              confocal scanning laser microscope without any moving parts. Since there are no
              moving parts or bulky optics, we are able obtain image rate at least 60 frames
              per second, and sensor can be made a very small dimension. 

This sensor will
              enable semiconductor packaging manufactures to increase operating efficiency,
              increase product yield, and add to their quality control.
