Abstract    :
              The design or reform of electoral rules has been a subject of intense debate in
              many countries all over the world. Moreover, the choice of an electoral system
              may have important economic consequences, because of the induced difference in
              terms of the elected policy-making body. In this project I compare proportional
              representation systems and majoritarian systems in terms of: (1) the number of
              effective parties; (2) the expected policies, policy variance and welfare; (3)
              corruption; (4) strategic versus sincere voting; (5) affirmative action and
              gender equality. These objectives are pursued theoretically as well as
              empirically: the representative democracy model has to allow for strategic
              party behavior, strategic voting, free entry of candidates and new parties, and
              incumbency advantages, and politicians must be allowed to have both policy
              preferences and private objectives. With all these ingredients the model
              suggests that majoritarian systems induce more policy variance, less
              corruption, and less gender equality: these and many other predictions will be
              tested on international data and on the basis of some detailed country
              studies.

The theoretical and empirical conclusions of the project can be
              important for electoral design in new democracies as well as for electoral
              reforms in established democracies. Beside the consequences of electoral
              formulas, the policy relevant conclusions of the project will involve the
              comparison of closed versus open list systems, the effectiveness and
              desirability of gender quotas, the optimal legal thresholds in proportional
              systems, and the optimal mix of public and private campaign financing.
              Moreover, the theoretical framework will probably be very useful for future
              researchers interested in other aspects of democratic policymaking.
