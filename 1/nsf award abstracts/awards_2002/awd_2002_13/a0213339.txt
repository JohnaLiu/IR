Abstract    :
              Does political structure affect political culture?  To be more specific, does a
              long period of authoritarian rule transform the attitudes, orientations and
              feelings citizens have about their political system, in particular their
              support of its constituent units?  What are the factors that can explain
              variations in mass system support, and is their relative predictive power the
              same in both the periods?  What can comparisons between the political cultures
              of newly democratizing nations tell us about the impact of authoritarianism and
              about the consolidation of democracy.

This Doctoral Dissertation Research
              Support project examines the evolution of mass political attitudes, in
              particular system support, in Chile for the periods leading up to, and
              following, 16 years of authoritarian rule (1973-1989).  The Chilean political
              system presents an ideal case for studying the link between political regime
              and political culture because of its generalizability and because the data are
              available.

Longitudinal and cross-sectional comparisons are possible because
              of the presence of an extraordinary collection of survey data, particularly
              those from Chile, archived at the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. 
              The data also include cross-national surveys carried out in the
              post-authoritarian period:  the Latinobarometro surveys 1996, 1997; the World
              Values Survey 1990, 1995; and the 1998 Hewlett Survey.  These measure citizens'
              opinions on a broad spectrum of social, economic and political subjects.  This
              projects uses the available data to test, across regimes, a wide-range of
              hypotheses that focus on factors such as ideology, party identification, trust,
              participation, live satisfaction, economic conditions, class and religion to
              explain variations in mass support for democracy.
