Abstract    :
              This research will undertake comparative ethnographic investigations of the
              homeless in Los Angeles, Paris, Sao Paulo, and Tokyo using local research
              teams.  The long range goal is to explore why homelessness emerged in each of
              these global cities at similar times in the last quarter of the twentieth
              century.  Descriptions of street life will look for similarities and
              differences across the four cities:  Who constitute the homeless: how do their
              age, gender, racial-ethnic, educational, disability, and work statuses
              distinguish them from the domiciled?  What are the survival strategies of the
              homeless?  How do they account for their homelessness?  What have been the
              political responses to the emergence of homelessness?  The research teams will
              each explore these questions in their own cities and meet for comparative
              analyses in Sao Paulo.
