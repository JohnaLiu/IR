Abstract    :
              The Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project will investigate
              interaction of the stratosphere and troposphere in context of the stratospheric
              sudden warming phenomenon.  Interest in the stratospheric circulation,
              including sudden warming, has recently been rekindled by observational analysis
              that suggests that a primary mode of tropospheric variability in polar
              latitudes - the Northern Hemisphere Annular Mode - is influenced by the
              downward migration of annular anomalies from the stratosphere.  Variations in
              stratospheric polar vortex have been linked to seasonal anomalies in the
              tropospheric zonal-mean zonal winds and circulation patterns such as the Arctic
              Oscillation/North Atlantic Oscillation.  These patterns have profound impact on
              European and North American climate and weather.  Dr. Limpasuvan will conduct a
              dynamically oriented objective analysis of the mechanisms coupling the
              troposphere and stratosphere, including wave propagation.  Diagnosis of heat
              and momentum fluxes associated with sudden warming will also be undertaken. 
              The project will advance the understanding of mechanisms responsible for
              stratosphere's influence on surface weather and climate.  The project will
              involve undergraduate students at Coastal Carolina University in an effort to
              integrate research into the school's science education, and strengthen the
              institution's new Applied Physics program.  It will provide valuable and unique
              research experience to undergraduates in South Carolina and the greater
              southeastern region.
