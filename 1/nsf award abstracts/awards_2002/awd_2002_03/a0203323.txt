 "An HCI
              Partnership Serving Underrepresented Groups"

This is a multinstitutional
              project that leverages prior and ongoing research in the area of Human Computer
              Interfaces (HCI) into new curricula. In particular, the project's focus is: (a)
              to create a Human-Computer Interaction curriculum at the University of
              Baltimore's School of Information Arts and Technologies (SIAT) that will
              actively involve early-stage graduate students in ongoing research; (b) to
              construct and deliver this curriculum so that it is maximally effective in
              attracting and graduating students from groups underrepresented in the
              sciences, especially women, African-Americans, and students from
              non-traditional age groups; (c) to structure this curriculum around the
              results, and ongoing inquiry, of research at the University of Maryland's
              Human-Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL) in the design of children's technologies;
              (d) to embed this curriculum and research in a partnership spanning SIAT, HCIL,
              and local private and public sector institutions, and (e) widely disseminate
              this partnership model, and the results of its evaluation, with the goal of
              creating further partnerships between research and comprehensive institutions
              that will result in the involvement of students from underrepresented groups in
              ongoing research. Students who participate in this project's curriculum will
              also engage in field research that prepare them to join the workforce as
              professionals who have experience with research-grounded methods of developing
              HCI technologies, particularly those that are components of the HCIL's work on
              children's educational information technologies (including contextual inquiry,
              task analysis, participatory design, low-fidelity prototyping, querying
              interfaces, and spatial interfaces).
