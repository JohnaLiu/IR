Holland's proposed work centers on applying the
              Hrushovski-style
amalgamation technique to produce novel examples of
              omega-stable
structures.  Together with Baldwin, Holland is engaged in
              an
attempt to use this technique to produce a bad field.  Holland's
work
              toward this end has produced algebro-geometric results of
independent interest
              on the relationship between transcendence
degree and multiplicative group rank
              in characteristic zero
fields.  Holland proposes to exploit this work to
              complete the
bad field project with Baldwin and to extend
              the
algebro-geometric results.  She further proposes to settle
stability
              questions for certain structures produced by the
technique; to analyze the
              geometries of structures produced by
the technique and to extend her joint
              work with Baldwin toward an
abstract model theoretic analysis of the technique
              and its
products.

Since its introduction in the early 90s,
              Hrushovski's
amalgamation technique has been applied with great success
              to
settle a variety of old existence conjectures central to
algebraic model
              theory.  Holland's ambition, embodied in this
proposal, is threefold: To
              continue breaking new ground in
application of the technique, to explore the
              limitations of the
technique by characterizing common properties of its
              products,
and to make the technique more widely and efficiently applicable
by
              extracting common difficulties arising in its implementation
and dealing with
              them uniformly on an abstract level.
