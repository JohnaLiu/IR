The focus of this project is
              the development of innovative library-quality software and under-
lying
              mathematics for dual active set techniques in optimization.The dual active set
              algorithm
(DASA)was .rst introduced in the context of state constrained
              control problems,and later in the
context of constrained mathematical
              programs.For linear or quadratic programming,each step of
the algorithm is
              equivalent to solving a linear system of equations,and in successive
              steps,there
is a small rank change in the matrix corresponding to the change
              in the active set.Numerical
experience has shown that the dual active set
              framework is an extremely e .cient approach for
solving some broad classes of
              optimization problems,including problems in optimal control and
quadratic
              network optimization.A version of the algorithm targeted to linear programming
              has
already solved some LPs that other state-of-the-art packages are unable to
              solve.We will develop
a variety of sparse matrix techniques,which have broad
              applicability,and which provide,in par-
ticular,the numerical foundation for
              DASA.Each technique will be developed into library-quality
software and made
              widely available.These include:
