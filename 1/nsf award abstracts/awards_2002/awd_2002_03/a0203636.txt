Abstract    :
              The PIs plan mapping and sampling features on the Cocos and Nazca plates to
              provide a basis for inferring the properties of the subducted Cocos plate under
              Central America.  The basic premise is that the Nazca plate south of Grijalva
              was formerly contiguous with Cocos plate under Nicaragua and parts of Costa
              Rica and that this fossil plate boundary could form an important structure in
              the down-going slab.  Because a small fragment remains unsubducted, the
              investigators propose to not only study it, but also it's conjugate off Peru,
              where much more remains.  At that locality, the structure can be mapped more
              thoroughly and the results extrapolated to the subducted slab beneath Costa
              Rica.  Further, dredging will provide essential samples to measure the
              composition of the lithosphere that is beneath the Central American arc.
