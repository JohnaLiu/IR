Resultants have many
              applications in Computational Science and Engineering.  They are a powerful
              tool for determining whether or not a system of polynomial equations have a
              common root for solving for the common roots when they exist.  Resultants  are
              currently employed to compute intersections of rational curves and surfaces, to
              solve inverse kinematics problems, and to analyze dynamic systems.  Robotics,
              Computer vision, Comptuer Graphics, Solid Modeling, and Computer Aided
              Geometric Design all utilize resultants.
