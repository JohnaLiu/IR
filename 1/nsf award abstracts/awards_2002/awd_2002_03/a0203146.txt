              and Rendering of Complex Contact States

The proposed research is concerned
              with 1) how to simulate, with high fidelity in a virtual environment, the
              effect felt by a human operator holding one or more parts during a manual
              assembly or manipulation process, and 2) how to automatically render such an
              effect in real-time so that a human in a virtual environment feels as though
              the parts are real.  The experimental and interdisciplinary nature of the
              proposed research will provide opportunities for the postdoctoral associate to
              broaden and deepen research skills and expertise in geometric and physical
              computation algorithms, human-computer interaction, mechanics of robotic
              manipulation, computer simulation, animation, teleoperation, and collaboration
              over the Internet.  Potential applications of the proposed research include
              virtual prototyping, distance learning, e-commerce, and entertainment.
