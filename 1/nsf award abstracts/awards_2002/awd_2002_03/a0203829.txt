Abstract    :
              As integrated circuit chips are becoming more complex to design, pre-fabricated
              platform chips, intended to meet the needs of a wide variety of embedded
              computing products, are becoming increasingly 
common. The trend towards
              platforms creates the need for parameterizing computing architectures such that
              platforms can have their performance and power consumption adapted to the
              different needs of different products, and that can be tuned to the particular
              compute patterns of a particular product.  This project will investigate
              several aspects of such parameterization.  It will demonstrate the feasibility
              of extensive parameterization of an architecture's memory components, key
              contributors to power and performance. It will define the basic tasks that make
              up platform-oriented CAD, partition computer-aided design (CAD) tasks between
              desktop and platform resources to yield fast yet accurate and
cost-effective
              CAD solutions, and develop new CAD exploration algorithms for desktop/platform
              co-exploration. The research will benefit platform designers, who need an
              understanding of parameters and tuning issues to  effectively build heavily
              parameterized platforms and their associated CAD tools, and platform users, who
              can utilize such platforms and CAD tools to develop more efficient
              platform-based designs than currently possible.
