Abstract    :
              This funding provides support for the Principal Investigator to sponsor a visit
              for five researchers from Latin America to the Center for Indigenous Languages
              of Latin America at the University of Texas.   The guests will participate in
              activities and a conference focusing on preserving oral indigenous languages.  
              Activities in this area are regarded by many as essential to prevent the
              disappearance of these languages and the knowledge and cultural assets they
              embody from the human record.  It has been documented that indigenous languages
              around the world are disappearing at an alarming rate.  The Digital Libraries
              Initiative is funding several projects focusing on the capture and retrieval of
              audio content and transcripts.  Having indigenous linguists present and
              involved in centers which are focusing on preservation of indigenous languages
              using digital technologies is essential to the overall success of the endeavor.
