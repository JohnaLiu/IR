Abstract    :
              EIA-0203958 Anupam Joshi University of Maryland-Baltimore County Agent Oriented
              Approaches to a Ubiquitous Grid

At the level of computing and networking
              hardware we will see dramatic changes in the next few years.  Computing will
              become pervasive.  These developments will lead to wireless networks that will
              scale all the way from ad hoc body area networks to satellite WANs, and link
              together supercomputers, "palmstations" and embededded sensors &
              controllers.

Given this scenario, our proposed research will seek to extend
              the computational grid by making it ubiquitous and pervasive.  In particular,
              we will develop agent based runtime systems where each component is autonomous,
              articulate, social and adaptive.  Such a system will seamlessly partition
              computation across elements of the grid ranging from palmtops to
              supercomputers.  Issues that we will investigate include (i) Component/Service
              Discovery, (ii) Dynamic Composition of components, and (iii) computation
              partition across highly asymmetric and heterogeneous systems.
