This three-year award for US-Spain collaboration on particle
              physics of implications of M-theory involves Mirjam Cvetic and his students of
              the University of Pennsylvania and Luis Ibanez and Angel Uranga at the
              Universidad Autonoma of Madrid, in Spain. The purpose of the project is to
              investigate the fundamental aspects of strings and branes, as well as the
              powerful applications of string theory to particle phenomenology, astrophysics,
              and cosmology.
 
The US researchers and Spanish researchers bring to this
              collaboration expertise in string model building and string phenomenology.  The
              Penn theory group has also begun to broaden the scope of string phenomenology
              to astrophysical and cosmological issues. The objectives of the joint project
              are to bring the state of the art of model building in new regimes of M theory
              to the next level.
