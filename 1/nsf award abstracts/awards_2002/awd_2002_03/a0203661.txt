This U.S.-Mexico award will support a collaborative project
              between Dr. Scott Gold, of the University of Georgia, in Athens, Georgia, in
              collaboration with Dr. Jose Ruiz-Herrera of the Centro de Investigaciones y de
              Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) in Irapuato, Mexico.  The researchers aim to
              study corn smut fungi, a plant disease of cultivated maize, whose close
              relatives are important pathogens of many grain crops.  

Smut fungi grow in
              two morphologies, one form is a budding yeast while the second is typical of
              most fungi and is made up of long tubular cells of filaments. In corn smut,
              yeast cells cannot attack the plant but filaments can.  These two forms are
              also common in animal and human fungal pathogens and, again, morphology is
              often correlated with the ability to cause disease. The researchers have
              discovered mutations in genes that control the ability of the fungus to
              alternate between these two forms. The mutations thus far characterized
              dramatically affect smut disease progression. However, the morphogenetic
              stimuli used by the two research groups differ, the U.S side studying the
              signal transduction pathways and the Mexican side studying the effects of pH
              variations, with both groups observing similar phenotypic results in their
              studies. The work proposed here will continue to determine the relationship
              between these morphogenetic pathways by means of various experimental
              approaches. The information to be derived from this collaboration is likely to
              increase our understanding of fungal growth and diseases in general. In
              addition, the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in the
              collaboration will provide them with a significant international research and
              cultural experience.
