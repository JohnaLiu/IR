Abstract    :
              Transversal hot zones can form in commercial packed-bed reactors and may be
              deleterious because they may decrease the yield of the desired products,
              deactivate the catalyst and initiate runaway reactions that may ultimately
              result in explosions.  The PI plans to conduct experiments and theoretical
              numerical studies on hot zone formation and dynamics.  The problem is of both
              academic interest and engineering importance as the goal is not just to
              observe, analyze and characterize such hot zones, but to gain the ability to
              predict and control them.  

The PI plans experimental studies using an
              infrared imager of hot zone formation and motion for two test reactions: the
              oxidation of carbon monoxide and acetylene hydrogenation.  These experiments
              will be used to determine under what conditions hot zones form and what are
              their characteristic motions.  Numerical simulations of a three-dimensional
              two-phase model will be used to gain an understanding of the critical rate
              processes and parameters affecting hot zone formation in a uniform packed bed
              reactor.  The model will provide guidance about interesting regions for
              experimental study and for the organization of experimental
              observations.

Impact:

Hot spots and hot zones are a perennial problem of
              packed bed reactors.  Providing guidance from first principals on how to avoid
              or control them would have significant safety benefits for the industrial
              operation of chemical manufacturing systems.
