This US-Chile award will fund a collaborative project between
              Drs. John S. Selker and Richard H. Cuenca of Oregon State University, Mr. David
              E. Rupp, Oregon State, and Dr. Mark B. Parlange of Johns Hopkins University, in
              collaboration with Drs. Oscar Reckmann, Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones
              Agropecuarias, Samuel Ortega, Universidad de Talca, and Eduardo Varas,
              Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.  Their project will be to model and
              characterize the water budget in a region with a Mediterranean climate and
              high-slope, low permeability soils, the Chilean Secano Interior and Secano
              Costero.  The investigation of this system will involve the integration of
              field measurement and modeling, taking advantage of important advances in
              methods of data analysis, computation, and the upcoming availability of high
              resolution global digital elevation models.

This international collaboration
              will advance our scientific knowledge in determining the spatial and temporal
              distribution of the water budget in semi-arid regions.  The Chileans will gain
              technical expertise in new methods and instrumentation for water resource
              analysis and increase their understanding of the hydrologic fluxes in an
              impoverished region of their country.
