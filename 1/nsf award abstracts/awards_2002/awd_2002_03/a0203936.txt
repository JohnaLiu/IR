The goal of this project is to apply homotopy
              theoretic 
methods to algebraic problems.  There are two threads of 
ideas
              involved here.  One is the description of homotopy 
theory as a kind of
              topologically enriched category theory, 
as has been developed by Dwyer-Kan
              and many others.  Another 
thread is in the theory of commutative ring spectra
              (a homotopy theoretic generalization of commutative ring theory), and
in
              particular the development of a topological version of 
the algebraic de Rham
              complex of a ring.

Homotopy theory is a branch of topology; it arose as the
              
study of certain invariant properties of spaces, namely those 
left
              unchanged by continuous deformations.  It is a surprising 
fact that there are
              deep analogies between the methods of the 
homotopy theory of spaces (which
              would seem to be geometric and topological) and those of several branches of
              algebra (such as homological algebra, sheaf theory, and category theory).  For
              
example, there is a close analogy between the way we can 
describe an
              algebraic object (such as a group or ring) by
giving generators and the
              relations between them, and the 
way we can describe a topological space by
              giving polyhedra 
and the way they are attached together to give the space. 
              
The goal of this project is to develop certain homotopy 
theoretic methods
              in the context of ring theory and of 
category theory, and to allow them to be
              applied to
traditional algebraic problems.
