Abstract    :
               

This award provides funding for a three-year, Combined Research-Curriculum
              Development (CRCD) program, entitled, "Team Based Design: Collaboration Across
              Time and Space," at Carnegie Mellon University, under the direction of Dr.
              Daniel P. Siewiorek.  The goal of this project is to facilitate computer-based
              collaborative learning in project-based design courses by developing
              collaboration tools for mobile computers.
