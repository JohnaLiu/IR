Abstract    :
              The purpose of the project is to organize the International
Conference on
              Modern Algebra in Vanderbilt University (Nashville, TN, May 21-24, 2002) in
              conjunction with the 19th Shanks lectures. Professor Efim Zelmanov (Yale
              University), has agreed to deliver the Shanks lecture. The conference will
              focus on several fundamental areas of modern algebra and its
              applications:
group and semigroup theory, lattice theory and ordered
              tructures, model theory and universal algebra. Current and future trends in
              modern algebra will be the general theme. This grant will provide partial
              support for speakers, graduate students, post-doctoral students, and younger
              faculty.

At a fundamental level, group theory, lattice theory, and model
              theory, the topics of this conference, are tools for understanding and
              analyzing symmetries and patterns in the world around us.  For example,
              crystallography, the study and analysis of crystals, used once for inproving
              transistors and used today for studying protein structures, has advanced as
              group theory and lattice theory have advanced.  As another example, codes may
              be thought of as man-made patterns, and as such advances in group theory,
              lattice theory, and model theory lead to advances in cryptography and
              cryptanalysis.
