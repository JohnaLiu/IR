TITLE: CISE
              Postdoctoral Associates in Experimental Computer Science: Topologically
              Inspired Multi-Agent Robotic Systems with Coverage Tasks

The proposed
              research will contribute to the development of the underlying science in using
              topological information encoded in a free space to spatially allocate members
              of a multi-agent team to achieve a particular task.  Converge path planning (a
              new motion planning approach that determines a path ensuring a robot's end
              effector will pass over all points in a target region) will be used as the
              focusing task for multi-robot team allocation theory development and
              experimental verification.  The postdoctoral associate and the principal
              investigator will consider how to decrease the time of operation (i.e., work in
              parallel) and create qualitative synergies among robots working together in a
              team.  The expected outcome is a new geometric result based on Kalman filtering
              theory, which will support planning optimal motions for agents engaged in
              mutual positioning.  The associate will also participate in educational
              activities, specifically including robotic LEGO modules for undergraduate and
              middle school education.
