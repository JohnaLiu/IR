Abstract    :
              EIA-0203971 Gianfranco Ciardo College of William & Mary  Structured Methods to
              Evaluate the Performance of Distributed Software

Our goal is a collaborative
              research effort aimed at removing the computational barriers to the widespread
              adoption of Markov chain modeling technology in the software performance
              engineering process. 

We will approach the problem from different and
              complementary points of view, and have the necessary means to solve many of the
              remaining computational issues.  The results of the proposed research will open
              up the Markov modeling field to a surge of new, and probably unanticipated,
              research activity in very diverse areas of national and international
              importance, and provide a path towards the compositional performance assessment
              of systems built from off-the-shelf software modules.
