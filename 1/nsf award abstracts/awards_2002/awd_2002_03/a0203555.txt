This Americas award will support collaborative research
              between Drs. Scott E. Ishman and Nicholas Pinter of Southern Illinois
              University-Carbondale and Dr. Jacobus Le Roux, University of Chile, Dr.
              Guillermo Chong, Catholic University of Antofagasta, and Dr. Ruben
              Martinez-Pardo, National Museum of Natural History for their work on the
              Cenozoic Paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic evolution of Northern and Central
              Chile.  The project will be done in the Mejillones Peninsula (MP) region in the
              north near Antofagasta and the Navidad region in central Chile to the southwest
              of Santiago.

The northern region of Chile provides a unique geographic
              setting to investigate the oceanographic and climatic sensitivity of the
              eastern South Pacific to significant changes in Antarctic ice volume change as
              interpreted from sea-level records.  The Mejillones Basin is ideal for this
              research.  It represents a shallow marine setting developed on an active margin
              with nearby volcanism and other significant tectonic features.  Results from
              this proposed project will provide a better understanding of the
              interconnection between Antarctic ice volume change, oceanographic and
              atmospheric circulation, and the impacts these have on recurring oceanographic
              and meteorological events such as El Nino, which have global and economic
              significance.
