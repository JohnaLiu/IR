This UMEB project seeks to increase the participation
              of students from under-represented groups at two New York City colleges by
              engaging them in hands-on research projects in conservation genetics and
              environmental science in collaboration with scientists at their colleges and at
              the American Museum of Natural History.  In order to accomplish this, each year
              a cohort of 4-6 students from each college will be recruited and the students
              will conduct research projects over a two year period.  During the academic
              year, the research will be done on the home campuses.  Over the winter breaks
              and summers, research will be conducted at the American Museum of Natural
              History.  

These students will serve as a nucleus to get other students
              involved in environmental projects throughout the metropolitan area.  This UMEB
              project will involve students in workshops in molecular biology techniques,
              seminars in population biology, and workshops that provide graduate school and
              career guidance.  The students will be closely mentored and their progress
              monitored and assessed in order to help them become our future scientists in
              environmental biology and in order to develop additional programs capable of
              broadening participation in careers in environmental biology.
