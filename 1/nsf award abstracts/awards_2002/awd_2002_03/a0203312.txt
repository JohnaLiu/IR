Title: Models in superconductivity

ABSTRACT

The project is
              aimed at developing a variety of models in superconductivity.  The specific
              areas that are covered include mesoscopic networks, Josephson junctions, and
              time-dependent models. One of the goals is the derivation of specialized models
              in certain distinguished asymptotic limits.  Another goal is to study the
              relation between the applied magnetic field and the resulting current
              distribution as a function of the geometry and the topology of the
              network.

Superconductors form a special kind of material with the unique
              property that they exhibit quantum-mechanical (that is, atomic) effects on
              large scales that can be observed by the unaided eye.  This makes them
              wonderful candidates to our understanding of the basic laws that govern atomic
              phenomena.  It also makes them candidates for many applications ranging from
              very precise measuring devices and unusual generators of magnetic fields
              (already on the market) to quantum computers. To understand the behavior of
              superconductors we need mathematical models.  Moreover, since the standard
              model is very complicated, it is very useful to derive simpler models that fit
              special circumstances.  For example, some of the fascinating effects of
              superconductivity are observed when the material forms a complex network of
              thin wires.  I therefore derive special models to describe such geometries.
