This project investigates wide-area
              publish/subscribe event system models and architectures.  The focus is on two
              new models called Smart Events and Active Events, and an event bus architecture
              called Virtual Private Event Networks (VPENs).

Smart events are associated
              with a structural type model (a grammar or schema), and a semantic model that
              defines the processing to be performed on the structural subcomponents.  Smart
              events are routed via content-based messaging, where subscriptions may specify
              complex patterns indicating the events of interest. Active events include their
              semantic model directly as mobile code. Active events operate as
mobile agents
              transported (conceptually) under their own power point-to-point.  Smart events
              may optionally include active event substructures, enabling content-based
              messaging to be applied to this subset of active events.

VPENs extend
              multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) protocols and mechanisms to the
              application layer, to improve the performance of content-based routing by
              preplanning label switched paths when publisher advertisements as well as
              consumer subscriptions are available.  VPENs also add encryption-based security
              and privacy in the style of virtual private networks (VPNs).
