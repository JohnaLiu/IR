Dr. Donald Garnett, at the University of Arizona, will
              study the problem of why recombination lines (RLs) from twice-ionized oxygen
              (O), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and other heavy elements yield much higher
              abundances than the corresponding collisionally-excited forbidden lines (FLs)
              from the same species.  This problem challenges our confidence in abundances
              derived from planetary nebulae and ionized hydrogen (HII) regions in the Milky
              Way and other galaxies and their interpretation for stellar nucleosynthesis and
              chemical evolution studies.  In this project, Dr. Garnett will (1) map the
              spatial distribution of RLs and FLs in a variety of planetary nebulae and giant
              HII regions to determine how physical structures affect their distribution, (2)
              study the hot gas content using data from FUSE and X-ray satellite missions to
              see if the presence of hot gas is a contributing factor, and (3) examine the
              spatial variation of electron temperature using a variety of diagnostics to
              determine if large observed differences between the temperature derived from
              the Balmer line/continuum ratio and the temperature derived from forbidden line
              ratios are related to physical structures.  This project will use already
              existing and scheduled ground-based spectroscopy, FUSE spectra and Chandra/XMM
              imaging, as well as new ground-based spectroscopy of RLs in HII
              regions.
