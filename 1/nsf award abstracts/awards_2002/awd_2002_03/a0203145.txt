Fleming
This award supports Fraser Fleming and a student from Duquesne
              University in a collaboration with Paul Knochel of the Institute for Organic
              Chemistry at the University of Munich, Germany.  The project will focus on a
              fundamentally different approach to functionalized Grignard reagents with
              potential for significantly advancing knowledge of bifunctional reagents. 
              Three new amide-containing Grignard reagents will be examined where
              deprotonatin and silylation is used to mask and unmask the carbonyl group in
              situ.  The collaborative project provides an excellent opportunity for Fleming
              and the graduate student to pursue new ideas, cultivate creative solutions to
              significant problems, and learn new skills.  The project also provides an
              opportunity to establish a long-term relationship with the German group with
              the possibility of continued exchange of students.  The students will be able
              to experience the smaller, more personal environment of Duquesne University,
              and then perform research at the larger, research-intensive University of
              Munich, where they will also garner international experience and contacts.
