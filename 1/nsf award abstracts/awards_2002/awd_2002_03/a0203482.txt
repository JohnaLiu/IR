Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a three-year Combined Research-Curriculum
              Development (CRCD) program, entitled, "Environmental Informatics in Coastal
              Margins," at Texas A&M University College Station, the regional campuses in
              Corpus Christi and Kingsville, and the Texas Engineering Experiment Station,
              under the direction of Dr. James S. Bonner.  The overall objective of this
              project is to develop four new and significantly modified courses, which will
              provide the nation with the next generation of engineers and decision-makers
              able to utilize the latest environmental modeling tools in their designs and
              fully comprehend the environmental impacts of new developments on
              infrastructure and serve industries.
