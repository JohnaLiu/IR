The proposed research concerns the study
              of 3-manifolds.  The notion
of a 3-manifold constitutes the 3-dimensional
              analogue of the
2-dimensional notion of a surface.  The 2-dimensional notion
              of
surface is to be understood in a rather broad (and rather technical)
way. 
              It includes the 2-dimensional sphere (that tends to be pictured
as all points
              in 3-space at distance exactly 1 from the origin), the
torus (often, jokingly,
              described as ``the icing on a doughnut''), the
Klein bottle, and many others. 
              The study of 3-manifolds is
considerably more complex than that of surfaces. 
              Surfaces are
completely classified, 3-manifolds are not.  In fact, it is at
              present
unknown whether 3-manifolds can be classified (in an
              algorithmic
sense).  It is known that 4-manifolds cannot be classified. 
              The
research here endeavors to employ different types of surfaces lying
              in
3-manifolds and their relation to each other in a structural study
              of
3-manifolds.

The proposed research grows out of a study of the relation
              of Heegaard
splittings to Haken decompositions.  It turns out that the
              lessons
learnt in that investigation have applications to a wider range
              of
problems in 3-manifold topology ranging from additivity properties of
the
              generalized bridge numbers of knots and additivity properties of
the width of
              knots to questions about the genus of a Heegaard
splitting that is a common
              stabilization of two given Heegaard
splittings.  The methods for this
              investigation include a counting
technique developed by M. Scharlemann and the
              P.I along with the
notion of an orbifold Heegaard splitting.  The methods
              further include
the notion of untelescoping of Heegaard splittings, Cerf
              theory, thin
position arguments, and the analysis of foliations induced by
              Morse
functions corresponding to Heegaard splittings or untelescopings
              of
Heegaard splittings.  The proposed research also includes a strategy
to
              obtain a more structural theory of surfaces in knot complements.
