Abstract    :
              This award supports a collaborative research project between Dr. Richard T.
              Scalettar of the University of California Davis and Dr. Raimundo dos Santos of
              the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to study the nature of
              superconductivity in an attractive Hubbard Hamiltonian model. The model to be
              studied will have a random mix of attractive on-site interactions and sites
              with no attraction. A related model of borocarbides in which attrative Hubbard
              layers alternate with free layers where there is no interaction will also be
              studied. It is anticipated that this research will provide new insight into the
              nature of the superconducting phase transition and in particular the effect of
              impurity sites on pairing.
