Abstract    :
              This award is for an 18 month deployment of 43 PASSCAL broad band seismometers
              in Nicaragua and Costa Rica to seismically image the mantle "subduction
              factory" of the Central American volcanic arc in the region. In addition to the
              PASSCAL instruments, the PIs will also collaborate with Costa Rican and
              Nicaraguan seismologists to use data from existing short period and broadband
              instruments. The experiment will image the mantle wedge with receiver functions
              and other converted waves, together with regional waveform inversions.
              Tomographic imaging will be used to try to map the region of slab dewatering
              (and intermediate depth earthquake generation), melt generation and melt
              migration in the mantle wedge.  Patterns of mantle flow will be interpreted
              from shear wave splitting data, and crustal structure will be inferred from
              receiver functions. Overall, the idea is to infer the workings of the
              subduction factory by combining seismic images of the crust and mantle with the
              modeled interpretations of large observed differences in magma composition
              along  strike in the arc volcanoes.
