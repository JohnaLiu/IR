Abstract    :
              TITLE: Software Innovations for Liquid Architectures

     We propose to bring
              the advantages of custom logic to low-volume but high-performance applications
              by semiautomatically generating custom logic, deployed in reconfigurable logic.
               By coupling (hard-or soft-core) commodity processors with reconfigurable
              logic, an application is essentially offered a liquid architecture, where the
              definition and implementation of the computer's instruction set, its
              coprocessors' functionality, and its supporting structures can be easily
              changed.  These architectural changes can improve performance by supplying
              instructions and efficient implementations for frequently occurring operations,
              by changing the size or policies of caches and other supporting structures, and
              by dynamically exchanging speed for power-savings where required.

     With
              proper software support, liquid architectures can improve the performance of
              many kinds of applications, ranging from high-performance, scientific
              calculations to low-power, embedded systems.  Our research aims to develop the
              software infrastructure and methodologies needed to facilitate execution of
              applications on liquid architectures, addressing the following issues:
