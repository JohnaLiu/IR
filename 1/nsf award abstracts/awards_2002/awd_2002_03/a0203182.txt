The
              proposal is for travel support for the speakers at the EC-NSF workshop on
              "Nanotechnology - Revolutionary Opportunities and Societal Implications" to be
              held in Lecce, Italy on January 31-February 1, 2002.  The workshop will involve
              approximately 16 U.S. speakers and poster presenters and about the same number
              from the European Commission (EC).  The workshop is a part of a series of four
              workshops on nanotechnology organized by NSF and EC in 2002.  The objectives
              are to evaluate new trends in research and education, to exchange information
              among leading research centers in both countries, and to promote the exchange
              of researchers and establishment of joint projects.

Given the rapid
              expansion of Nanotechnology and the significant impact it has on products and
              services in the society, it is important to periodically examine and explore
              opportunities and implications on broad societal impacts.
