Abstract    :
              EIA-0203872 Daniel Menasce George Mason University A Framework for the Dynamic
              Composition and Reconfiguration of QoS-Aware Next Generation Software
              Systems

In large, dynamic, highly distributed, loosely coupled,
              component-based systems, it is necessary to use a framework for software system
              composition and dynamic reconfiguration that can support the evolution of
              functional and performance requirements as well environmental changes (e.g.,
              network, hardware and software failures).  The proposed method by which
              software systems in these environments are composed of autonomous components. 
              All components must have several capabilities (e.g., QoS negotiation,
              registration, QoS monitoring, etc) that are identical to all components.  What
              makes a component unique is the set of services it provides.  QoS-based
              approach , proposed to distribute software system composition and
              reconfiguration.  Our method uses resource reservation mechanisms at the
              component level to guarantee QoS requirements at the software system
              level.
