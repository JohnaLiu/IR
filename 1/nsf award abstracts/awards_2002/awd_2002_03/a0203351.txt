Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the processes of sediment transport and
              accumulation that lead to development of the shelf clinoform in the Gulf of
              Papua off the Fly River. The study will include a variety of sampling and
              monitoring stations from near the river mouth to the base of the clinoform that
              will provide time-series observations on the spatial and temporal variation in
              present day sediment transport and accumulation.   The study will specifically
              investigate the role of fluid muds as primary mechanism for across-shelf
              transport of sediment that leads to clinoform morphology.  Core studies
              including radioisotope measurements will provide information of sediment
              transport and accumulation on seasonal to millennial time scales.
