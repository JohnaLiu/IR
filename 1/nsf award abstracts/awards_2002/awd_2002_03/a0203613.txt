Abstract    :
              The Research Vessel (R/V) Cape Hatteras is a general purpose Regional Class
              vessel, owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by the Duke
              University/University of North Carolina Oceanographic Consortium.  Since its
              construction and delievery in 1981, the vessel has operated from its homeport
              at Duke University Marine Laboratory in Beaufort, North Carolina.  For the past
              20 years, the vessel has supported a variety of oceanographic research funded
              by the National Science Foundation, Office of Naval Research, United States
              Geological Survey, Naval Oceanographic Office, the Department of Energy, and
              the State of North Carolina.  Funds in this proposal were requested to upgrade
              and enhance the capabilities of the R/V Cape Hatteras.  Renovations and
              modifications will enable scientists to utilize state of the art
              instrumentation and equipment; to work on a safe and modern platform; and allow
               the ship to operate for approximately another 10 years in the North Atlantic
              coastal region.  This mid-life refit would include the renovation and upgrading
              of all cabins, labs, and interior spaces; relocation of the aft crane to the
              winch deck; the addition of two science berths; the replacement of all helm and
              engine controls; the replacement of most interior plumbing; and the replacement
              of all exterior and interior coatings.
