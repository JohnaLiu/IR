Abstract    :
               

This award provides funding for a three-year Combined Research-Curriculum
              Development (CRCD) program, entitled "Towards a New Chemical and Biomolecular
              Engineering Curriculum," at the University of Notre Dame, under the direction
              of Dr. Agnes E. Ostafin. The overall objective of this project is to develop
              curricular material (text, web and laboratory) that will demonstrate how to
              integrate molecular and cellular biology into chemical engineering, in the same
              way as chemistry has traditionally been integrated, to produce Chemical and
              Biomolecular Engineers.
