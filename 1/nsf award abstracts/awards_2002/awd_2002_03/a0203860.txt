Abstract    :
              Interest in organic solid state chemistry has undergone explosive growth in
              recent years due to the broadly based recognition of the scientific challenges
              and technological importance attached to the discovery and study of new organic
              andpoilymeric materials.  Many scientists from other disciplines see
              opportunities for performing exciting research in this area.  The 2002
              Electronic Processes in Organic Materials Gordon Research Conference will be
              held at Salve Regina University, Newport, Rhode Island from July 21-26, 2002. 
              The goal of the conference is to facilitate international collaborations and
              informatation exchange across a broad spectrum of researchers with interests in
              solid state organic materials.  The NSF funds will be used to support the
              attendance of 5 graduate students and post-doctoral scholars and 7 senior U.S.
              session chairs and invited speakers.

The Solid State Chemistry community
              continues to have direct impact on technological areas that are crucial to
              advancing societal needs through the design, synthesis and application new
              materials.  Specific area in which important advances are being made include
              organic superconductors, field-effect transisters, lasers, conducting wires,
              light emitting diodes and semiconductors. J Since these technical areas are of
              very high priority to industry, students educated and trained in these
              multidisciplinary areas involving solid-state organic chemistry compete very
              well in the job market and go on to contribute in many significant ways to the
              global economy.
