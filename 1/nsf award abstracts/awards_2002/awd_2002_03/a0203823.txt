	Let [x(t), 0< t< T] be a realized path of a diffusion process
              with an unknown multi-dimensional parameter u in its coefficients. The
              Principle Investigator and his students are interested in estimating the real
              value of u. They discovered that they can define a Maximum Likelihood Estimator
              U of the unknown u even if u appeared in the diffusion coefficient. They are
              going to find the rate of convergence of U to the true parameter u under
              reasonable assumptions when the observation time is relatively long enough.
              Since in the real applications, x(t) can be only recorded at discrete time
              spots, they are particularly interested in the problems of error estimates
              related to discretizations of their models. 
	The Principle Investigator and
              his students' research has its interests in the real applications. There are
              many examples of parameter estimates of diffusion processes in the
              applications. For example, it may be related to the trace of a military
              missile, or the price of a stock. All those models contain some unknown
              parameters. Moreover, any observation of the real path contains errors.
              Assuming that the observation error can be only bounded by a constant c, then
              no matter how one increases the computation steps in the time discretization
              method, the error of the estimate can not be significantly reduced beyond some
              number. In other words, the Principle Investigator and his students will find
              out the minimum steps needed for a computer to get enough accurate result when
              an observation error is recognized. This study has its potential military and
              financial applications.
