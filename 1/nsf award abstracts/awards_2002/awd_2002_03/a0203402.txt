Abstract    :
              The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this award to
              Furman University to prepare solid-state charge-transfer complexes from
              functionalized diacetylenes.  With this award, Professors Timothy Hanks at
              Furman University and William Pennington at Clemson University will prepare
              three types of polymeric materials - crystalline and microcrystalline powders,
              and amorphous thin films - from hosts derived from donor diacetylene molecules
              with attached inclusion acceptor-compounds - organo-iodides - in a 'pocket' or
              'cavity' of the polymeric material. Nanoporous zeolite type materials will be
              prepared from these polymers after removal of the inclusion compounds by
              thermolysis or solvent extraction. A number of donor molecules, which not only
              photopolymerize, but also provide cavities of different sizes and shapes for
              acceptor molecules, will be synthesized and characterized, and these studies
              may result in new classes of porous organic solids with tunable optical,
              electronic and chemical properties.

The zeolite-like nanoporous materials
              that will be prepared in this study are expected to have tunable optical,
              electronic and chemical properties. This project at a primarily undergraduate
              institution, which has an active research program with undergraduate and high
              school students, will provide, in addition, research and educational
              opportunities in material synthesis and characterization.
