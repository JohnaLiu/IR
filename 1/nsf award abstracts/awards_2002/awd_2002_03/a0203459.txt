Abstract    :
               

This award provides funding for a three-year Combined Research-Curriculum
              Development (CRCD) program, entitled "Curriculum Development in Systems for
              Smart Communications," at Villanova University, under the direction of Dr.
              Robert H. Caverly. The overall objective of this project is to develop a series
              of educational concept modules covering basic and advanced topics in smart
              communications technology that overlap not only the principal investigators'
              research but also the "best practices" in the field.
