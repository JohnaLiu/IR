Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a group at the University of Cincinnati for a
              program of research and education in experimental elementary particle physics
              based on the BaBar experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC).
              They are also completing the analysis of a hadronic charm production experiment
              E791 at Fermilab.

The main aim of BaBar is to study the origin of
              particle-antiparticle asymmetry (CP violation) as seen in the decays of neutral
              B mesons (B0s) and their antiparticles. The Standard Model of elementary
              particle interactions predicts such CP asymmetries. The BaBar experiment is
              designed to detect many of the B decay modes and thus to study the
              time-dependence of CP violation. In addition to the analysis contributions, the
              group is also involved with the operations and software development of the DIRC
              (Detector of Internally Reflected Cherenkov radiation).
