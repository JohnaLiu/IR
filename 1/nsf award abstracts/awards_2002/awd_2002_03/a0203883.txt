Geometric Group Theory and the Topology of
              3-Manifolds

The proposer plans to continue his joint work with Gadde Swarup
              on
connections between geometric group theory and the topology
              of
3-manifolds. In the 1970's, the theory of the characteristic 
submanifold
              of a compact 3-manifold was completed. Starting in the
mid 1980's, it began to
              be apparent that there were analogues of 
this topological result in the
              purely algebraic setting. Several 
authors have worked on this in the last 15
              years, but so far none 
of the results have been truly analogous to the
              topological 
results except in very special cases. Now the proposer and
              Swarup
have produced the first true algebraic analogues of the 
topological
              results and they plan to continue their investigations
in order to see how far
              their results can be carried. Their 
arguments and results have already given
              new insights into the 
topology of 3-manifolds and led to new results in
              geometric group
theory. The proposer expects that further work in this area
              will
have a significant impact on geometric group theory.

The proposer
              plans to continue his joint work with Gadde Swarup on
connections between
              group theory and the theory of 3-dimensional
manifolds. About 40 years ago,
              some remarkable, and entirely 
unexpected, work of Stallings first
              demonstrated the depth of 
these connections. More recently, work of several
              authors 
continued this theme by showing that groups can be decomposed in
              a
fashion closely analogous to the way in which 3-dimensional 
manifolds can
              be decomposed. The proposer and Swarup have given a 
new approach to this area
              and they plan to continue their 
investigations in order to see how far their
              results can be 
carried. Their arguments and results have already given new
              
insights into the theory of 3-dimensional manifolds and led to new
results
              in group theory. The proposer expects that further work in
this area will have
              a significant impact on group theory.
