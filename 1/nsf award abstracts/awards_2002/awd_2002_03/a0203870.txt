Abstract    :
              TITLE: Towards Community Services:  Putting Parallel Network Services
              On-line

This project will investigate a community service system
              architecture and run-time infrastructure needed to support such high-end
              services.  We will focus on two key run-time issues for performance: dynamic
              resource management and scaling.  Dynamic resource management allows:  (i)
              resources to be {de-} allocated to service requests on-the-fly, (ii) resources
              to be acquired via negotiation, and (iii) resources to be shared across
              inter-service domains.  Resource management will be based on a performance
              estimation technique that learns service execution time as function of
              dependent inputs and resources allocated.  We will produce a set of next
              generation tools and libraries that can be leveraged by community services
              running in single-site clusters and in multi-site Grids.  The toolset will be
              evaluated by applying it to several high-end network services in the area of
              visualization, astronomy, and bioinformatics.
