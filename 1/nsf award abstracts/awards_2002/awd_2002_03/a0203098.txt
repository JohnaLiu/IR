Abstract    :
              Elimination of the need for painstaking alignment of coronal X-ray images with
              vector magnetograms and for expert scrutiny of the X-ray structure of the core
              field is an important step toward practical operational forecasting of
              Earth-directed Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and their geoeffectiveness from
              vector magnetographs. An empirical evaluation of the reliability of core
              magnetic field determinations based upon three distinct methods will be carried
              out. These magnetogram-alone methods of resolving the 180 degree ambiguity in
              the direction of the transverse magnetic field in cases of strong shear and
              twist will be tested with a set of 20-30 active regions where coeval X-ray data
              can be used to define the field direction. The active regions that have
              strongly sheared core magnetic fields are most likely to produce CMEs, and
              knowledge of the orientation of this core field is important for anticipating
              the direction of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) at Earth.
