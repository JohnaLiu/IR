Abstract    :
              It proposes to convene at Atmospheric CO 2 Inversion Intercomparison Workshop at
              the Colorado State University campus in Fort Collins, Colorado in February
              2002.  This workshop will focus upon issues central to the IGBP Task force on
              Global Analysis, Interpretation and Modelling (GAIM) with strong links to the
              Carbon Joint Project (CJP).  The workshop will build on the results of a
              previous TransCom workshop held in Melbourne, Australia in March 2001. 
              Proposed project seeks to bring the research community together for the purpose
              of finalizing current activities through the analysis and synthesis of several
              ongoing activities:  1) Analysis of seasonal, stationary and time-dependent
              inversions in an attempt to identify a central, control TM version of each; 2. 
              Data sensitivity tests (testing inverse results against various spatial and GCM
              sub-sampling schemes); 3. Optimization of sampling networks, both selectively
              and with a genetic algorithm; 4 Comparison of the seasonality, the phase and
              amplitude of the rectifier effects with data; 5. Collaboration with other
              groups (SCRIPPS/SIO) on an Atmospheric Potential Oxygen (APO) experiment; and
              6) Development of collaboration with the Biosphere-Atmosphere Stable Isotope
              (BASIN) community.

Workshop will include 20 participants representing
              inverse modeling groups that are currently contributing to TransCom analyses
              and syntheses.
