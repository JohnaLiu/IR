Workshops on Topics in Computational
              Geometry
This proposal is to support a series of annual problem-posing and
              problem-solving
workshops on emerging new topics in Computational Geometry,
              with applications in Graphics, Robotics, CAD, BioComputing, etc.  The requested
              funds will support students, post-docs and some invited participants. The 
              workshop is aiming at fostering collaborations between disciplines
              (mathematics, computer  science, engineering), identifying new directions and
              problems to work on, and engaging representatives from under-represented groups
              in collaborative research opportunities (we anticipate about half of the
              participants to be female researchers or students).  A new topic will be chosen
              each year by the organizer. A web page will be prepared for  each workshop,
              which will include links to resulting publications.  There will be no
              registration fee. The chosen location (Bellairs Research Institute of McGill
              University in Barbados, West Indies) already has a long tradition within our
              community (McGill researchers have very successfully organized such workshops
              on various topics for over 15 years, and the institute's facilities have been
              used by other academic institutions in the US and Canada). It allows for
              informal and very productive interaction, it has inexpensive lodging and is
              accessible via major US carriers at
reasonably priced airfare.
