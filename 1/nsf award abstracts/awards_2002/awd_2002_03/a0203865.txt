	Problems on the asymptotic behavior of functionals of the
              empirical distribution have long attracted the interest of probabilists and
              have led to the development of new methods and theory that have enriched both
              mathematical statistics and probability theory. A classic example is the
              problem of the asymptotic distribution of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic,
              which ultimately led to the development of the theory of weak convergence and
              strong approximations. Over the next few years the investigator plans to
              concentrate his efforts on large sample theory problems connected with
              particular functionals of the empirical distribution. These include the L1-norm
              density estimator process, integral functionals of density estimators and local
              empirical and U-statistics processes.
	The anticipated results should have
              potential use in the development of a class of practical goodness-of-fit
              techniques and statistical estimators. In fact, these investigations have
              already given rise to a number of new methods to assess and describe in an
              intelligent way the behavior of the underlying mechanism that generates natural
              phenomena.
