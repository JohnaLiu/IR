Abstract    :
              A combined global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of the solar corona and inner
              heliosphere will be used to interpret SOHO and Yohkoh solar observations in
              addition to ACE and Ulysses in-situ measurements of coronal mass ejections
              (CMEs). SAIC's global model will be employed to initiate the CME disturbance
              and follow its evolution out to 20 solar radii. NOAA/SEC's heliospheric model
              will subsequently pick up these structures at 20 solar radii and propagate them
              out to 5 AU. Thus a global context will be constructed wherein one may connect
              the disparate solar and in situ observations. A unique and powerful perspective
              is thus provided to address fundamental issues concerning the origin, magnetic
              topology, and space weather evolution of CMEs. The events identified for
              simulation are to be selected by the SHINE community, and the simulation
              results will be available to the community on-line, in order to enhance the
              scientific return of this investigation.
