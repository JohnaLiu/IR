Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a three-year Combined Research-Curriculum
              Development (CRCD) program, entitled, "Photovoltaic Device Processing-A
              Systemic Curriculum and Research Program, " at the University of Arizona, under
              the direction of Dr. Dunbar P. Birnie.  The overall objective of this project
              is to expose and integrate numerous students into the complexities of
              photovoltaic device design-both in their class work and by incorporating them
              into state-of-the-art research.
