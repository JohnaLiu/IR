Abstract    :
              Jack W. Davidson Illinois Institute of Technology Collaborative Research: 
              Continuous Compilation:  A New Approach to Aggressive and Adaptive Code
              Transformation

     Today's challenge for optimization research is to
              develop new techniques and approaches that yield performance improvements that
              were typical of early optimization research-20 to 40 percent and more.  In this
              research, we address this challenge by investigation and developing an
              innovative system or applying optimizations.  Our system, the Continuous
              Compilation System (CoCo), applies optimizations both statically at
              compile-time and dynamically at run-time using optimization plans developed at
              compile time and adapted at run time.

     To demonstrate the practicality
              and utility of our approach, initially we will apply CoCo to several large,
              long-running applications.  Examples of such applications include ecological
              simulations, weather simulation, architecture simulators, and VLSI routing and
              placement applications.  As we gain insight and experience with the application
              of continuous compilation, we will investigate its effectiveness on other types
              of codes such as multimedia applications, signal processing applications, and
              web servers.
