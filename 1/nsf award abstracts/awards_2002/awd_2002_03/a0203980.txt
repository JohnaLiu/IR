This grant proposes to use E-infinity
              differential 
graded algebras to study the homotopy theory of spaces 
and
              proposes to study the homotopy theory of E-infinity 
differential graded
              algebras and E-infinity ring spectra.  
The concept of E-infinity differential
              graded algebra 
is a generalization of the concept of commutative
              
differential graded algebra; commutativity holds only 
up to homotopy, and
              E-infinity differential graded algebras 
admit Steenrod operations on their
              cohomology, which 
measure to some extent the deviation from actual
              
commutativity.  E-infinity ring spectra are a stable 
homotopy theory
              generalization of E-infinity differential 
graded algebras.  Most commonly
              studied generalized 
cohomology theories that have commutative ring structures
              
are represented by E-infinity ring spectra. This extra
structure yields
              important calculational information about 
the theory and is useful for
              various constructions of 
related theories.

Algebraic topology tries to
              reduce topological or geometric
classification problems into algebra.  Because
              the algebra 
is usually discrete, it is typically invariant under changes 
by
              continuous deformations, or ``homotopies.''  Because of 
this, fundamental
              problems in algebraic topology are often 
phrased in terms of understanding
              the homotopy equivalence 
classes of spaces or in terms of computing the
              number (or 
more often the ``group'' or ``module'') of homotopy classes 
of
              maps between spaces.  Quite generally this kind of question 
can be
              reformulated as an equivalent question in algebra.
The purpose of this
              proposal is to develop tools to study 
the sort of algebra that arises in this
              context.
