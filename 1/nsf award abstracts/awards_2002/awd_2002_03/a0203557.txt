Abstract    :
              
While many of the insights are readily demonstrated for dense linear algebra
              operations, there are natal extensions that impact sparse direct methods. It is
              the goal of the proposed project to pursue a unified approach to all of these
              insights in an effort to put software architectures of linear algebra libraries
              for this domain of operations on a solid scientific footing.  We will undertake
              a one year pilot project that will demonstrate the following: (1) The
              systematic approach can be used to derive highly efficient kernels for
              specialized dense linear algebra operations that are encountered in sparse
              direct methods; (2) The abstract program interface that has been demonstrated
              to allow high-performance implementation of dense linear algebra operations
              will be extended to apply to sparse matrices that are viewed as hierarchical
              matrices; (3) We will lay the foundation for a mathematical description of
              sparse matrices as hierarchical matrices which we believe will allow the
              derivation methods to be extended to operations on hierarchical matrices.
