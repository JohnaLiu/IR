Abstract    :
              Interest in a class of  new class of liquid crystal materials referred to as
              banana liquid crystals is presently very high among the chemistry, physics and
              liquid crystal device community. A workshop to be held in the Fall of 2002 will
              be hosted by the Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal Materials Research Center, an NSF
              MRSEC at the University of Colorado at Boulder to address important and timely
              research issues that have recently emerged. This will include discussing and
              agreeing on a much needed classification system to replace the existing
              convention based on order of discovery. The funds will be used to assist junior
              faculty, post-docs, and graduate students to attend and present their own
              research. 

The liquid crystal community continues to have direct impact on
              education and the development of new materials for technological advances of
              high significance to society. The latter include the development of novel
              electro optic devices of high commercial interest.
