Abstract    :
              The Mathematical Association of America (MAA) proposes to investigate the
              feasibility of developing an online magazine in the history of mathematics and
              its use in teaching, with a target audience of grades 9-14 teachers of
              mathematics.  The online magazine, a new component of the NSF-funded
              Mathematical Sciences Digital Library, is intended to be a living, growing
              resource, and will incorporate features such as hyperlinks and interactive
              graphics.  A range of materials will be included in the magazine including
              expository articles, translations of original sources, historical problems, a
              mathematical calendar, reviews of books and websites, teaching materials and
              translations of articles previously published in other languages.
