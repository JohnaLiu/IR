Abstract    :
              This project will identify all the shocks in 1 AU spacecraft data from IMP 8
              (1973-2001), WIND (1994-2001), and ACE (1997-end of grant) and characterize
              their strength and orientation. Comparisons of multi-spacecraft data for the
              same shock will be used to determine the scale size of the events. These long
              data sets will then be employed to document the solar-cycle variations in shock
              frequency and characteristics. A cross-correlation of the determined shock
              characteristics with geomagnetic activity indices will be carried out in order
              to determine if knowledge of upstream shock characteristics is useful in
              predicting the duration and severity of geomagnetic storms.
