Abstract    :
              Participation in the US-Japan Joint Panel on Wind and Seismic Effects offers a
              unique vehicle for U.S. and Japanese agencies interested in seismic and wind
              effects on structures to collaborate on research, exchange technical data and
              information, and exchange researchers for the benefit of both countries.
              Further, the Panel provides the opportunity to leverage limited research
              resources by closely coordinating work conducted in the U.S. and Japan to avoid
              duplication of effort.
