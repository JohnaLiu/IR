UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA/SCRIPPS

Award is for a
              project to conduct a series of flux meter measurements along transects across
              hydrological boundaries in the down going plate off Costa Rica. This region is
              characterized by anomalously low heat flow, except over regions of topographic
              highs that exhibit anomalously high heat flow values. The flux meter
              measurements will test the hypothesis that the regions of low heat flow are
              characterized by downward fluid flow, while the high-heat-flow areas are
              characterized by upward fluid flow. A second portion of the project will be to
              return the areas on the accretionary prism where 35 flux meters were deployed
              as part of a previous study, to collect piston cores and heat flow
              measurements. Analyses of these cores will result in co-located temperature,
              chemical gradient, and direct fluid flux data sets that will provide a more
              complete hydrological picture of the incoming plate and the Costa Rica
              forearc.
