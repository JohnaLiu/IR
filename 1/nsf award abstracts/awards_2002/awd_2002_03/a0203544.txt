This three-year award for US-UK cooperative research in
              atmospheric chemistry involves Anthony J. Hynes and his students at the
              University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science and
              Michael J. Pilling at the University of Leeds' School of Chemistry.  The
              project will focus on the role of complex intermediates in reactions of the
              hyroxyl radical (OH) in the atmosphere.  The objective is to use theory to
              examine important OH reactions in the atmosphere and use the results to guide
              experimental procedures.  Chemical reactions of OH and NO2 to form nitric acid
              will be studied along with the role of intermediates in recombination and
              impact in the troposphere and stratosphere.  These reactions are of importance
              to understanding ozone production and causes of air pollution.  

Each group
              brings unique complementary expertise to the project. The US investigator is an
              experimentalist and the British are expert theorists in atmospheric chemical
              kinetics.  The project will advance doctoral research of US students and
              provide research training in an international environment.
