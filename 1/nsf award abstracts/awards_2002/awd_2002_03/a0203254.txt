Abstract    :
              This award will allow 23 scientists from U.S. universities to participate in an
              international conference on "Southern Hemisphere Temperate Ecosystems and
              Biota: Contributions towards a Global Synthesis" to be held January 2004 in
              Cape Town South Africa.  This conference will constitute the IV Congress of the
              Southern Connection, an organization of approximately 400 scientists with an
              interest in comparative studies of the biota and ecosystems of the southern
              hemisphere temperate latitudes.  The Congress will include plenary addresses,
              symposia, oral contributed papers, contributed posters, special discussion
              sessions on chosen topics including technical workshops, and field trips. 
              Works to be presented and discussed at the conference will describe the results
              of original research in fields such as ecosystem ecology (primarily terrestrial
              ecosystems but also marine ecosystems), evolutionary ecology, landscape
              ecology,  paleontology, plant-animal interactions, phylogeny, evolution,
              paleoecology, ecological and historical biogeography, biological invasions,
              vegetation history, and ecosystem restoration and sustainable management. This
              workshop is co-funded through Ecosystem Science; Ecology; Geography and
              Regional Sciences; and the Office of Science and Engineering.
