Abstract    :
               

This award provides funding for a three-year Combined Research-Curriculum
              Development (CRCD) program, entitled, "Intermetallic Compounds and Composites,"
              at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, under the direction of Dr. Peter K.
              Liaw. The overall objective of this project is to integrate the long-standing
              research advances on the manufacture, characterization, modeling, and design of
              intermetallics and composites, achieved by UT and the nearby Oak Ridge National
              Laboratory (ORNL), into a multidisciplinary undergraduate and graduate
              curriculum at UT.
