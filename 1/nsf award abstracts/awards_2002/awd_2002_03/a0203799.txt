Abstract    :
              Science Summary:  This study will provide laboratory measurements of the
              coefficient of friction of natural sediments entering the subduction systems of
              Nankai, and Costa Rica. The frictional studies will be conducted in a
              combination of ring shear and direct shear experiments at effective confined
              stresses between 0.1-50 Mpa.  Samples will be characterized by X-ray
              diffraction (for bulk and clay mineralogy) grain-size, SEM/EDS geochemistry,
              and wet chemistry (for biogenic silica content).  The mechanical properties
              will be compared with the clay mineralogy to determine the effect of clay
              minerals on the coefficient of friction. The study will assess the role of the 
              smectite to illite transition and opal to quartz reactions on controlling the
              up-dip limit of seismogenic activity in subduction zones.
