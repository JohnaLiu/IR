Abstract    :
              The Accessible Retired Computers in Biology (ARCiB) project will provide ongoing
              transitional support for software packages, especially those associated with
              structural biology, as existing hardware platforms are replaced.  This will
              reduce disruption to research and education programs that use these software
              packages.  ARCiB will be used to help support existing packages and make them
              available by remote access.  If packages are open source and developer would
              like to transfer all or part of the support, the ARCiB will offer both an
              archive location for source and binaries as well as making the packages
              available.  Undergraduates are actively involved in the research program for
              maintaining this multi-platform interoperability.
