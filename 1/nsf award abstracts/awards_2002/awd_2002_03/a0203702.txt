This U.S.-Chile Program award will provide support for
              cooperative research between Dr. A. F. Ivanov of Pennsylvania State University
              and Drs. Manuel A. Pinto and Sergei I. Trofimchuk of the Universidad de Chile
              in Santiago, and Dr. Samuel A. Castillo of Universidad del Bio-Bio in
              Conception, Chile.  They will work on aspects of the qualitative theory of
              functional differential equations.

The aim of this project is to study both
              qualitatively and numerically,  the global dynamics of solutions of functional
              differential equations and systems of such equations including questions of the
              existence, stability, dependence on parameters and bifurcation of periodic
              solutions, chaotic behavior, and global stability of equilibria.  It will
              emphasize the study of global stability and periodic solutions of equations
              modeling real life of phenomena and asymptotic behavior in difference and
              discretized functional differential equations.  The significance of the project
              lies in its potential to solve several important theoretical mathematical
              problems, thus further developing the qualitative theory of the field.
