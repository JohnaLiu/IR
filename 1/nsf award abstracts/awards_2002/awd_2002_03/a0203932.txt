Image based rendering
              is a promising area of innovation in computer graphics. In image based
              rendering,
one starts with an input set of images or a video sequence. One
              then applies some degree of processing
to this data to obtain an intermediate
              representation. This intermediate representation is then used in
              an
interactive computer graphics setting. These interactive uses include but
              are not limited to: viewing the
scene from novel points of view that were not
              available in the input sequence, relighting the scene using
virtual lights
              that were not available in the input sequence, and geometrically manipulating
              the objects that
make up the scene. This functionality greatly enlarges the
              uses of digital photographs, and introduces a rich
source of content for use
              in interactive computer graphics.
For image based rendering, we plan to focus
              on lumigraph representations, which are a sampled repre-sentation of the light
              that travels along the rays in the scene. In particular, the visual information
              of a static scene is represented by the five dimensional radiance function.
              This function describes the intensity and color of light for every 2D direction
              at every 3D spatial position (x; y; z). If we consider only the
subset of
              light leaving the convex hull bounded object (or equivalently entering a
              bounded empty region of
space), the fact that radiance along any ray remains
              constant 1 allows us to reduce the domain of interest of
the radiance function
              from five to four dimensions.
