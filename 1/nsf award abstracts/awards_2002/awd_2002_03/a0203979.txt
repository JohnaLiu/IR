              ABSTRACT DMS - 0203979.

This project deals with three areas of Riemannian
              geometry, namely,
nonnegative sectional curvature, negative sectional
              curvature,
and almost nonnegative Ricci curvature. Specifically, we
              continue
the search of new examples of metrics of nonnegative
              sectional
curvature and obstructions to their existence, especially in
              the
simply-connected case, we plan to analyze the structure of open
pinched
              negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent fundamental
groups, and to study
              the difference between nonnegative and
almost nonnegative Ricci
              curvatures.


One of the main goals of modern geometry is to obtain
              global
qualitative information about a space by measuring its
              local
quantitative properties. Say, it has been known since the
nineteenth
              century that a space that locally looks like an egg
must globally look like an
              egg, not like a doughnut or a jungle gym.
This project deals with similar
              matters for higher dimensional
spaces, some of which occur naturally in
              physics and engineering.
