Abstract    :
              This theoretical project explores the fundamental physics of electronic,
              magnetic and
Transport properties of nanoscale magnetic junctions.  The major
              emphasis is on spin-
Polarized electronic transport in the nanojunctions, in
              which a small amount of various
Metallic, semiconducting or insulating
              materials is placed as a contact between two
Ferromagnetic nanowires. 
              First-principles density functional calculations will be
Performed to predict
              electronic, magnetic and transport chacteristics of these
Nanojunctions. 
              Micromagnetic modeling will be used to understand the magnetic
Structure of
              nanocontacts and tight-binding models will be developed to tread
              disordered
Systems and to explore the influence of localized states on
              magnetotransport in magnetic
Tunnel junctions.  These theoretical studies will
              guide experimental investigations of the 
Nanoscale junction fabricated by
              state-of-the-art nanofabrication techniques and will
Complement the
              established experimental program at Nebraska.  The research will
Facilitate
              the development of novel magnetoelectronic devices, which merge spin
              degrees
Of freedom into electronic nanotechnologies.
