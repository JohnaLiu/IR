Abstract    :
              Dorothy H. Gibson of the University of Louisville (Kentucky) is supported by the
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program for research on
              cyclical catalytic systems that reduce carbon dioxide to organic compounds that
              contain one or two carbon atoms (together with oxygen and hydrogen atoms). A
              long-term benefit of such research would be development of efficient cyclical
              catalytic systems that could produce fuels from the ubiquitous 'green-house
              gas,' carbon dioxide. One main aim of the research is to identify effective
              catalysts and catalytic cycles. A second main goal will be to increase
              understanding of how such cyclical catalysts function. A main thrust of the
              research is to explore the causes and effects of catalytic reactions in which
              there are changes in the number of coordination sites (on metal atoms) spanned
              by particular ligands ('variable denticity').  Both electrochemical and
              photochemical techniques will be employed.

Target reduction products include
              formic acid, formaldehyde and methanol, and also glyoxylic acid and glycolic
              acid. Catalytic species being investigated include a number of rhenium, rhodium
              and ruthenium complexes that contain both bipyridine molecules (as 'electronic
              reservoirs') and other ligands that have the ability to change (reversibly)
              between bidentate and terdentate configurations. Preliminary results have
              identified several promising catalytic systems. A number of examples of
              putative reaction intermediates have been prepared and characterized.
