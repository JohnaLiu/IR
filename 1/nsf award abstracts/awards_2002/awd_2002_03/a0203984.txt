Abstract    :
              EIA-0203984  Jack J. Dongarra University of Tennessee  Component-based
              Frameworks for High-Performance Distributed Scientific Applications
              

Scientific computer applications are continuing to evolve to solve more
              complex physical problems.  The result is an increase in composite applications
              that are built from smaller element applications, each of which model a simpler
              physical problem.  As composite applications are generally large, they tend to
              be built by teams.  In addition, these composite applications tend to be
              distributed over a number of computers using a combination of data-parallel and
              task-parallel designs.  They typically share data via files and databases. 
              More sophisticated designs will include message passing, remote event signals,
              and other distributed computing techniques.

To realize this vision, we must
              overcome significant scientific and technical obstacles.  The proposed project
              includes research on a programming model for large, composite, scientific
              applications that are targeted to run in computer Grid environments.  This
              research will focus on developing efficient techniques to program and execute
              these applications including support for managing behavioral aspects of
              integrating element applications into a composite application.  This research
              will be use to develop a component-based framework where a clear, concise, and
              accurate description of such applications can be created and used to execute
              the application in a high-performance, distributed environment.
