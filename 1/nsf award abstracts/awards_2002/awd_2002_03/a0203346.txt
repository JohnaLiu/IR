Abstract    :
              Christopher Cramer of the University of Minnesota is supported by the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop new theoretical
              methods for organic and inorganic systems characterized by multiple electronic
              states spanning relatively narrow energy ranges.  Development will focus on
              several areas, including generalized-Born equilibrium and non-equilibrium
              solvation models, the extension of existing continuum solvation models to new
              atoms and new functionalities, and the development of new orthogonalized
              density functional theory schemes for treating low-lying excited states.  These
              models will be applied in conjunction with existing methodologies to target
              chemistries of particular interest, including applications to arylnitrenium
              ions, phosphinidenes, arynes, dioxodicopper compounds, and metallocenes.
              

Many theoretical calculations apply only to molecules in the gas phase,
              rather than the more common experimental conditions of molecules in the
              condensed phase.  This research will improve the understanding of complex
              molecular reactions in solution, with applications to a variety of useful
              problems important to chemistry and biology.
