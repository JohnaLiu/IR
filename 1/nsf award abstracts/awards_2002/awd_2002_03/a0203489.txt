Abstract    :
              This project is an observational and data analysis project to examine and
              understand the differences between the two types of coronal mass ejections
              (CMEs).  CME events during solar cycles 22 and 23 will be identified using the
              coronagraph data from Skylab, the Solar Maximum Mission, Solwind, and SOHO. 
              Groundbased coronal measurements from the Mauna Loa coronagraph will also be
              used.  The association of CME events with active regions and with quiescent
              prominences will be studied.  The observations will be used to test different
              models of CME eruptions.
