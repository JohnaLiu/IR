Proposal Number: DMS-0203320

This proposal deals
              with research on statistical inverse problems and point process methods in
              combinatorics. The first part of the proposal will involve work on non-standard
              asymptotics for likelihood ratio statistics and profile likelihoods,
              distribution theory for new limiting distributions, and new distribution theory
              for point processes. New computational algorithms will be investigated and
              comparisons of various competing algorithms for several inverse problems will
              be studied. Basic empirical process tools and methods will be developed and
              applied to statistical problems concerning semiparametric models and inverse
              problems. Applications include regression models for panel count data,
              bivariate interval censored data of several kinds, regression models for
              multivariate survival data, and studies of non- and semi-parametric maximum
              likelihood estimators used in AIDS research, two-phase data dependent designs,
              and animal carcinogenesis experiments.

The second part of the research will
              involve applications of point process methods to combinatorial problems,
              including study of the longest increasing sequence in a random permutation and
              related problems concerning random Young tableaux.
