TITLE: Testing UML Designs
PI: Robert France

The
              proposed research is concerned with developing mechanisms that support the
              generation of design-level test cases from UML design models.   The generated
              test cases are intended to be used in UML design reviews and inspections as a
              means for evaluating UML models and identifying errors
in software designs.
              

Developing a UML design testing approach and test generation support
              requires addressing the following issues:  (1) Providing an analyzable
              representation of UML models and test artifacts, and  (2) providing a flexible
              test generation mechanism.  To address these issues the proposed research
              effort is structured into the following research activities:

(1) Deriving
              test objectives from test-oriented formalizations of Class and Collaboration
              Diagrams. 

(2) Defining strategies for creating test objectives. These
              strategies will be expressed in terms of model coverage goals.

(3) Providing
              techniques that can be partially automated for  systematically generating test
              cases from test objectives.

(4) Assessing the effectiveness of the design
              testing technique developed in this research.

This research will produce
              results that can be used to develop industrial-strength techniques and tools
              for evaluating UML designs. The results produced by this research will also
              deepen understanding of how OO designs can be formally interpreted and
              evaluated.
