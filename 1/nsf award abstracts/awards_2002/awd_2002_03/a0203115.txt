This project supports the publication of an Earth Scientist's
              Periodic Table of the Elements and Their Ions (ESPTEI). The ESPTEI is a
              ground-breaking change in the way geochemistry is being taught and understood.
              The ESPTEI is a large format (14" x 36") color document that can be seen on the
              World-Wide Web at http://www.gly.uga.edu/railsback/PT.html. Unlike the
              traditional periodic table where elements are organized according to the nature
              and behavior of elemental (uncharged) forms of matter, the ESPTEI is organized
              by charged forms (for example, Si4+ and S2-). The table also shows some
              elements multiple times to account for their multiple naturally occurring
              valence states. This is done because earth scientists study matter in both
              oxidizing and reducing conditions. Another feature of this table is the
              placement of contours of equal ionic potential or charge density. Finally, the
              ESPTEI has symbols showing the abundances of ions or charged forms in soils and
              in natural waters, their roles as nutrients, and their occurrences in minerals,
              igneous rocks, and deep-sea nodules. Those symbols largely follow the contours
              of ionic potential over this newly-reorganized table, allowing many trends in
              mineralogy, aqueous geochemistry, igneous petrology, soil geochemistry,
              sedimentary geochemistry, nutrient chemistry, and even atmospheric chemistry to
              become apparent.
