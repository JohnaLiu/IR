Abstract    :
              This two-day symposium on self-assembled photonic band gap materials will take
              place at the Spring 2002 American Chemical Society Meeting in Orlando, FL.  The
              symposium will address a diverse array of subjects ranging from organic
              synthesis to optical characterization.  In order to maximize the benefit of
              this symposium, it will begin with three tutorial lectures that will head from
              conventional optics to a description of photonic materials.  The tutorials will
              give the participants the necessary background.  The organizers have invited a
              diverse array of speakers from industry and academia, including a number of
              Assistant Professors.  They will also encourage graduate students to present
              their latest results at the symposium.  The funds obtained from the National
              Science Foundation will be used primarily to support the participation of
              Assistant Professors and graduate students.
