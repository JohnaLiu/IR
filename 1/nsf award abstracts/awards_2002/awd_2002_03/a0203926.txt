              ABSTRACT DMS - 0203926.

The objective of this project is to study analytic
              and geometric aspects of 
Hamilton's Ricci flow of Riemannian metrics, and
              related topics. In particular, 
the principal investigator proposes to
              investigate injectivity radius estimates 
for solutions to the Ricci flow. The
              PI proposes to study
Li-Yau-Hamilton (Harnack) inequalities for both the Ricci
              flow and the 
linearized Ricci flow. The PI also proposes to study collapsing
              sequences of solutions 
to the Ricci flow and the related compactness theory.
              Finally, the PI proposes to 
study estimates for the linearized Ricci flow
              and
their applications. The PI will focus on dimension 3, where there are the
              
most tools available and the problems posed have the most topological
              applications.


The Ricci flow is an evolution equation which deforms
              geometric structures 
on surfaces and manifolds both improving and smoothing
              out the structures. 
It has been at the cutting edge of the recent rapid
              progress in geometric 
evolution equations and has greatly influenced the
              study of the mean curvature
flow and many other geometric evolution equations.
              The work on 
understanding the singularities which develop under the flow has
              led to the development 
of new and powerful analytic and geometric tools,
              which have found applications in the
study of many geometric evolution
              equations. Many phenomena are
modeled by geometric evolution equations, such
              as heat transfer, the 
evolution of interfaces between molten and solid metal,
              and the interfaces between ice 
and water. Geometric evolution equations are
              also used to smooth out images and 
have applications in computer vision.
