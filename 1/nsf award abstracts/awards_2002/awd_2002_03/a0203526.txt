Abstract    :
              This award funds a planning visit to Brazil for Dr. Derek Dunn-Rankin of the
              University of California-Irvine to meet  with Dr. Joao De Carvalho of the
              Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP) and to visit the Instituto Nacional de
              Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) to develop a research plan to experimentally analyze
              thermoacoustic oscillations in confined combustion systems. A better
              understanding of such systems could lead to improved heat transfer and lower
              pollutant levels.  The detailed experimental plan that will result from this
              planning visit could form the basis for a future U.S.-Brazil Cooperative
              Research proposal.
