Abstract    :
              This award supports collaboration between Dr. Shiferaw Berhanu of Temple
              University and Dr. Jorge G. Hounie of the Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos in
              Sao Carlos, Brazil to study a number of properties of solutions of systems of
              complex vector fields with smooth or real analytic coefficients. In cases to be
              considered, an integrability condition is always assumed to hold. These
              problems are motivated by classical results of holomorphic functions in one and
              several complex variables. Results from this research may have important
              applications to function theory in several variables and to the theory of
              linear partial differential equations.
