Abstract    :
              This research focuses on the exact study of the statistical mechanics of model
              systems.
Research concentrates on critical percolation in two-dimensions, and
              important and
extensively studied statistical system, and the phase transition
              of the farey fraction spin
chain, a new and interesting one-dimensional model
              with connections to multifractals and 
Monte Carol simulations, mathematically
              exact solutions of model statistical 
mechanical systems, and techniques from
              number theory.  The goal is to gain new
insights into, and understanding of,
              these systems.  An important feature of the project is
the use of techniques
              from pure mathematics and close collaboration with
mathematicians.
