Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to:
1.	Analyze AMANDA II data and a program, Eview, for muon
              propagation in ice.
2.	Develop and test a fused silica module.
3.	Develop a
              fluorescence data logger to be lowered at the time of drilling a hole in ice. 
              This device is to provide a way to characterize the optical property of ice as
              a function of depth.
Funding for the duration of three years is
              recommendation.  Funding level for years two and three will depend on IceCube
              funding.
