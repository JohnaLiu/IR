Abstract    :
              This project will develop a scalable parallel computing framework for high-end
              computational research, which will achieve scalability beyond tightly coupled
              Teraflop architectures, i.e., for distributed supercomputing on multiple
              Teraflop computers as well as on future Petaflop computers with deep memory
              hierarchy. To accomplish this goal, the PI will conduct the following research
              tasks: 

Topology-preserving computational-space decomposition to minimize
              the number of messages using a structured message-passing scheme;
              
Wavelet-based adaptive load balancing in dynamic, heterogeneous metacomputing
              environment using simulated annealing to minimize load imbalance and message
              sizes; 
Recursive and reconfigurable grouping of processors with message
              renormalization and computation/communication overlapping to hide latency at
              each grouping level; 
Spacefilling-curve-based adaptive data compression ---
              in situ processing of interoperable compressed data to reduce message sizes
              with user-controlled error bound. 

A suite of scalable scientific programs
              developed within the new framework will be disseminated as a
              computational-scientist's toolkit through a Web portal to have significant
              impacts on high-end computational research, including the design of quantum-dot
              architectures for future quantum computing.
