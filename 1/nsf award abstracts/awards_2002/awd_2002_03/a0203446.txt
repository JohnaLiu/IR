"Machine Learning Advances for Engineering Education"

This project, at
              the University of Central Florida (UCF), integrates research results from the
              theory and applications of Machine Learning into the Engineering/Computer
              Science curricula. Two new courses and several revised courses include material
              from Adaptive Reasoning Theory, Genetic Algorithms, Human Behavior
              Representation, and Simulation Meta-modeling. The objectives of this CRCD
              project include:  1. Incorporating current state-of-the-art Machine Learning
              research results into the undergraduate and first year graduate curriculum to
              enhance students' critical thinking, intellectual growth and communication
              skills, 2. Offering a unique curriculum, by traditional undergraduate
              standards, where the PIs integrate their current research results into the
              curriculum. This curriculum is timely and dynamic, reflecting the PIs' and the
              machine learning community's research interest changes with time, 3. Offering
              the opportunity to a multi-disciplinary group of students (spanning the
              spectrum of electrical, computer, industrial, civil, mechanical, and computer
              science students) to benefit from research and its transfer into curricula, 4.
              Assessing and evaluating the educational impact of the project through a
              sequence of carefully chosen evaluation instruments developed by an educational
              consultant, and 5. Disseminating the curriculum development efforts to a number
              of affiliate Universities.
