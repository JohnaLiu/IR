Abstract    :
               

This award provides funding for a three-year Combined Research-Curriculum
              Development (CRCD) program, entitled "Real-World Wireless Communications in the
              Graduate and Undergraduate Curriculum," at the University of Notre Dame, under
              the direction of Dr. Thomas E. Fuja. The overall objective of this project is
              to bring elements of the Notre Dame digital communications research and the
              capabilities created by the wireless facility, the WAND Lab, into the
              undergraduate and graduate electrical engineering curriculum at Notre Dame.
