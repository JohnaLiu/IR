ABSTRACT

Several topics
              in q-analysis will be studied. A family
of generalizations of the Gaussian
              integral is
considered which has several q's. These integrals are
closely
              related to the Rogers-Ramanujan identities, and
new results are found which
              are motivated by the integrals.
An investigation of the root system version of
              the integrals
will be undertaken. Some new classical
              q-orthogonal
polynomials, q-Taylor series and combinatorial
              enumeration
problems will also be considered.

One of the simplest types of
              functions is a polynomial.
More complicated functions such as sine,
              cosine,
or exponentials can be approximated accurately using polynomials.
The
              general theorem in calculus which allows such results is
called Taylor's
              theorem, and it is used in applications
throughout science. One of the objects
              of study in this proposal
is a generalized approximation result, a q-Taylor
              theorem.
It can be applied to functions currently under study in
mathematics
              and statistical physics.  Several related integrals,
derivatives, and
              polynomials are also studied.
