              Clusters

The promise of high-performance computing implicit in parallel
              computation has so far been realized in a limited range of applications, but
              parallelism in large distributed-memory systems is hampered by the cost of
              message passing.  Symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) clusters combine distributed
              memory with true shared memory access and offer the potential for effectively
              solving complex, irregular optimization problems with reduced message passing
              costs.  The proposed research is to extend work on high-performance SMP
              computation, using computational biology, to develop a hierarchical methodology
              for clusters of SMPs.  The postdoctoral research associate will develop and
              test the methodology, suited to future multilevel parallel architectures, using
              problems and algorithms from research in high-performance computational biology
              as test cases.
