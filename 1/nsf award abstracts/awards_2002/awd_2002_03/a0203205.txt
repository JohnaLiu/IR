The proposed work is centered on K(1)-local
              homotopy theory 
and its applications to algebraic K-theory. One goal of the
              
project is to compute the mod 2 homology of the general linear 
group of a
              number ring. A broader objective is a systematic 
study of K(1)-local homotopy
              theory from the perspective of 
Iwasawa theory, with a view toward
              applications to the algebraic
K-theory spectra of number rings.

One of the
              most striking features of modern mathematics is 
its essential unity. Time and
              again one finds that seemingly 
unrelated branches of the subject interact in
              unexpected ways. 
The interaction of of algebraic topology and number theory
              is 
a noteworthy example of this phenomenon. Number theory began 
as a
              "discrete" subject, then turned analytic in the 19th 
century and increasingly
              geometric in the 20th. In the last 
thirty years or so, algebraic topology
              (the study of properties
of geometric objects, such as curves and surfaces,
              that remain invariant under deformation) has entered more and more into
              number-theoretic questions. The proposed work will explore 
further the
              remarkable connections between these two subjects, 
by analyzing the topology
              of certain geometric objects that 
can be associated to classical
              number-theoretic data.
