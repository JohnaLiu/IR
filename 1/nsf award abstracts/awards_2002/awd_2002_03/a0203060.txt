CISE Postdoctoral
              Associates in Experimental Computer Science: Automating Development of
              Interactive Distributed Applications

Interactive distributed applications
              (IDAs) are software applications that involve direct interaction with users and
              are distributed across a computer network.  IDA development is complicated by
              application characteristics such as interactivity, concurrency,
              non-determinism, heterogeneity, and severe resource constraints. Current
              software development tools address some of these complications, but development
              environments supporting integrated use of IDA development tools are lacking. 
              The postdoctoral research associate will work on the integration and validation
              of Meridian, a collection of tools designed to help automate the development of
              IDAs.  Specifically, the associate will 1) research the automated generation
              and integration of  analysis tools that are easily and efficiently integrated
              into a comprehensive environment, and 2) perform case studies of different
              classes of IDAs and populate class-specific IDA information repositories for
              reuse.
