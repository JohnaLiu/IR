Abstract    :
              This project is an investigation of factors that influence the start and end of
              the rainy season in tropical South America and hence influence agricultural
              productivity and the availability of water resources.  The objectives are: (i)
              to determine the influence of large-scale circulation anomalies, especially
              those forced by interannual variations of sea-surface temperatures in the
              adjacent oceans, on the key thermal and dynamic factors that control the onset
              and demise of the rainy season over the northern part of South America, (ii) to
              explore how land-surface processes and bio-mass burning modify the atmospheric
              boundary layer conditions needed for the onset of the rainy season by
              influencing pre-seasonal climate conditions, (iii) to characterize the link
              between regional climates in tropical South America, Central and North America
              via cross-equatorial flow and to identify the underlying dynamic processes. 
              The approach to be taken consists of a diagnostic study of a number of data
              sets relevant to the climatology of the region.  The data include:  ECMWF
              reanalyses, South American rain gauge data, in situ surface fluxes and soil
              moisture from the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia,
              instantaneous cloud data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology
              Project, aerosol optical depth from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer, and
              the NASA-Ames 8-km Amazon Ecology Mapping data.
