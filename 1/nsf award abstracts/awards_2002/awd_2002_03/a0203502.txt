This award to University of California at San Diego will provide
              instrumentation for oceanographic research for use by the Oceanographic Data
              Facility of Scripps Institution of Oceanography, as well as specific
              instruments for use on the four research vessels operated by the institution,
              R/Vs Revelle, Melville, New Horizon and Sproul.  All four of these research
              vessels are operated by the university as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific instrumentation to be
              acquired includes a GPS unit for vessel attitude monitoring, a
              thermosalinograph, sixteen computers for shipboard use, two new CTD
              (conductivity-temperature-depth) systems with carousels for water sampling,
              three conductivity/temperature/pump sets for use with the CTDs, three new
              oxygen sensors, upgrades for autotitrator systems, and new cable and fairing
              for the towed, undulating vehicle system.  The shared-use instrumentation
              supported here will assist marine scientists conduct studies worldwide on SIO
              and other research vessels during 2002 and future years.
