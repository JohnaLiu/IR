Abstract    :
              EIA-0203960 Marty A. Humphrey University of Virginia Legion-G: Delivering a
              Scalable and Secure Programming Model for Grid Computing

To date, Grid
              computing lacks a secure, persistent, fault-tolerant, Grid-enabled object model
              that is standards-based and interoperable with the isolated Grid computing
              solutions that are emerging from the work in the Global Grid Forum. 
              Grid-enabled objects must be dynamically instantiated and located, and users
              and administrators need to be able to better visualize performance and
              debugging, and graphically move objects across Grid boundaries.  This project
              addresses these problems with three contributions.  First, the lack of
              flexibility will be solved via the creation of Legion-G, a revolutionary
              "applications-level" interface of Legion to Globus.  Second, new scheduling
              support for components across Grids will be developed.  This "Continuous
              Scheduling" modeling will facilitate faster customization and more powerful,
              dynamic control of Grid-based component applications, resulting in higher
              performance and productivity.  Third, the Grid Debugging Visualizer (GDV) will
              give Grid systems administrators and Grid users more precise, real-time
              information regarding the timing errors and functional errors of the
              component-based Grid computations.
