Abstract    :
              The SIAM project, DSWeb, will explore new ways of  communication via the web.
              DSWeb is an Internet portal with a goal to become the primary site for the
              organization and distribution of timely information about all aspects of
              dynamical systems and its  applications. DSWeb will promote research and the
              exchange of ideas across a broad, but focused community.
     
DSWeb will not
              only serve the dynamical systems community. It will  also serve the purpose of
              outreach to other sciences and to a general scientifically literate audience.
              Aspects of DSWeb are intended to reach this broad audience. It will be offered
              with free access.
