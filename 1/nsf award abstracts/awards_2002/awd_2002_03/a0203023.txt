The principle investigator proposes to
              study the interplay between the
geometry and the analysis on complete Kaehler
              manifolds. The focus will be
linear and nonlinear analysis on such manifolds.
              The main tool is solving
the linear equation, such as the Poisson equation and
              Poincare-Lelong
equation, and the nonlinear equations such as the Kaehle-Ricci
              flow. The
goal is to understand the space of holomorphic functions
              (plurisubharmonic
functions), the interplay between the geometry and the
              function theory and
applying the results to the uniformization of complete
              Kaehler manifolds
with nonnegative curvature.

The manifold is the space
              where every physical event happens. The
global analysis on manifolds studies
              the overall properties of the
manifolds by piecing together the local
              information. Kaehler manifolds are
the basic block in the universe model
              according to the 
 string theory. The proposed study
has close connection
              with the theory of general relativity and string
theory. The nonlinear
              differential equations studied in the proposal have
applications in the study
              of the structure of complicated molecules,
liquid-gas boundary, and even the
              large scale networks.
