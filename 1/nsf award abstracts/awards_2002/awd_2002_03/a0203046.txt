Abstract    :
              A variety of astronomical systems will be studied. These include modeling the
              dynamical evolution of high mass binary star systems in star clusters,
              simulating the formation of binaries containing a neutron star or black hole,
              modeling the population of close white dwarf binaries, studying the inspiral of
              compact objects into central supermassive black holes, and studying possible
              background gravitational radiation due to non-standard model physics in the
              early universe.
This research will be carried out under the auspices of the
              Center for Gravitational Wave Physics since all of the research topics are
              important in understanding the nature of sources of gravitational radiation and
              their likely strength and rate of occurrence. Detection strategies for
              gravitational wave detectors require such information.
