Abstract    :
              Dr. Driscoll and the Co-PI Dr. Ceccio have developed a time-resolved
              cinema-PIV(particle image velocity) system that is capable of acquiring 8,000
              PIV images/second.  In the current proposal, they propose to use this new
              instrumentation to study the characteristics of a turbulent jet, more
              specifically, the temporal structure and evolution of eddies and their
              relationship to the generation of subgrid stresses and dissapation.  The
              experiments will consist of issuing a water jet into a co-flowing stream in a
              water tunnel.  The broader impact of this proposal will be to improve our
              ability to develop better subgrid scale models for the prediction of the
              characteristics of turbulent flows, and in the training of graduate students in
              this advance instrumentation technique.  Knowledge gained in this research will
              be useful in the development of 3D cinema-PIV system.
