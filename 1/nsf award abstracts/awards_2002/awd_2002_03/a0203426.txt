In a semidefinite
              programming (SDP) problem, a linear function of a symmetric matrix variable X
              is minimized subject to linear equality constraints on X and the essential
              constraint that X be positive semidefinite.  Many mathematical optimization
              problems can be cast as SDP problems including linear programs, convex
              quadratic problems with convex quadratic inequality constraints, matrix norm
              minimization problems, and a variety of maximum and minimum eigenvalue
              problems. In addition, SDP has many applications in combinatorial optimization,
              engineering, statistics, and robust optimization.

Today, there are numerous
              algorithms and codes available for solving SDPs, and these methods can be
              loosely grouped into two classes: second-order interior-point (IP) methods and
              first-order nonlinear programming (NLP) methods. The choice of which class to
              use for a particular application is determined primarily by
problem size ---
              second-order IP methods are more efficient on small- to medium-scale problems
              while first-order NLP methods are better for large-scale problems.
