Abstract    :
              Solar energetic particle (SEP) events associated with coronal mass ejections
              (CMEs) will be studied by developing a detailed convection-diffusion model of
              particle transport and acceleration in the solar corona and in interplanetary
              space. The model results will be compared with energetic particle population
              observations obtained at 1 AU, using the ACE and Wind data, and at several AU,
              using the Ulysses data. The focus of the effort will be on the low-energy (20
              keV/nuc to 5 MeV/nuc) particles which remain poorly understood since they
              interact more readily with entrained solar wind structures. Low-energy
              particles are more strongly affected by the convection, wave-particle
              interactions, and adiabatic deceleration. Accordingly, these transport effects,
              as well as those associated with continuous acceleration, will be incorporated
              into the modeling effort. Because energetic particles precede the arrival of
              the CME by at least one day, characterizing these SEPs can potentially aid in
              the formulation of space weather forecasts.
