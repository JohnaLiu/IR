Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks to extend the PARINT software package for parallel
              integration, furnishing it with the characteristics of a Problem Solving
              Environment. The main goals of the project are to offer a complete set of tools
              for composing problem secifications, compiling and running applications, while
              providing state-of-the-art problem solving power to the end user. To this end,
              we propose adding new techniques for extending the PARINT problem domain, e.g.,
              to allow for a variety of integration regions, high dimensions, and singular
              integrated behavior. These include a transformation interface, new distributed
              Quasi-Monte Carlo strategies and extapolation methods.  Specific contributions
              are in the development of numerical techniques and evaluation of parallel
              integration algorithms. Important issues in parallel and distributed
              computations such as load balancing are addressed, with an emphasis on loosely
              coupled and heterogeneous systems. Other contributions are in the areas of user
              interfaces, visualization and web computing.
