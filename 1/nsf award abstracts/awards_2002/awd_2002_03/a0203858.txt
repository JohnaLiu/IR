This research addresses the stability
              of weak solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws and related problems in
              kinetic theory.  Stability will be studied by constructing explicit Lyapunov
              functionals.  Specific goals are: (i) establish the stability of weak solutions
              to hyperbolic conservation laws with geometric source terms and certain kinetic
              models with collision terms;  (ii) study the nonlinear stability of shock waves
              of the Boltzmann equation with boundary effects, and hydrodynamic limits of
              some collisional kinetic equations.

Hyperbolic conservation laws with
              geometric source terms appear in many physical situations, such as shallow
              water flow through a channel, nozzle flow through a duct, and self-similar gas
              flow in multi-dimensional Euler equations.  The issue of stability of solutions
              is important in the design of systems modeled by these equations, which include
              aircraft and space shuttle engines.  The Boltzmann equation and the
              Smoluchowski equation are fundamental equations in kinetic theory. Stability
              analysis for these equations can be used in development of accurate methods for
              numerical simulation of the corresponding physical systems.
