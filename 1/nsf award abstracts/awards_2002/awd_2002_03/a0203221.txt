Abstract    :
              
The research builds upon previous work in the area of protein diffusion on the
              surface of erythrocytes. The investigator will develop numerical algorithms to
              efficiently evolve the shape of the cell membrane as a function of time.
              Thermal fluctuations insure that the membrane's dynamics will be stochastic and
              it is anticipated, on the basis of preliminary results, that these fluctuations
              will be sufficiently large in amplitude and sufficiently long in duration to
              account for the escape of band 3 protein from the cytoskeletal "corrals "on the
              surface of the red blood cell. The simulations may provide a microscopic
              justification for the choice of empirical parameters in earlier studies, or, it
              may prove necessary to include the dynamics of the cytoskeleton to achieve
              agreement with experiments. In either eventuality, the investigation will
              quantify the relative importance of membrane fluctuations and cytoskeletal
              dynamics on protein mobility. The algorithms developed will be of use in future
              studies of cell motility and other biological behavior that is dependent upon
              dynamic membrane fluctuations.
