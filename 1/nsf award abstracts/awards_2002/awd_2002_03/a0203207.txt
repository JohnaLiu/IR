Mueller

This U.S.-Mexico award will support Dr. Peter Mueller of the
              University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, in a research collaboration
              with Dr. Andres Christen of CIMAT in Guanajuato, Mexico.  The researchers
              intend to work on sequential design approaches in the context of sampling
              designs for estimating species diversity and for inference about areas of high
              habitat potential. Appropriate probability models for these applications will
              involve optimal sequential design strategies, using a hybrid strategy of
              reduced action spaces and Monte Carlo simulations.

The collaborators will
              bring complementary skills to the project with the Mexican collaborators
              contributing expertise in inference for biodiversity, and the U.S.
              collaborators contributing research focus and experience in simulation-based
              optimal Bayesian design. Both investigators also have extensive research
              experience in Bayesian data analysis, modeling, and simulation. The involvement
              of graduate students will broaden the basis of the collaboration.
