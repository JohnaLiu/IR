Stavros Garoufalidis plans to study
              applications of quantum field theory
to 3-dimensional topology and geometry.
              This work is motivated by 
the Chern-Simons path integral, its exact
              computation (in terms of 
quantum invariants of knots and 3-manifolds) and its
              perturbative expansion.
Quantum field theory predicts that invariants of knots
              and 3-manifolds which
are defined via cut-and-paste topology carry geometric
              information of the
underlying structures; in particular of the fundamental
              group of a 3-manifold
and its representations to Lie groups. A key question is
              to recover the
geometric information (described in terms of surgery theory or
              Riemannian
hyperbolic geometry) by taking an appropriate limit of quantum
              invariants.

The above mentioned relation between physics and mathematics has
              deep roots
in the past century. Mathematics has strongly influenced Physics,
              as is 
evident from the development of Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics and
              General
Relativity, which describe our world in three quite different
              scales.
Knotedness is a fundamental property that binds fundamental
              particles
together, but also the DNA molecule.
The most recent interaction
              between 3-dimensional quantum field theory and 
topology aims at describing
              knotedness in terms of geometric and 
topological language.  Topology could be
              a unifying language to describe
the building blocks of physics, but also of
              life itself.
