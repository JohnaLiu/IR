Abstract    :
              The investigator proposes to study the renormalization of period integrals 
on
              GL(n).  More specifically, this project concerns the development of a 
theory
              of truncation of GL(n) Eisenstein series, thereby leading to a 
definition of
              renormalized torus integrals.  Such results in turn make it 
possible to
              compute the polar divisor of the integrals and therefore to 
find unexpected
              functional equations of renormalized period integrals of 
Eisenstein
              series.

This is a project in Number Theory, one of the oldest branches of
              
mathematics.  The foundations of Number Theory lie in the study of the
              
positive integers.  Some basic objects that have emerged in Number Theory
              
are automorphic forms, objects that possess surprising symmetries.  This
              
project studies certain integrals of particular automorphic forms called
              
Eisenstein series.  These integrals, if interpreted in the usual way, are
              
infinite, so part of the proposed research deals with reinterpreting these
              
integrals, using renormalization to give them a definite meaning.  This has
              
already been carried out by the investigator in a special case, which gave
              
rise to a relationship with another renormalized integral that was
              
developed in a different fashion.  More striking, however, was the
              
occurrence of an unexpected symmetry in four dimensions.  The aim of this
              
project is to extend this technique of renormalization to the most general
              
case, and to look for generalizations of this unexpected phenomenon.
