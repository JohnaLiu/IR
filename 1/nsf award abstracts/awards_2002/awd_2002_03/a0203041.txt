Abstract    :
              In this project funded by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program of
              the Chemistry Division, Herman will develop numerically efficient and accurate
              semiclassical methods to evaluate quantum transition probabilities and
              correlation functions in nonequilibrium condensed-phase, gas-phase, and
              molecular-beam systems.  These density-evolution methods require consideration
              of the full quantum nature of the evolution only for times on the order of the
              loss of quantum phase coherence.  These methods are systematically correctable
              and provide an estimate of the calculational error at each level of
              approximation.  The procedures will be tested on simple model problems for
              which exact quantum results can be obtained and then on problems for which
              experimental data is available.  The results of calculations using these
              methods will also be compared with those obtained using other computational
              methods.

At a time when experimental methods are able to characterize
              increasingly fast processes, it is imperative to develop theoretical formalisms
              that are capable of describing such processes.  The work proposed here
              addresses that need.  It further promises to provide a framework for analyzing
              and interpreting ultra-fast nonequilibrium processes in excited-state systems. 
               The planned extension of the methods to systems that are far from equilibrium
              will allow simulation of new classes of chemical reactions.
