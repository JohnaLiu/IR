Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for FY2002.  The fellowship supports research and training at the
              postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational,
              computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the
              fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a
              career in biological informatics in which research and education will be
              integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics
              at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through
              these fellowships will play important roles in training the future
              workforce.

The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled
              "Modeling the genetics of species using biological informatics: interactions of
              gene flow, selection, and dispersal."  This simulation model uses parameters
              compiled from biological databases to evaluate the role of gene flow, selection
              coefficients and dispersal on the rate of allelic spread across subdivided
              populations.  The research provides information on how species may remain
              cohesive at only a handful of major loci while simultaneously diverging at many
              minor loci, and has implications for explaining the relationship between macro-
              and microevolution.
