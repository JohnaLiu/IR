Abstract    :
              The research focuses on two areas of short-pulse laser plasma interactions;
              first - pulse wavelength tuning using a fs-laser produced semiconductor plasma
              and a 'clean' test of the proposed Superradiant Amplification (SRA) of a
              fs-laser pulse in a plasma.  A semiconductor plasma composed of electron-hole
              pairs will allow the PI to avoid some of the difficulties that have plaqued
              recent work on this topic.
