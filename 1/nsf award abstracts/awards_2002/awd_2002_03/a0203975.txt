ABSTRACT

The study of
              2-dimensional dynamical systems is an active area of
research. Families such
              as the Henon and Lozi families have been
intensively studied in recent years
              and many beautiful results
have been obtained. However, we are still far from
              having a
complete understanding of them. In dimension 1, due to the
efforts
              of many researchers during the past two decades, there is
an almost complete
              theory. Parallels and differences between the
dynamics of families in
              dimensions 1 and 2 have been exploited by
several authors. The past work of
              the PI includes the development
of a 2-dimensional analogue of Milnor and
              Thurston's kneading
theory and the study of braids and braid forcing. The
              present
project proposes to further the study of dynamics in dimension 2
as
              well as some aspects of braid theory and Teichmuller theory.
The main topics
              to be studied are: Horseshoe braids,
Generalized pseudo-Anosov maps and
              piecewise linear models for 
diffeomorphisms in dimension 2, Real and Complex
              Henon maps and
the Pruning Front Conjecture, Renormalization in dimension 2,
              and
some aspects of infinite-dimensional Teichmuller Theory.


Dynamical
              systems is the branch of mathematics that describes
systems that evolve in
              time. Typical examples are planetary
motion, population patterns, weather
              prediction or the  economy.
Since Newton, it is believed that simple
              mathematical laws are
capable of describing the long term behavior of many of
              such
systems. The problem is that often such simple mathematical
laws lead to
              extremely complicated long time behavior.
