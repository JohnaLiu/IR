Abstract    :
              This proposal supports meetings and other activities of the National Academy of
              Science's Board on Physics and Astronomy (BPA).  The role of the Board is to
              identify important new developments at the scientific forefronts, foster
              interactions with other fields, strengthen connections to technology and
              facilitate effective service to the nation by the scientific community. 
              Members of the BPA are drawn from universities, industry and federal
              laboratories.  Meetings are devoted to evaluating activities being carried out
              under its auspices, discussing critical issues and developing new initiatives. 
              In general, studies initiated by the BPA focusing on particular areas of
              physics and astronomy are carried out by ad hoc groups of experts in those
              areas.  Reports produced by these groups will have considerale impact in
              shaping the future directions of the field.
