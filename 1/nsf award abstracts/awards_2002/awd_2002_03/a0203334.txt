              Abstract for 0203334:


This award provides support for a one-day workshop of
              separations specialists to identify needs and opportunities for research on
              capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide.  Carbon dioxide is the leading
              greenhouse gas that may be responsible for global warming.  Much carbon dioxide
              is produced by power plants and by transportation as well as industrial
              operations.  To deal with the potential treats of global warming it is
              desirable to develop efficient and economical methods for separating and
              stabilizing carbon dioxide so that discharges to the atmosphere can be
              controlled.  The experts attending the workshop will provide guidance to NSF
              regarding appropriate research investments in this area.

The workshop is
              being organized by the University of Colorado.  It will be held at Tulane
              University during the week of March 11, 2002.  It is planned to coincide with
              an AIChE conference that will offer a symposium on global warming.  Thus, a
              number of experts will be available at that site.  It is expected that staff
              from DOE will also participate so the workshop should provide an opportunity
              for coordination of research efforts by the two agencies.  The impact will be
              to enhance development of greenhouse-gas-control technology for the protection
              of the global environment.
