Fluid mechanics is an important
              subject that plays a central role in modern applied mathematics.  Many
              phenomena in fluids, such as turbulence and intermittency, are still understood
              poorly even at the physical level, and as such provide a rich source of
              mathematical problems.  In this project we will study mathematically the
              transport properties of a randomly stirred fluid.  In earlier work, the
              principal investigator and collaborators were able to deduce a great deal of
              information about the transport properties and induced intermittency in a
              particular model of fluid flow, using ideas of asymptotic analysis,
              semiclassical eigenvalue problems, and probability.  In current work we extend
              these ideas to more complex flow fields, where exact solution formulae are not
              available.  In addition to the above techniques, we intend to make use of the
              Donsker-Varadhan theory, giving large deviations principles for quantities
              defined via Feynman-Kac integrals.

The goal of this project is to bridge the
              gap between physical understanding and mathematical proof in the area of fluid
              transport.  At present only a few very simple models for the transport of a
              passive quantity, such as a dye, by a turbulent fluid are understood in a
              rigorous mathematical sense.  By extending the mathematical understanding to
              more complex models, we will clarify the question of what properties these
              simple models do and do not share with the more realistic flows of interest to
              scientists and engineers.  We also hope to expand the physical understanding of
              transport properties, which is still far from complete.
