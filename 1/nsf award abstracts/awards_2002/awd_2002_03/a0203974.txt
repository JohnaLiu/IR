Abstract    :
              EIA-0203974 Chrisochoides, Nikos P. College of William and Mary  Mesh Generation
              and Optimistic Computation on the Grid . The goal of this proposal is to
              investigate exactly these issues using an identified application as a test
              case.  Mesh generation and dynamic manipulation is an integral part of many
              important scientific computing applications and must take place on the same
              platform with the rest of the application.  Mesh generation is a
              memory-intensive application with major impact on the overall performance of
              the end-to-end field simulations-an important class of applications that could
              benefit greatly from a grid platform.  Traditional approaches for generating,
              partitioning, and placing very large meshes have tow weakness when used on
              grids:  (i) I/O and data movement due to mesh re-partitioning, for adaptive
              applications, is prohibitively expensive, and (ii) there is a trade-off between
              the performance of field solvers and the quality of the resulting elements and
              partitions.
