Abstract    :
              This grant supports the management of the 2002 US/Africa/South American
              Materials Workshop on Civil Infrastructure and Manufacturing that will be held
              January 6-7, 2002 in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  This international workshop will
              host eleven scientists and engineers from North America and none of their
              counterparts from Africa, South America, Asia and Europe.  On the first day,
              invited papers on materials for infrastructure and development, and papers on
              materials and manufacturing are scheduled.  The second half-day will focus on
              discussion, planning future interactions and collaborations, and drafting a
              workshop report.  In addition to reporting the workshop results by
              publications, they will immediately be reported to the broader research
              community attending the 2002 National Science Foundation's Design, Service and
              Manufacturing Grantees and Research Conference at the same venue on January
              7-10, 2002.

Developing the infrastructure to support the global practice of
              engineering and manufacturing is a key issue for the economic well being of all
              nations.  This group of experts from around the world will advise and develop a
              joint agenda on collaboration among nations to provide the technical and
              educational infrastructure needed for the 21st century.
