Abstract    :
              The 2002 Japan-USA Symposium on Flexible Automation co-organized by Georgia Tech
              will be held in Hiroshima, Japan, July 15-17, 2002.  The symposium will consist
              of three days of technical presentations, panel discussions, and keynote
              speeches, followed by tours to major university research laboratories and
              industry production facilities in Japan.  The financial assistance will make it
              possible for many promising U.S. researchers such as faculty, postdoctoral
              fellows, and graduate students to attend the conference and learn about
              research, development, and implementation of flexible automation technologies
              in Japan.  It will also enhance the ability of the symposium organizers to
              attract top university researchers in U.S. to contribute to the symposium.
