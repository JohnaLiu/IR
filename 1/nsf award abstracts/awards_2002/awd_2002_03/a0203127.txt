Title:   Factors Concerning
              Recruitment and Retention of Women Graduate
Students in Computer Science and
              Engineering

This ITWF award provides support to the Computing Research
              Association
(CRA) to study an important aspect of the largest
              under-represented group
in the IT workforce, the graduate education of women. 
              Using experience
gained in a previous Best Practice Report (Janice Cuny and
              William Aspray,
"Recruitment and Retention of Women Graduate Students in
              Computer Science
and Engineering", Computing Research Association, Washington,
              DC 2001) on
recruiting and retaining women in computer science and engineering
              (CS&E)
graduate school, the project will study U.S. CS&E graduate programs
              in
order to identify and quantify links between the program's recruitment
              and
retention practices and their outcomes.

Results expected from the study
              include a description and assessment of the
existing recruitment and retention
              practices in 50 CS&E departments with
doctoral programs; a measure of the
              impact recruitment practices have on
the female proportion of new students
              enrolled; a measure of the impact
retention practices have on the female
              proportion of students retained
through the doctorate; a set of materials that
              departments can use to make
self-assessments; an evaluation of the
              effectiveness and comprehensiveness
of the practices recommended in the Best
              Practices Report; and findings
that can be generalized on the link between
              recruitment and retention
practices and their outcomes with respect to female
              graduate students.
