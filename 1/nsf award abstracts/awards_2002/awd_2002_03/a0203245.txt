Abstract    :
              Dr. Braja K. Mandal, Department of Chemistry, Illinois Institute of Technology
              is jointly supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
              Chemistry program in the Division of Chemistry and the Solid State Chemistry
              program in the Division of Materials Research to create new photonic materials
              based on the self-assembly of metallo-organic building blocks into organized
              nanoscale assemblies.  This research builds on his recent construction of fused
              multi-ring phthalocyanines ligands by a Diels-Alder reaction between a diene
              bearing solubilizing groups and a quinone dienophile containing sites for the
              incorporation of nitrile groups.  These phthalocyanines will contain helicene,
              perylene and benzoperylene groups to solubilize them in organic solvents,
              facilitate self-assembly and promote linear and nonlinear optical properties. 
              These highly conjugated molecules will be capable of modification to tune their
              optical, and electron and energy transfer properties.

New cyclic molecules
              with high aromaticity will be prepared to facilitate self-assembly into
              aggregates capable of electron and energy transfer that can be integrated into
              electronic devices.
