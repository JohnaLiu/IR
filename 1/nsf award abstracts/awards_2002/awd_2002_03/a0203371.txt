Abstract    :
              This workshop brings together researchers and government officials engaged in
              investigative, response, and recovery activities at the World Trade Center
              (WTC) site of the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. The workshop dates
              are December 12-13, 2001 and the location is New York City, reflecting its
              sponsor and coordinating organization for the WTC research efforts: the
              NSF-supported Institute for Civil Infrastructure Systems, housed at New York
              University's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.

The workshop's goals
              are to enable information sharing with the aim of identifying technological,
              economic, and social research areas to pursue; potential collaborators or
              partners; gaps of knowledge that new research must address, and areas of
              research and participation that will not be productive nor useful. Outputs from
              the workshop will include 1) a web site resource for researchers; 2)
              preliminary findings papers from the participants; and 3) a summary of the
              research themes and input from decision-makers , which will also be
              disseminated on the web.
