              Postdoctoral Associates in Experimental Computer Science: Low-Level
              Optimizations for Next-Generation Disk Drives

File input/output (I/O) has
              traditionally been a performance problem for several applications.  The
              proposed research seeks to optimize the performance of file I/O operations by
              taking advantage of next-generation disk devices (i.e., devices with embedded
              and programmable high-performance processors). The postdoctoral research
              associate will be involved with the introduction and evaluation of a new
              device-level architecture, new disk controller software, and modifications to
              standard host operating systems.  The expected outcomes are performance
              improvements for a wide spectrum of disk workloads, ranging from random and
              small file accesses to large sequential accesses.  Evaluations will employ
              combinations of detailed simulations and actual implementations along with
              native executions of disk-bound applications (e.g., video-on-demand, data
              mining).
