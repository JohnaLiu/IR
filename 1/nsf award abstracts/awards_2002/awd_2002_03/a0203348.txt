Abstract    :
              The PIs will carry out a swath bathymetry survey of the southern Gulf of
              California, obtain 3.5 kHz, magnetic and gravity profiles and collect dredge
              samples of the volcanic basement.  The objectives are to test hypotheses
              concerned with the generic problems of how continental rifts are segmented
              tectonically and whether this relates to asymmetries of faulting, how rift
              propagation occurs tectonically and what type(s) of magmatism accompanies
              continental break-up and earlist seafloor spreading.   The Gulf of California
              is a MARGINS' focus site and this study will complement other research being
              carried out and planned for this region.
