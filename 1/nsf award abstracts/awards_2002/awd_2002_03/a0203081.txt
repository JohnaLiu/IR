Abstract    :
              The International Children's Digital Library requests funds for a series of 
              stakeholder
meetings. The purpose of the meetings is to explore and develop
              strategies for implementing a
comprehensive digital library of children's
              literature. The Children's Library is dedicated to
providing worldwide digital
              access to children's literature. The meetings will be held in conjunction with
              The Library of Congress'  Special Collection Division. There will be six
              meetings focusing on specific interests: writers, librarians, publishers,
              children's advocates, technologists, and a summary meeting.
The meetings will
              be held between January and June 2002 at The Library of Congress
in Washington
              D.C.
