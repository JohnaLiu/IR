TITLE: CISE
              Postdoctoral Associates in Experimental Computer Science: Programming
              Entertainment Robots

To make humanoid robots a viable alternative for small
              scale entertainment applications, easier ways of programming them are needed. 
              They must have a natural and entertaining style of motion and often require
              substantial motion databases to ensure a sufficient variety of behaviors.  One
              potential solution to this problem is to use human motion data as the source of
              joint trajectories.  Automatic techniques for human motion data use would
              provide the variety of motion that is required for compelling robotic
              performances.  The postdoctoral associate will develop techniques that will
              allow human motion data to be used to control a wide variety of humanoid and
              entertainment robots and simulations.  This project will involve significant
              experimentation both in the development of optimization techniques and in the
              construction and control of physical robots.  The research will combine the
              expertise of the postdoctoral associate in dynamics, planning and motion
              filtering with the principal investigator's experience in simulation, control
              systems for human motion, and processing motion capture data.
