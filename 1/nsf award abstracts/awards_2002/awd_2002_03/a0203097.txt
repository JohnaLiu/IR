Abstract    :
              This RUI project is a collaborative study of two issues in growth of thin films
              on Group IV semi-conductor surfaces, i.e., on silicon and germanium. A team of
              four researchers at Bradley Univer-sity will address growth and
              characterization of ultra thin metallic films on silicon single crystal
              surfaces, and electron and photon assisted deposition of SiGe alloy films on
              Si(100) and Ge(100) surfaces under very low thermal budget conditions. Issues
              to be explored include electrical con-ductivity in ultra-thin metallic films on
              silicon as well as electromigration effects which may ac-company high current
              densities in such films. Also, fundamental issues of electron and photon driven
              processes in adsorbates which may serve as precursors to growth of SiGe alloy
              films will be studied.

The project addresses fundamental research
              issues in topical areas of materials science having technological relevance.
              Undergraduate students will play a primary role in the project, with
              op-portunities for research integrated directly into their academic program.
              The research program will provide access to state-of-the-art surface science
              equipment and unique opportunities for un-dergraduates to participate in and
              develop skills in exciting areas of materials science at the na-noscale level.
              An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, and
              the integration of research and education.
