Abstract    :
              This U.S.-Czech mathematics project is a cooperative effort between Thomas Lada
              at North Carolina State University and James Stasheff of the University of
              North Carolina with their counterpart in Prague, Martin Markl at the
              Mathematical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences.  Their goal is to
              clarify the homotopy invariance properties of various algebraic structures.  To
              do so they intend to utilize operads to study the question of homotopy
              invariance in several algebraic settings.  While homotopy invariant structures
              in the topological setting have been well studied, similar questions in
              algebraic settings still require attention.  The problems to be investigated by
              this U.S.-Czech team deal with the category of strongly homotopy algebras and
              their homotopy theoretic properties.  If successful, their investigation will
              integrate these ideas with several sophisticated algebraic structures that
              arise in mathematical physics.  Results should improve the theoretical
              underpinning for cross-disciplinary advances in perturbation theory and
              deformation quantization.        

This international project in topology
              fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling
              experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary
              talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and
              competence.
