The work of
              this proposal can be divided into three categories: (1) the study of dual
              representations of
the tangent space of a curve and surface, (2) the
              application of these dual representations to the computation
of bitangency,
              and (3) the application of bitangency to several problems in geometric
              modeling, computer
graphics and robotics such as visibility, lighting and
              motion.
The problem that binds together these areas of study is bitangency.
              There are basically three bitangent
structures: the bitangent line (a line
              that is tangent to two curves), the bitangent plane (a plane that
is tangent
              totwo surfaces), and the bitangent developable (the envelope of a familyof
              bitangent planes).
While the tangent is important in the analysis of
              individual curves and surfaces in isolation, the bitangent
is important in the
              analysis of collections of curves and surfaces, since it relates two curves or
              two surfaces.
As the analysis of large scenes becomes increasingly important,
              the bitangent becomes an important tool.
