              ABSTRACT - DMS 0203527

Geometric tomography uses data concerning sections by
              planes and
projections on planes of geometric objects to obtain
              information
about these objects.  The latter include general compact
              sets,
but often they are convex bodies, polytopes, star-shaped bodies,
or
              finite sets.  One advantage of this setting is that it becomes
more probable
              that inverse problems have a unique solution.
Generally, the a priori
              knowledge that the unknown object is of
uniform density can be exploited to
              retrieve more information
than would otherwise be possible.  This can lead to
              algorithms
that are more effective when few measurements are available,
              and
less sensitive to measurement errors or noise.  Geometric
tomography has
              links to functional analysis, convex geometry,
Minkowski geometry, and
              combinatorics. The project will continue
the development of geometric
              tomography.  New directions include
an extension of Lutwak's dual
              Brunn-Minkowski theory by the
introduction of moments of sets; work towards a
              coherent discrete
Brunn-Minkowski theory that applies to finite sets, with
              volume
replaced by cardinality; and an investigation into the
possibility of
              a Brunn-Minkowski theory for capacity. In related
applications, the plan is to
              consolidate links between geometric
tomography and a practical method called
              local stereology, and to
solve an inverse problem concerning finite sets with
              an
application to medical imaging. New discoveries about
intersection bodies
              are anticipated, with an application to the
reconstruction of star bodies from
              the volumes of their sections
through the origin. Also included is a program
              designed to
stimulate undergraduate research.

CAT scanners are machines
              that save lives daily.  They take
X-rays in a number of different directions,
              and synthesize the
information to create an image of a two-dimensional section
              of
part of the body.  The mathematics behind this process is
              called
computerized tomography.  It is very successful, but not perfect;
the
              reconstructed image is only approximate, and to get a better
picture with the
              same procedure one has to take more X-rays,
causing greater expense and
              likelihood of side effects.  In
geometric tomography, only homogeneous objects
              are allowed - the
density of the object is the same everywhere inside it. 
              An
example from medicine would be a bone or a kidney.  One can use
this
              information to find better reconstruction procedures.  The
scope of geometric
              tomography is actually much wider.  Any
measurement involving sections of a
              homogeneous object by lines
or planes or its shadows on lines or planes can be
              considered.
Because of this, it has many links to other areas, both
              in
mathematics (there is a large overlap with convex geometry, the
geometry
              of shapes without holes or dents) and outside.  For
example, a new technique
              called local stereology depends on
measurements of planar sections of
              biological tissue; each section
passes through a fixed point, usually the
              nucleus of a cell, and
the measurements can be made optically rather than
              physically.
This project continues the development of several aspects of
              the
mathematics of geometric tomography. Also included is a program
designed
              to stimulate undergraduate research.
