Abstract    :
              
This project is continuing a professional development model that is increasing
              the successful participation of community colleges and community college
              faculty in NSF programs. The Council for Resourcement Development (CRD) is
              building upon its existing regional conferences to offer a series of workshops
              designed to: familiarize faculty with NSF programs in general, showcase
              regional NSF funded projects and the faculty conducting those projects, and
              offer a workshop on proposal development strategies specific to NSF. The
              objectives and activities are to: 1) Provide coordination for workshop
              development and implementation at the regional level, 2) Recruit faculty to
              attend the workshops who have not yet received grant awards fromNSF, and 3)
              Evaluate the workshops with particular emphasis on the longitudinal outcomes.
              Follow-up activities with faculty are designed to increase grant submissions to
              the National Science Foundation. An increased emphasis is placed on attracting
              and assisting colleges in regions that have been underrepresented in the
              submission of grant applications to NSF. Longitudinal evaluation on grant
              submissions and awards are also being implemented.
