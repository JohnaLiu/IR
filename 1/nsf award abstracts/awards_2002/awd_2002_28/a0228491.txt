Abstract    :
              This pilot project involves the design and assessment of one prototype
              Calibrated Peer Review assignment on earthquakes and to evaluate its impact on
              student learning in two sections of Geology 100 at Iowa State Unversity in Fall
              2002. Calibrated Peer Review (CPR) is a computer-assisted essay writing,
              reading and assessment tool established by a consortium of six institutions in
              California and is currently being used by more than one hundred chemistry
              departments at colleges and universities nationwide. CPR is a web-based tool
              that facilitates student learning by writing about significant topics in a
              course. This prototype, if successful, will lead to the creation of a library
              of CPR assignments for the Earth sciences.
