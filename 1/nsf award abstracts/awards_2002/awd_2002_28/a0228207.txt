Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative research award involving the University of Texas at
              Dallas and Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.  The
              investigators will use data from the SuperDARN radar network and the Defense
              Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) to study convection in the high
              latitude ionosphere.  Both the SuperDARN radars and the DMSP spacecraft make
              routine measurements of ionospheric plasma motion, but both suffer from
              temporal and spatial limitations in their coverage.  The study will begin with
              the calibration and validation of the two data sets, leading to the development
              of techniques to reconcile the observations.  Once that is complete, combined
              data sets will be used to study the ionospheric response to changes in the
              interplanetary magnetic field (IMF).  Specific questions to be addressed are
              the saturation of the cross polar cap potential when the IMF is southward, the
              response time of the convection to changes in the IMF, and convection patterns
              when the IMF is strongly northward.  This work will aid in the development of
              space weather models which are used to predict conditions in the space
              environment that affect technological systems, such as electric power,
              navigation, and communication.
