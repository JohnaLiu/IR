This grant provides support for a workshop to discuss the 
              desirability and feasibility of creating a broadly representative and inclusive
              professional organization for the environmental engineering profession.
              Specific objectives are to (1) build concensus towards broadly recognizing the
              need for a professional society for environmental engineers that is not based
              on restricted membership, (2) identify approaches to fulfilling such a need and
              (3) begin working towards fulfilling such a need in a manner that minimizes
              animosity and compteition, engages as diverse a cross-section of the
              environmental engineering community as possible and best serves the needs of
              society.  The workshop will be held at the University of Toronto in August 2002
              in conjunction with the joint conference on Education and Research in
              Environmental Engineering and Science sponsored by the Association of
              Environmental Engineering and Science Professors and the American Academy of
              Environmental Engineers.
