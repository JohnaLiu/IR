Gas-driven volcanic eruptions are a major natural hazard.
              These eruptions are powered by the exsolution of H2O and other volatiles from
              magma. The process is complex, and understanding it requires quantification and
              modeling of a number of variables and processes, especially the diffusion of
              water. After many years of work, most of the fundamental data for high-silica
              rhyolite--a magma with 77 wt% silica--has been experimentally determined.
              However, there is a critical need for experimental studies of dacitic magmas,
              containing around 65 wt% silica and common to explosive eruptions such as the
              1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, and the
              1991 eruption of Mount Unzen. 

Under this grant, water diffusion in dacitic
              melt and glass will be investigated using dehydration and diffusion couple
              experiments over a wide range of temperature, pressure, and H2O contents.
              Experiments will be performed in one-atmosphere furnaces, rapid-quench
              cold-seal pressure vessels, internally-heated pressure vessels, and a
              piston-cylinder apparatus. Hydrous species concentrations will be analyzed by
              Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, and diffusion profiles modeled using a
              nonlinear diffusion equation. The results will be used to model bubble growth
              and magma fragmentation in dacite.
