	The 2003 Seminar on Stochastic Processes will be held at the
              University of Washington from March 27 to 29, 2003. The seminars have become
              one of the most important regular seminar series for probabilists. They attract
              and bring together an active group of eminent researchers and young specialists
              in probability and stochastic processes. This award will provide travel support
              for participants. The funds will be used primarily for women and junior
              researchers.
