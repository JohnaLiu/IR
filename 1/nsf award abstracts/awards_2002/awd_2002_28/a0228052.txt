Abstract    :
              This award supports a project to collect and develop high-resolution ice core
              records from the Dry Valleys region of Antarctica, and provide interpretations
              of interannual to decadal-scale climate variability during the last 2000 years
              (late Holocene).  The project will test hypotheses related to ocean/atmosphere
              teleconnections (e.g., El Nino Southern Oscillation, Antarctic Oscillation)
              that may be responsible for major late Holocene climate events such as the
              Little Ice Age in the Southern Hemisphere.  Conceptual and quantitative models
              of these processes in the Dry Valleys during the late Holocene are critical for
              understanding recent climate changes, and represent the main scientific merit
              of the project.  We plan to collect intermediate-length ice cores (100-200m) at
              four sites along transects in Taylor Valley and Wright Valley, and analyze each
              core at high resolution for stable isotopes (d18O, dD), major ions (Na+, Mg2+,
              Ca2+, K+, NH4+, Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, MSA), and trace elements (Al, Fe, S, Sr, B). 
              A suite of statistical techniques will be applied to the multivariate
              glaciochemical dataset to identify chemical associations and to calibrate the
              time-series records with available instrumental data.  Broader impacts of the
              project include: 1) contributions to several ongoing interdisciplinary
              Antarctic research programs; 2) graduate and undergraduate student involvement
              in field, laboratory, and data interpretation activities; 3) use of project
              data and ideas in several UMaine courses and outreach activities; and 4) data
              dissemination through peer-reviewed publications, UMaine and other paleoclimate
              data archive websites, and presentations at national and international
              meetings.
