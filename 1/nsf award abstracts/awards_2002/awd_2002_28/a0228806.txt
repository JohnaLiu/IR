Abstract    :
              This project supports the development of a multimedia authoring environment to
              be used by students to develop and test user interfaces.  Support is provided
              for the open source developers to meet to share their ideas and work and to
              plan future work.  The outcome will be a high quality, public domain
              environment for multimedia authoring and testing.
