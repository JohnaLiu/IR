Abstract    :
              This workshop focuses on new challenges of signal processing and communications
              in decentralized (non-cellular) wireless networks.  Of particluar interests are
              fundamental limitations of wireless networks, emerging signal processing and
              communications theory and techniques, sensor networks and applications, and
              recent initiatives by commercial and defense industry.  The objective is to
              identify pressing problems in communications and signal processing in the
              network environment and make recommendations about important research  areas. 
              The workshop will feature keynote speakers from leading researchers followed by
              the panel discussions.
