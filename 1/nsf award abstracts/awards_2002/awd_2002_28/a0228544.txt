Abstract    :
              This project is concerned with the study of vision as a sensor for engineering
              systems operating in complex, dynamic and unknown environments. It entails the
              analysis of measurable properties of images that depend upon controllable
              parameters such as the geometry and optics of the imaging device. These
              properties are called "controllable cues" and they include, for instance,
              stereo, motion and accommodation. In the project, the purposeful aspect of
              vision is emphasized: knowledge and representation of the environment are only
              functional to the accomplishment of control tasks, as for instance visual-based
              navigation, docking, manipulation, endoscopic surgery, Human-Machine
              Interaction. In order to address the issue of modeling and representation, it
              is necessary to understand how the geometry and the dynamics of the environment
              are related to the information coming from the imaging sensor. In the long
              term, these issues will become crucial in the study of complex systems, where
              low-level information needs to be organized in order to perform effective
              communication between different levels of a control hierarchy, or between
              different agents involved in the control structure. The research material will
              be integrated into an educational plan that spans graduate, undegraduate and
              pre-college levels. In addition, to emphasize physical intuition, the PI plan
              to develop an experimental setup on the use of controllable cues, which will be
              accessible by precollege students through an Internet educational service.
