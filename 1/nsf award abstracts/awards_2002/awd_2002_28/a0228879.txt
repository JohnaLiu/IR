Abstract    :
              Smith College, the nation's largest liberal arts college for women, hosts a
              faculty and student body with strengths in the natural and physical sciences,
              mathematics and, more recently, engineering. The College's most ambitious
              faculty research projects and conscientious efforts to prepare undergraduates
              for successful graduate study often employ research collaborations that enable
              access to data, laboratory facilities and experimental design partners at
              cutting-edge, national research facilities. Proposed Smith College research
              applications of high-speed Internet 2 access include, among others,
              multi-disciplinary, collaborative employment by a molecular biology research
              group of key, large-file genetic information and analytic resources;
              application of GIS data and high-resolution topographic imagery by Geology
              Department spatial analysts; remote manipulation of laboratory instrumentation
              including nuclear magnetic resonance machines, telescopes, and a linear
              accelerator; analysis of static and dynamic high-resolution imagery from a
              variety of sources; real-time human-machine interactivity; and teleconferenced
              collaborative research. Substantial institutional and external grant resources
              have already created top quality video conferencing, high-resolution image
              manipulation and distribution, and GIS/GPS-based spatial analysis facilities on
              campus. Combined with the independent applications described above, these
              shared resources in particular will benefit from high-speed access and, at the
              same time, enable the widest possible employment of a campus Internet 2 network
              connection by Smith faculty.
