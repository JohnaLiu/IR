Andesitic lava and ash (52-63% SiO2) erupts along
              the 35,000 km global volcanic arc system, which is associated with the
              subduction of an oceanic plate at an oceanic trench. This material contains
              water and represents one of the principal return fluxes of water from the
              earth's mantle to the crust and to the surface. Thus estimating the
              concentration of water in intermediate magma is a first order problem, as it
              not only affects the conditions of melting in the andesite source region, as
              well as the order and variety of the crystalline phases (as the magmas
              decompress on ascent), but it also is one of the fundamental controls on
              explosive volcanism. Moreover constraints on the amount of water in arc related
              magmas affects the global water budget and the question of whether more water
              is being subducted in comparison to that released by magmatism. This project
              will assess the concentration of water in Mexican andesitic magmas over a wide
              whole composition range, and will provide a thermodynamically based expression
              for the solubility of water in andesitic magma as a function of pressure,
              temperature and composition.
