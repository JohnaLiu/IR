This is a U.S.-China joint workshop proposed by Dr. James
              Elser, Arizona State University, on ecological complexity and ecosystem
              services.   The workshop will bring together American and Chinese researchers
              in biocomplexity and ecosystem services in a series of interactions designed to
              establish a network of international collaboration and exchange.  A preliminary
              meeting between U.S. and Chinese organizers will be held in November, 2002, and
              a U.S. delegation of 12 scientists will visit China in spring, 2003.

The
              intellectual merit of this proposal is outstanding.  The area of ecosystem
              services is  emerging as a topic for fundamental research.    The proposed
              collaborative activities would benefit ecological science and its contribution
              to the management of complex ecological/economic systems. The Chinese Academy
              of Sciences, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and NSF will
              jointly support the cooperative activities.
