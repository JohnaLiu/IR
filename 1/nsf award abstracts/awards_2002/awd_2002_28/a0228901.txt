Abstract    :
              This research program investigates the theory and pragmatics of naming
              and
sharing data and computation threads, using principles of
              optimal
evaluation and linear logic.  These tools explicitly highlight
              the
operations of copying and discarding that are essential in
              procedure
calling protocols.  

We will analyze the algorithmics of optimal
              evaluation, the complexity of
box management, and the evaluation pragmatics
              for languages with explicit
control.  Also included in the research agenda are
              intensional full
abstraction theorems, where the meaning of a term includes
              operational
information about how computations are shared, and the use of
              context
semantics as a flow analysis tool, where the so-called "geometry
              of
interaction" can give information about how procedures access
              their
arguments.  Finally, we want to give a refined explanation of the
              bus
system of graph reduction in terms of linear logic, in the hope of giving
              a
new categorical rendition of the incremental computation in
              optimal
evaluation.
