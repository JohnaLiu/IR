Abstract    :
              The wind-measuring instrument on the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere
              Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite, TIDI, samples about 15 longitudes
              per day at 4 distinct local times between 50 S and 50 N. This observing pattern
              allows the definition of planetary-scale waves and diurnal tides on a
              near-daily basis. The leading objectives of this project are to assimilate TIDI
              and radar winds in order to facilitate studies of short-term tidal and
              planetary wave evolution. Ground-based and satellite data will be assimilated
              using the method of sequential estimation, a technique chosen because of its
              potential to optimize wave definitions that retain short-term variations of
              dynamical significance. Tidal and planetary wave coefficients for wavenumbers
              0-5 will be disseminated to the TIMED/CEDAR community. It is expected that wide
              access to the data in an easily understood form will help to foster
              collaborative studies with the modelling community. The results of the proposed
              work are expected to maximize the potential of ground and space-based data to
              sort out the global-scale versus the local-scale causes of tidal and planetary
              scale variations that originate below and within the mesosphere and lower
              thermosphere (MLT). These goals are consistent with CEDAR Phase 3 objectives
              addressing coupling of the lower levels to the MLT.
