Abstract    :
              The investigators posit that students' mastery of complex and conceptually
              difficult mathematics in the middle and high school years can be vastly
              improved.  The tools they have chosen to advance this goal include (1) access
              to powerful hardware and software and (2) a strong professional development
              that focuses on the mathematics content, knowledge of how students learn, and
              the use of powerful technological tools.  The proposed intervention includes
              both components by building on comprehensive teacher professional development
              to support teaching with SimCalc, Geometer's Sketch Pad, and Fathom-data
              analysis.  There is evidence supporting the efficacy of SimCalc to improve
              learning outcomes; this project would test the robustness of the intervention
              for teachers whose content and technology background varies in representative
              ways.  The focal topic in this intervention is rate of change.  The
              experimental design proposed in this Phase I proposal is cast as pilot work for
              Phase II research because it uses a design that would be fitting for a Phase II
              project.
