Abstract    :
              The purpose of this workshop is to bring together leading researchers in the
              theory and
applications of Hamiltonian, Lagrangian, geometric, and hybrid
              methods for control of
nonlinear mechanical systems. The modeling and control
              issues for these systems is of vital importance in a host of applications
              ranging from control of multiple autonomous agents for surveillance,
              teleooperated surgery, planetary and undersea exploration, space-based
              construction, to the design and control of prosthetic devices and other
              biomedical applications. The workshop will address both the state of the art
              and future directions of the field.
