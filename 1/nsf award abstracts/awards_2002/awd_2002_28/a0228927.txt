Abstract    :
              This project partners the University of Texas Health Science Center at San
              Antonio (UTHSCSA) and the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), in the
              south Texas region, for connectivity to an advanced network.  Southwest
              Research Institute (SwRI) will serve as the sponsor for UTHSCSA and UTSA and
              will provide experienced technical and engineering staff to assist in
              connecting to the Abilene network through the Austin POP via a DS-3 line.   
              UTHSCSA and UTSA have a combined annual research budget of over 113 million
              dollars, enroll over 21,000 students and both are Hispanic-serving institutions
              with 56% female enrollment.   
  
The proposed high-speed network will
              enhance collaborations with scientists at 21 other Abilene-connected
              institutions and will immediately support eleven research projects via Abilene:
               
University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio 
	Global Analysis
              of Hydrodynamic and Thermodynamic Properties of Macromolecules   
              
	Development of a Remote NMR Data Acquisition Infrastructure 
	Single
              Molecule Video Microscopy 
	High-Speed Data Sharing of Brainmap Images 
              
University of Texas at San Antonio 
	GEneral NEural SImulation System
              (GENESIS) Software System  
	Analysis of the information content of cortical
              waves in the turtle visual system    
	IP-friendly Quality-of-Service
              Mechanisms 
	Adaptive Transport Protocols for High-Speed Networks  
	A Tool
              for Distance Learning  
	Learning Community Across Campuses and Institutions 
              
	Grid Computation Analysis of Uncertainty Management in the Design and       
                 
	Construction of Blast Resistance Structures for Anti-Terrorist
              Applications    

These research projects range from strictly biological
              (e.g., biochemistry at the level of single molecules) to strictly computer
              science (e.g. network transport protocols that adapt rapidly to the available
              network capacity).  Between the extremes are interdisciplinary research
              projects at the interface of biological science and mathematics (e.g., general
              neural simulation system, probabilistic reference system for the human brain,
              and numerical modeling of a turtle's visual system) plus education of future
              teachers (e.g., development of teaching strategies and the application of
              technology).
