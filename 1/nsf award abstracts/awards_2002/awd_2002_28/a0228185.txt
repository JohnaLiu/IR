Abstract    :
              Professor Michl proposes to oirganize the "Quilmes Nanoscience Workshop:
              Electronics and Molecules and Quantum Dots" at Quilmes near Tucuman, Argentina,
              on May 16-20, 2003, combining forces with his US colleague, Professor Kubiak of
              the University of California, San Diego and two Argentinian colleagues,
              Professors Ernesto Calvo (Chemistry) and Oscar Martinez (Physics) of the
              University of Buenos Aires. The subject is related to photophysics, charge
              transport, and rod-shaped molecules.
