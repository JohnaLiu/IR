Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for the "REVEL Project", an outreach and teacher
              professional development program that builds on a pilot program initiated at
              the University of Washington (UW) in 1996. The program will include twelve K-12
              teachers from a variety of states in a suite of activities related to ongoing
              research on hydrothermal vent systems of the Endeavour and Juan de Fuca plate
              systems.  The teachers will participate in cruises aboard the R/V THOMPSON or
              the R/V ATLANTIS and will have first-hand experience working on sea-going
              oceanographic research. They will work with the submersible ALVIN or an
              autonomous underwater vehicle called ABE. In addition, they will participate in
              pre and post-cruise workshops to ensure that the experiences they gain at sea
              can be translated to their students and other classrooms. The overall goal of
              the project is to encourage collaboration and partnerships between research
              groups and science educators. Significant matching funds have been provided by
              the University for shiptime each year. The program will be jointly funded by
              the Division of Ocean Sciences and Division of Elementary, Secondary and
              Informal Education.
