Abstract    :
              This proposal is a request to explore the use of electrospray mass
              spectrometry
(ES/MS/MS) to the analysis of polar ice cores. This technique is
              capable of rapid,
sensitive detection and speciation of a wide range of
              organic and inorganic analytes in
aqueous solution. The technique has the
              potential to 1) expand ice core analysis to a
wide range of ionic and polar
              organic analytes, which can potentially provide new tracers
for air mass
              origin, atmospheric reactivity, and biogeochemical activity, and 2)
              greatly
improve the speed, sensitivity, and accuracy of existing analyses of
              major and minor ions.
The ultimate goal of this effort is to identify new
              chemicals in ice cores that are sensitive
to environmental change, such as
              products of biomass burning, soil types, and marine
organics. The ES/MS/MS
              instrument will be housed in the Department of Earth System
Science. It will
              be utilized in research, in graduate education, and in undergraduate
education
              as part of the Earth and Environmental Sciences program.
