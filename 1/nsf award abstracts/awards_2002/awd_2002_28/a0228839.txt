Abstract    :
              Professor John Rabolt of the University of Delaware and Dr. Bruce Chase of
              Dupont Corporation are supported by an SGER grant from the Analytical and
              Surface Chemistry Program to develop an infrared focal plane array spectrometer
              for the real-time detection of chemical and biological agents in gases.  The
              method eliminates some of the problems of FTIR spectroscopy including
              hygroscopic optics and sensitivity to alignment due to moving parts.  The
              proposed spectrometer, already demonstrated in the 34000 to 2000 cm-1 region,
              utilizes reflection optics and dispersal and array detection so that there are
              no moving parts.  The team will extend operation to the IR fingerprint region
              so that more chemical specificity can be obtained.  

The rugged instrument
              can sample in real time and would have applications in national security,
              environmental and industrial process monitoring.
