Abstract    :
              In 1998 the President's Partnership for Advanced Technology in Housing, or PATH,
              program was initiated, with the goal to develop and disseminate new
              technologies for the housing industry. The specific goals of the PATH program
              are to reduce the monthly cost of housing by 20%, to improve the durability and
              reduce maintenance costs of housing, to reduce the environmental impact and
              energy use of housing, and to reduce the risk of loss of life, injury and
              property destruction from natural hazards.  Since 2000, more than twenty
              research projects have been funded by the National Science Foundation in
              support of the PATH program. The purpose of this project is to supplemental
              travel support for eleven of the NSF-funded PATH principal investigators to
              attend the International Conference on Advances in Building Technology, which
              will be held in December 4-6, 2000 in Hong Kong. The NSF funded investigators
              will be presenting the results of their investigations in two technical
              sessions at the conference, devoted specifically to the NSF-funded PATH
              projects. This will provide a unique opportunity to showcase the NSF-funded
              work to the international community in a single, coherent, venue. The
              supplemental support will help offset the high cost of foreign travel.
