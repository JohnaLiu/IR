This grant provides funds to help defray costs of bringing
              speakers from Europe to participate in the Workshop on Applications of
              Synchrotron Radiation in  Environmental Sciences to be held at the J. Bennett
              Johnston, Sr., Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices (CAMD) at LSU
              from June 3 to June 8, 2002.  The week-long workshop will teach students the
              basic puhsics of synchrotron radiation and how it can be utilized in
              environemntal studies.  Both theory and hands-on experimants will be conducted
              and the course material will be turned into a self-contained book for wider
              distribution following the workshop.
