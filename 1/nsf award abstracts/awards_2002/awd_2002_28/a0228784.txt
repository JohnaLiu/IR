Title: A Multi-Sensor Fused Intelligent Biomemetic Microrobot
This
              project proposes an in-depth analytical investigation, design, and development
              of an innovative and unconventional multi-sensor-fused architecture for a
              biomimetic microrobot. This device would derive its inspiration from nature and
              integrate the physical and biological characteristics of several insects. The
              microrobot would prove to be a great asset for applications in a variety of
              scientific and engineering systems that acquire, process, and integrate
              information gathered from multiple knowledge sources. Specific examples of
              capabilities to be included are the visual, auditory, proximity, olfactory, and
              communication faculties. The proposed architecture and the microrobot could be
              gainfully employed for reconnaissance and information retrieval in unstructured
              and uncertain environments. An example of such a situation is that presented by
              the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Other crucial tasks that the
              proposed microrobot could perform include that of surveillance and target
              acquisition. The operation of the microrobot would be remote; hence the
              communication protocol would be wire-free. In addition to developing a sound
              mathematical basis, the proposed microrobot architectures functioning and
              performance will be verified via exhaustive computer simulations, building a
              prototype microrobot, and validating the results by exposing the microrobot to
              a variety of unstructured environments during laboratory experiments.
