Abstract    :
              The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities is joining the existing
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Pharmaceutical
              Processing Research established at Purdue University with affiliated sites at
              the University of Connecticut and the University of Puerto Rico.  The
              University has established expertise and industrial connections in several
              areas of pharmaceutical processing.  This application stresses the fundamental
              understanding, at the molecular level, of the effects of processing on critical
              quality attributes of pharmaceutical products and in minimizing validation
              requirements through improved process monitoring.
