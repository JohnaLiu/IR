Abstract    :
              This project will utilize data taken from the Defense Meteorological Satellite
              Program (DMSP) during an entire solar cycle to expand our knowledge of the
              topside ionosphere. The topside ionosphere at low and middle latitudes is
              strongly influenced by the behavior of the low altitude F region. Changing
              solar flux can produce large variations in the F region ionization rate. In
              addition, it is well known that F region winds modulate the height and the
              density of the F peak. This can further affect the ion composition and
              temperatures in the topside ionosphere. These changes are functions of various
              parameters like latitude, longitude, season, time of day as well as solar
              activity. The objective of this project is to establish the observed
              relationships between F region dynamics and the topside composition and
              temperatures over a complete solar cycle as functions of the above-mentioned
              parameters. This work will be carried out using satellite data. The observed
              average solar cycle variations in the topside will also be compared with the F
              peak data reflected in the IRI model and in the community computational models
              like SAMI2.
