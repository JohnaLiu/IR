This proposal was submitted as a Small Grant for Exploratory
              Research (SGER) to document to continuing retreat of the Columbia Glacier, in
              southeast Alaska by rapid calving.  The Glacier is presently retreating at a
              rate of approximately .74 kilometers (km) per year.  This rapid retreat has
              been accompanied by flow speeds up to 33 meters (m) per day, making it the
              world's fastest-moving glacier.  Since 1982, the glacier terminus has retreated
              more than 13 km since the mid-eighteenth century.  It discharges ice into
              Prince William Sound in excess of 22 km3 . 

Significant changes may be
              occurring in the glacier's pattern and speed of retreat during the next year as
              the glacier terminus passes through a gap which confines its flow.  The
              activities over the next few months may provide important clues about the
              longer-term fate of Columbia Glacier as the retreat progresses up the channel
              where the glacier bed lies below sea-level.  The Principal Investigators are
              continuing their analysis of photogrammetric data from 1999, 2000, and 2001 and
              will submit a proposal to OPP/ANS in August 2002. However, the present terminus
              position and newly calculated subglacial topography may mean that that the
              glacier is at a critical state in its retreat, and that significant events may
              occur before the end of 2002.  The funds will allow them to continue the aerial
              photography through 2002 when important changes may occur as the terminus
              enters deeper water and passes a major lateral constriction.
