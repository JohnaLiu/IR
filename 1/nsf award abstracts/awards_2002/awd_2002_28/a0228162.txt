Title:  BioLINK
              Biological Language, Information and Knowledge

The BioLINK workshop will
              focus on the interconnections in biology among literature, information (in
              databases), and knowledge (in ontologies).  The challenge for BioLINK is to
              improve information access and management through a better understanding of how
              to combine and synchronize the complementary resources and techniques provided
              by these different approaches to information management.

To address these
              challenges, the workshop will bring together senior researchers to exchange
              perspective and develop a multidisciplinary perspective on information
              management in the rapidly expanding area of biology.  The specific goal will be
              to create a research roadmap that identifies the following:
	The use cases for
              biology:  how do researchers uses databases, ontologies, literature, and what
              would they like to see?
	Various ways in which these various areas
              interact
	The missing science for how to connect these resources
	A graded
              set of challenge problems that the BioLINK community can address, to make
              progress on the underlying issues of connectivity, access, and discovery.
