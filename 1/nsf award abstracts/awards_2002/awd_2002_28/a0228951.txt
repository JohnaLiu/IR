Abstract    :
              This research program investigates the theory and pragmatics of naming and
              sharing data and computation threads, using principles of optimal evaluation
              and linear logic.  These tools explicitly highlight the operations of copying
              and discarding that are essential in procedure calling protocols.

The
              project analyzes the algorithmics of optimal evaluation, the complexity of box
              management, and the evaluation pragmatics for languages with explicit control. 
              Also included in the research agenda are intensional full abstraction theorems,
              where the meaning of a term includes operational information about how
              computations are shared, and the use of context semantics as a flow analysis
              tool, where the so-called "geometry of interaction" can give information about
              how procedures access their arguments.  A further investigation of
              ``superposition'' phenomena that occur in high-level sharing is planned.  The
              final component seeks a refined explanation of the bus system of graph
              reduction in terms of linear logic, in the hope of giving a new categorical
              rendition of the incremental computation that characterizes optimal
              evaluation.
