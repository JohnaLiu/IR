Abstract    :
              Professor Kevin Lehmann of Princeton University is supported with an SGER grant
              from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to develop an optical fiber
              version of chemical ring down spectroscopy that will allow measurement of trace
              species in gases and possibly liquids.  The method takes advantage of the long
              pathlength involved in cavity ring down, as well as evanescent properties of
              the light wave in the fiber.  

If successful, this sensor could be used to
              detect chemical and biological species over distances, e.g. using fiber optic
              cables through buildings or reservoirs.  Fiberoptic bundles can be used to
              multitask the sensing.  The use of available communication equipment
              potentially makes this a viable cost-efficient system.   The applications
              include national security, environmental monitoring, and possibly in vivo
              medical monitoring.
