Abstract    :
              Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation was established by Steven
              Spielberg in1994 to collect the testimonies of a large number of Holocaust
              survivors, witnesses, liberators, and rescuers. Since then, the Shoah
              Foundation has videotaped over 51,700 testimonies in 57 countries and 32
              languages. The testimonies comprise approximately 120,000 hours of video.
              

Currently, the Shoah Foundation is supported by a National Science
              Foundation grant under the ITR program to enable Johns Hopkins University, the
              University of Maryland, and IBM to perform research experiments in voice and
              speech recognition in Holocaust testimonies.  The Shoah Foundation requests
              funding to establish a high performance network connection (155 Mb/s) between
              the Foundation digital library and researchers on Internet2. Initially, this
              network connection will facilitate the voice and speech recognition efforts by
              increasing the amount of data and the speed of access to data these researchers
              currently have. Once this connection is established, other academic research
              efforts can be enabled in the future. Currently the Shoah Foundation is a
              sponsored affiliate of Internet2 by the University of Illinois at Chicago. This
              sponsorship, and hundreds of requests from university researchers, show the
              desire of the academic community to gain access to the archive.  It will also
              help bring testimony material directly into classrooms, meeting the Shoah
              Foundation new mission to overcome prejudice, intolerance, and bigotryand the
              suffering they causethrough the educational use of the Foundation visual
              history testimonies.
