This is a continuation of an educational
              effort begun last year, culminating in a workshop for U. S. and South African
              minority undergraduates in order to provide a field laboratory experience for
              minority students within the U. S. and South Africa.  This workshop, to be held
              in December 2002 and jointly hosted by the University of Tennessee and the
              University of the Free State, consists of two parts.  The first part of the
              workshop will be a five-day undergraduate hands-on field laboratory logistics
              and research experience (20 participants).  The second part will consist of a
              day and a half of information exchange of research results of life in extreme
              environments and biotechnological applications (40 participants).
