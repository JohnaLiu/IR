This Americas award will support collaborative
              research between Dr. Judith T. Parrish-Jones of the University of Arizona and
              Dr. Oscar Alcober and Ms. Carina Colombi, Dr. Alcober's Ph.D. advisee, of
              Universidad Nacional de San Juan in Argentina for their work on the evolution
              of the Pangean megamonsoon.

The Pangean megamonsoon was a global climate
              system whose history is relevant to understanding climate dynamics.  The
              southwestern portion of Pangea, in what is now South America, has received
              little attention in the documentation of this climate system, particularly of
              the Triassic.  A well-exposed and complete Triassic stratigraphic sequence in
              western Argentina (Ischigualasto Basin) can help address the gap in our
              knowledge of the Pangean record, and is the focus of this project.  The Pis
              will conduct plant taphonomic studies in the Ischigualasto Basin.  Plant
              taphonomy is a powerful method for paleoclimate interpretation and has not been
              applied widely in South America.  Integrated with the sedimentologic studies by
              other workers and with the vertebrate taphonomy to be carried out by the
              Argentines, this study of the paleovegetation will provide an excellent record
              of the Triassic climate in this part of the world.
