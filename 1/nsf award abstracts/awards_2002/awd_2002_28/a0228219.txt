Abstract    :
              The objectives of this SGER project are to analyze the Imaging Doppler
              Interferometry (IDI) data from the Utah State University Bear Lake dynasonde to
              produce weekly mean prevailing and tidal wind profiles over the 70 - 100 km
              altitude range and to extend the Arecibo Initiative on the Dynamics of the
              Atmosphere case study approach to the Bear Lake data set to validate the
              viability of the application of IDI to the measurement of atmospheric
              turbulence parameters, a technique subject to considerable criticism within the
              aeronomy community. Particular attention will be given to the optimization of a
              gravity wave contamination algorithm to be applied to the turbulence data and
              comparison with simultaneous satellite data.
