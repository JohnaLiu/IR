Abstract    :
              The objective of the research is to help ensure an efficient, effective 
and
              equitable distribution of resources in responding to events that 
cause
              disruption in infrastructure systems and to aid in designing 
infrastructure
              systems that are robust under disruptions, due to 
natural, human-caused or
              willful acts. The approach is to develop a 
clear and unambiguous set of
              definitions of critical infrastructure 
interdependencies; a mathematical
              representation of infrastructure 
systems that incorporates interdependencies
              among and between systems; 
algorithms that can be used to run the model(s)
              for vulnerability 
assessment and emergency response; and a human-computer
              interface for 
user interaction with the model.

If successful, the benefits
              will be an improved ability to both mitigate 
the impact of and respond to
              events that have the capability to cause 
large-scale, potentially
              catastrophic damage to critical infrastructure 
systems. Critical
              infrastructure systems provide services that are 
essential to both the
              economy and well-being of nations and their 
citizens. As documented in a
              recent report to the U.S. Congress, it is 
of vital importance that these
              services not be degraded, whether by 
willful acts such as terrorism or by
              natural or random events such as 
earthquakes. The research will permit
              different act and event scenarios 
to be modeled, and their impact on the
              service provided by an 
infrastructure system assessed. The result would be
              infrastructure 
systems that are designed to be more resilient to disruptions,
              with the 
expected loss of service reduced and the required level of service
              
restored more quickly.
