The proposed work will fabricate robust, antibody-conjugated gold
              nanoparticle films as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS),
              a sensitive spectroscopic method with unmet potential for label-free chemical
              sensing.  The SERS activities of the nanoparticle-based substrates will be
              optimized as a function of interparticle spacing and periodic order.  Initial
              tests will be performed to recognize 2,4-dinitropohenol (DNP) in gas and
              aqueous environments and in the presence of several other aromatic compounds as
              a control for selectivity.  The demonstration of substrates for selective
              chemical detection of DNP can be immediately parlayed into the development of
              Raman-based sensors of chemical warfare agents, including explosives, nerve
              gases, and mustard gases and vesicants.  

The structure-activity
              relationships are based on theoretical considerations alone and have no
              experimental precedence.  However, the proposed research is hypothesis-driven
              and addresses both short-term objectives for chemical sensor development and
              fundamental issues on the plasmonic properties of nanostructured metal films,
              with subsequent potential for applications beyond chemical and biological
              sensing.
