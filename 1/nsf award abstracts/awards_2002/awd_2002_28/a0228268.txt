This award supports a study to determine the
              feasibility of developing and employing a broad variety of indicators that will
              enable monitoring of project outputs and outcomes at the program level for the
              Partnerships for Innovation Program.  The study will examine which types of
              project outputs and outcomes should be monitored; which specific indicators
              will be useful and valid for monitoring the program; and how to resolve
              whatever difficulties the awardees in the Partnerships for Innovation Program
              would face in regularly collecting and reporting the data.  The study will
              develop and validate an array of quantitative and qualitative indicators needed
              for monitoring the full range of activities supported by the Partnerships for
              Innovation Program.  The current awards will be analyzed to categorize its
              goals, progress, outcomes and impacts.  Indicators will be developed to measure
              proximate outputs at the project level.  A sample of the awards will be
              selected for interactive input to test the validity of the indicators as well
              as to obtain input of the investigators on potential methodologies to obtain
              the data.  The sample will be selected by the range of activities in the award.
               Participation by the awardees will be on a voluntary basis.
