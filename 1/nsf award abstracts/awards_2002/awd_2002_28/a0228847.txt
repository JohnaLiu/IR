              Infrastructure 2002:  NSF CISE/EIA RI and MII PI Workshop

The National
              Science Foundation has requested assistance to coordinate the Principle
              Investigator's meeting for the Research Infrastructure and Minority
              Institutions Infrastructure programs.  The PI meeting is a chance to bring
              researchers together to learn about the work of other research projects, and to
              provide a forum to discuss new ideas and future directions of the programs. 
              CRA proposes to act as the organizer of the annual RI/MII PI Workshop.  CRA is
              in a unique position to carry out the workshop support.  Their organizational
              mission is to support research and advanced education in computing, and it
              brings them in contact with many of the departments represented in the RI and
              MII programs.  This workshop will be held at the Cliff Lodge at Snowbird Ski
              and Summer Resort in Snowbird, Utah on July 12 - 14, 2002.
