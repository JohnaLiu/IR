This award supports fundamental research and education in
              condensed matter theory and the particular area of mesoscopic physics. The PI
              will carry out theoretical investigations of electronic interference phenomena
              in metal. The topics and systems for investigation include
              superconductor-ferromagnet interfaces, phase separation near the
              metal-insulator transition in silicon MOSFETs, and the superconductor-insulator
              transition. This work supports graduate level education of the next generation
              of condensed matter theorists.

This award supports fundamental
              theoretical research and education that seeks to advance our understanding of
              quantum mechanical effects involving electrons that occur on mesoscopic length
              scales in metals and superconductors. This basic research helps improve
              understanding of fundamental and novel quantum mechanical effects that occur in
              materials and contributes to the intellectual underpinnings of potential future
              electronic device technologies. This award also supports training the next
              generation of condensed matter theorists.
