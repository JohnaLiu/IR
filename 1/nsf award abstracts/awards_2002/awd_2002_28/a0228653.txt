Abstract    :
              The conference on Intelligent Systems in Molecular Biology (ISMB) provides a
              general forum for disseminating the latest developments in bioinformatics.  It
              is a multidisciplinary conference that brings together scientists from computer
              science, molecular biology, mathematics and statistics. The meeting venue
              alternates between North American and non North American sites.  ISMB 2002 will
              be held in Edmonton, Canada.  The goal is to bring together diverse scientists
              in a focus on actual biological problems, not simply theoretical calculations. 
              This makes ISMB a unique important meeting.
