Abstract    :
              The investigators will study plasma patches and blobs in the night-side
              ionosphere using multiple instruments and modeling.  These large-scale
              enhancements in ionospheric electron density have deleterious effects on
              navigation, communication, and surveillance systems at high latitudes.  The
              primary observational technique to be applied in the study is ionospheric
              tomography using a network of five beacon satellite receivers along the west
              coast of Greenland.  This is a collaborative effort involving the University of
              Texas (UT) at Austin and Southwest Research Institute (SwRI).  SwRI
              investigators will provide model simulations of the polar cap ionosphere during
              patch event time intervals.  UT Austin investigators will analyze the data from
              the beacon satellite receivers.  The study will emphasize complete and detailed
              analyses of selected patch events to identify the origin and evolution of these
              structures in the high latitude ionosphere.  The primary motivation for
              studying patches and blobs is to be able to specify and predict the large
              amplitude and phase scintillation effects on operational systems.
