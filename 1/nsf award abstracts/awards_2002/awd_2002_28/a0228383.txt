Abstract    :
              This project will examine the meso-scale magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling
              processes which create traveling convection vortices (TCVs).  TCVs were
              originally thought to be the ionospheric signature of flux transfer events at
              the magnetopause, but this has now been largely discounted.  The project will
              search for TCV events where conjugate satellite data can be used in conjunction
              with the ground-based ionospheric observations.  Data from several satellites
              will be used including the FAST, DMSP, Oersted and CHAMPS satellites.  Data
              from the GEOTAIL satellite will also be for statistical information. 
              Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling will be done to determine the dynamical
              state of the M-I system when TCVs are observed.
