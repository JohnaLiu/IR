Abstract    :
              This project will manage the research planning coordination, development
              activities and science management for the Russian-American Initiative for
              Land-Shelf Environments (RAISE) and a related new initiative on Land-Shelf
              Interactions (LSI) of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) Program over the next
              three years. These activities will provide overall coordination of RAISE-LSI
              research to maximize its scientific impact and productivity. To achieve its
              goals, the science project office will support: (1) development of a science
              plan and operational management system, (2) workshops and Working Group
              meetings to coordinate specific projects and integration of data sets to
              address research priorities, (3) communicate and coordinate with existing and
              developing international research programs, and (4) outreach efforts to
              disseminate information on current activities and the results of research
              efforts through web-site based discussion forums, presentations and planning
              reports.
