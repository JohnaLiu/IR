Abstract    :
              This Phase 1 study consists of two components: the Curriculum Research and
              Development Group (CRDG) at University of Hawaii at Manoa will prepare a one
              week introductory teacher institute and an expanded and improved version of
              long-term support. In the second component the CRDB will develop and validate
              instruments needed for a Phase 2 study. The Phase 2 study will compare the new
              professional development program, using a randomized clinical trial approach,
              to the existing Foundational Approaches in Science Teaching program to test for
              both teacher improvement and student achievement scores.
