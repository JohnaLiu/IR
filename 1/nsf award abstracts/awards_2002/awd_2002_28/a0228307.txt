In contrast to many widely used
              geochronometers, the uncertainty in the experimentally determined half-life of
              187 Re (4.23 plus or minus 0.13 x 10E10 yr; Lindner et al., 1986, 1989) is
              large (~3%). This uncertainty currently limits the application of the Re-Os
              system as a precise chronometer. This proposal requests support for an
              experimental determination of the 187 Re half-life using 1 kg of Re originally
              used by Lindner et al. (1986, 1989) in their experimental determination of the
              187 Re half-life. The aliquots will be sealed in glass stills equipped with
              break seals to prevent loss of volatile Os during storage. Storage periods of
              0.5-2.5 years are sufficient to generate 187 Os/ 188 Os >1 in all except the
              first experiment, ensuring that the precision on the 187 Os/ 188 Os is not
              limited by the abundance of radiogenic 187 Os. Five independent determinations
              of the 187 Re half-life will be made using plasma ionization multicollector
              mass spectrometry on initially Os-free perrhenic acid. The expected overall
              uncertainty of the 187 Re half-life using this approach is <0.4%.
