Abstract    :
              This award provides renewed funding for a program called the Minorities in
              Marine Science Undergraduate Program (MIMSUP) for academic years 2004-2009.
              MIMSUP, operated at Western Washington University's Shannon Point Marine Center
              (SPMC) since 1990, will provide marine education to eight under-represented
              minority students annually recruited from around the nation. Students will
              spend two quarters in residence taking a total of 31 credits that may be
              transferred back to their home institutions. During the first quarter, students
              take a laboratory/field course in oceanography, a current trends course that
              introduces them to modern investigative techniques and the potential
              professional opportunities that will be available to them, a research course in
              which they plan and execute an independent project under the supervision of a
              faculty member. They all participate in a program that involves training in and
              application of outreach education in marine science to K-12 school children.
              During the second quarter, students will take a scientific research and two
              additional courses covering various marine science topics. Students receive
              full tuition, housing, travel costs, and a stipend, as well as support to
              participate in regional and national meetings. The stipend supports the
              students' participation in K-12 outreach activities of about 10 hours per week
              in local schools. Western Washington University provides significant
              institutional support for this program in faculty salary, laboratory supplies,
              and access to boat-time for the students.
