Abstract    :
              The proposed focuses on teachers and students in Head Start and State funded
              pre-K programs that serve predominately low income and minority populations. 
              The assumption is that this is a key age group in that lagging proficiency in
              school subjects, mathematics included, often has roots in the preschool years. 
              The intervention is a pre-K mathematics curriculum that is based on knowledge
              of human development and that employs technologies fitting for multiple levels.
               A randomized experimental design will be used to investigate the efficacy of
              the curriculum for students served by Head Start and state-funded pre-K
              programs.  The proposed study will increase knowledge of scaling up pre-K
              intervention across programmatic contexts for diverse low-income students in
              their growing knowledge of mathematical ideas.  They research design will
              permit inferences about what contextual variables contributed to outcomes.
