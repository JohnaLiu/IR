The objective of this project is to develop a new breed of
              self-contained microelectrodes that can be used in the environment to monitor a
              variety of constituents in contaminated soils and sediments.  These devices
              will consist of a microelectrode intimately connected to a microelectronic
              signal processor to reduce noise and increase robustness.  These devices will
              ultimately include a transmitter to telemeter the information to a conventional
              data storage device and will be powered by a miniature battery.  The goals of
              the proposed research are threefold: (1) develop the fundamental science to
              microfabricate the integrtated microelectrodes, (2) design, and fabricate, a
              microprocessor to process and amplify signals from the microelectrodes and (3)
              demonstrate integrated microelectrode arrays for environmental monitoring using
              proof-of-concept sensors.  If successful, this project will have benefit at the
              thousands of hazardous waste sites in the US that require monitoring of the
              soils, sediments and ground waters for a variety of constituents, including
              toxic or hazardous materials and environmental parameters.
