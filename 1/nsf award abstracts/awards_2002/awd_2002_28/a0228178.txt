Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Alice Harris will coordinate a
              meeting to plan a variety of activities associated with the eventual
              development of a new initiative within NSF. The long-range goal of these
              activities is to dedicate funding to projects that document endangered
              languages. Such documentation is significant for (1) the relation between
              language variation and hypothesized limitations in cognitive capacity; (2) the
              ways that constituence and history of language families inform research on
              human pre-history; (3) how knowledge of the natural world is encoded in dying
              languages.
