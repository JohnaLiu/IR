Travel support is provided for a group of US tribologist to
              attend the Asian tribology conference, which is held every four years and which
              is named ASIATRIB.  The group will include several graduate students and
              postdocs.  The purpose of the trip is to discover the status of the field in
              the Asian countries, in particular in the rapidly growing industrial economies
              of Korea, China and Taiwan, and to explore possible areas of future
              collaborative research.
