We propose to organize
              a workshop: Mimetic Methods for Discretizing Continuum Problems.
There are
              several di.erent research groups and individual researchers that have
              rather
recently realized that they working on discretization methods that have
              many common features
that we refer here to as mimetic. This workshop will be
              the .rst organized to bring
this group of people together for the first
              time.
There are many powerful methods for discretizing problem in continuum
              mechanics:
finite element, di.erence and volume methods;sp ectral
              methods;along with various generalizations
and combinations of these.
              Typically, these methods start with a continuummechanics
problem described in
              terms of partial-differential, ordinary-differential, integral,
and algebraic
              equation and then discretize this description of the problem. Some methods
may
              instead start with an integral description  in terms of conservation laws  or
              start with
the problem described in terms of differential forms.
