The American
              Astronomical Society (AAS) will administer a three-year international travel
              grant program that will support the participation of U.S. astronomers at
              international scientific meetings. Astronomy is a fully international endeavor,
              and the attendance of U.S. astronomers at scientific meetings worldwide is
              critical to their continued activity in the field.  The AAS Council will
              appoint a committee to review applications and the program will be administered
              by the AAS Executive Officer.  During 2003, the year of the 25th General
              Assembly of the International Astronomical Union, the program will accommodate
              a larger number of grants, considered separately from normal scientific
              meetings, to enable a strong U.S. presence at this important function.  The
              program will benefit American astronomical research by fostering international
              collaboration and interaction by enabling U.S. astronomers, especially early
              career astronomers and those from smaller or less-endowed institutions, to
              attend international scientific meetings.
