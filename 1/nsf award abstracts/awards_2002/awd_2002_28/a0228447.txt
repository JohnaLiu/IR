Abstract    :
              
The project builds on a planning effort to examine the effects of highly rated
              science curricula on diverse populations of students in a large school
              district. The proposal now plans to study the effects of 3 highly rated
              curriculum units on student outcomes (achievement, motivation, and engagement)
              in the same large, diverse school system. Data will be disaggregated to find
              out if the curricula produce different effects on various subpopulations of
              eighth grade students.  In addition to achievement data, a study will be
              conducted of video analyses of student interactions.  Finally, a scaling study
              will examine factors likely to have an impact on the curriculum units'
              effectiveness, including fidelity of implementation.
