Abstract    :
              The proposed research builds on previous research examining public policy and
              cultural values of stakeholders in land use policy for arctic wilderness areas.
               The proposed research expands on the previous research by investigating ways
              of reducing land use conflict in arctic wilderness areas.  Through both
              quantitative and qualitative research methods, Dr. Gladden will do a comparison
              of three case studies of wilderness areas in Finnish Lapland, Alaska, and the
              Yukon Territories of Canada.  Four research hypotheses will be examined to
              explain the variation in conflict between local and non-local groups in the
              three case study areas: 1) increased policy control by local residents reduces
              conflict, 2) increased participation in planning processes reduces conflict, 3)
              legal integration of national laws leads to decreased conflict, 4) reduced
              focus on ideological values in the planning process, decreases conflict.
