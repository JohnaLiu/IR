Abstract    :
              Uranium-series isotopes have provided unique insight into geochemical rates and
              processes during genesis of basaltic magma from the earth's mantle.
              Specifically, recent measurements of the longer-lived isotopes of the U-decay
              series have placed important constraints on melting rates (related to solid
              mantle upwelling rates) and melt fractions. However, there have been relatively
              few measurements of the shorter-lived isotopes of the U decay series in
              basaltic samples. As a result, time-dependant parameters such as melt transport
              rates and magma storage times are not well known. To better constrain these
              parameters, under this SGER award, the PIs propose to measure short-lived 227Ac
              (t1/2 =21.8 y) in young basaltic samples from mid-ocean spreading centers and
              intraplate volcanoes like Hawaii. This geochronologic system has the potential
              to be an important chronometer for dating of young mid-ocean ridge basalts in
              the time range of 10-100 years. Development of a new counting technique for
              227Ac has simplified its analysis making this research possible for the first
              time.
