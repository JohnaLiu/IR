Abstract    :
              
This workshop (February 7-9, 2003) focuses on an area of increasing interest
              to scholars in economics and decision science - the attempt to connect research
              on cognitive neuroscience with research on decision making.  This area, which
              has been called "neuro-economics" is very much in its infancy.  The catalyst
              for the huge amount of interest in the area in the last few years was the
              publication of "Descartes' Error," a book by neuroscientist Antonio Damasio
              demonstrating that damage to parts of the brain involved in processing
              emotional information can impair decision making.  This finding has been of
              interest to researchers for two main reasons - first, it suggests that the
              widespread belief that emotion interferes with effective decision making is
              wrong.  Second, it suggests that insights into decision making and economic
              behavior can be obtained by relating such behavior to neurological
              phenomena.

The proposed workshop is the third in a series at the University
              of Arizona that bring together scholars working on topics in decision science,
              emotion and neuroscience.  The particants include 3 of the 12 researchers who
              participated in the "Behavioral Economics" symposium at the Nobel award
              ceremony this year (Kahneman, Slovic, Smith).
