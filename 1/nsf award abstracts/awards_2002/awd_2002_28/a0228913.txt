Abstract    :
              This project will enable The University of Toledo to provide 45 Mbps connections
              to support faculty research, research collaboration, and collaboration for
              specific educational projects. The project provides needed bandwidth for seven
              applications needing to transfer large data sets, images, and video files.  The
              projects are: 
 
o X-ray Crystallography that provides UT chemists with
              access to national synchrotron laboratories and to other Ohio researchers
              involved in the Ohio Crystallography Consortium; 
o Geographic Information
              Systems and Remote Sensing that provides access to OhioView and to other remote
              data centers; 
o Internet-based Laboratories that provides high bandwidth,
              high fidelity connection to transfer data, control signals, audio, and video in
              real-time for Internet-based laboratory experiments; 
o Astrophysical Data and
              Observations to access archived data and for remote observing and control; 
o
              Computational Studies of G Protein-Coupled Receptors in a Lipid Bilayer to
              access the Ohio Supercomputer Center and other supercomputers; 
o
              Speech-language Pathology to provide therapeutic services to distant or
              mobility impaired clients with language disorders; and 
o Large Scale ATM and
              MLS Network Simulation to collaborate with the Ohio 
Supercomputer Center on
              research issues related to simulation of large scale Multi-Protocol Label
              Switching networks.
