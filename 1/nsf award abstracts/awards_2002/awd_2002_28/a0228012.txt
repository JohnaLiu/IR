The proposal requests travel expenses for US researchers
              to participate in a US-EU/DELOS working group on "Personalisation and
              Recommender Systems in Digital Libraries."  The working group will meet over
              the next year to discuss and evaluate fruitful joint activities and research
              paths for collaborative activities in this general topical area.
This working
              group continues the planning and research agenda initiated by an earlier
              workshop , the Joint DELOS-NSF Workshop on Personalisation and Recommender
              Systems in Digital Libraries held at Dublin City University, Ireland, June
              18-20, 2001. http://la.lti.cs.cmu.edu/callan/Workshops/delos01/cfp2.html. 
              Prior research on personalisation and recommender systems was primarily in the
              context of commercial environments with a limited set of goals.  This planning
              activity is meant to help develop a broader research agenda in environments
              such as academic and research libraries with the goal of broadening the overall
              beneficial impact of these technologies.
