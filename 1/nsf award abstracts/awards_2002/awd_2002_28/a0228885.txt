Abstract    :
              The overall goal is to establish a high performance connection to the Abilene
              advanced Internet facility to support science research.  To achieve this
              connection Brandeis will establish the advanced connection via Northern
              CrossRoads (NoX) to the Abilene network.  Brandeis will link to the NoX gigapop
              directly through a leased fiber connection provided by RCN, which will also
              provide the end switches and the circuit monitoring equipment as well as manage
              the circuit. 

The proposers have identified four areas of research that
              require the use of a high performance network connection.   The investigators
              in each of these areas of research have coped with inadequate bandwidth for a
              number of years.  They have been remarkably adaptive in working out ways to
              deal with this situation, but the time has come to sustain their research with
              a high performance Internet connection.
