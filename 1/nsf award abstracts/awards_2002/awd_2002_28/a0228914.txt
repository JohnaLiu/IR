Abstract    :
              The investigators will use existing coordinated measurements from low-, mid- and
              high-latitude instrument cluster sites to investigate the impact of
              short-period gravity waves on the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT)
              region.  In particular, the study concentrates on the sources and seasonal
              variability of these waves.  Instruments to be used include airglow imagers,
              wind and temperature lidars, and radars.  The investigators will use coincident
              observations of gravity waves and height-resolved measurements of the wind and
              temperature field throughout the MLT region.  By together data available from
              several key sites with state-of-the-art modeling capabilities, they will study
              the regional effects of wind filtering on the wave flux transfer into the MLT
              and identify their dominant sources under differing source conditions.  The
              study is essential to understand the observed seasonal variability and to help
              quantify the regional impact of small-scale gravity waves on the MLT region. 
              These results will have application to studies of global change and space
              weather effects on technical systems.
