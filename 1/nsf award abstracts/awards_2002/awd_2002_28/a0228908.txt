Abstract    :
              Compilation of a new lithotectonic map of the Appalachian Orogen, sponsored
              largely through NSF-EAR, is nearly complete. The new map incorporates more than
              20 years of new data and ideas that were generated mainly in response to the
              publication of the original Tectonic Lithofacies map of the orogen in 1978. The
              original map has had a lasting impact on the tectonics community, both from the
              standpoints of regional conceptualization and application. The new map has
              similar, if not greater, promise; not only will the new map give a significant
              facelift to the dated original, it will also incorporate modern technological
              advances in geographic information systems (GIS). Thus, the new map adds an
              entirely new dimension to the Appalachians and will surpass the capabilities of
              the original map by allowing for i. construction of new theme maps, ii.
              Addition of new databases, and iii. ease in updating the lithotectonic base. A
              substantial portion of the production costs of the map is being shouldered by a
              collaborative effort between the US Geological Survey and the Geological Survey
              of Canada; however, they cannot support the entire financial burden of map
              production. Herein, we request funds mainly for printing of the hard copies of
              the new map.
