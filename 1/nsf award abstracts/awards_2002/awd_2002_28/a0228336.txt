This SGER award will allow the PIs to film the commencement,
              this summer, of drilling activities for the San Andreas Fault Drilling Project,
              near Parkfield , California.  The 2 km deep hole adjacent to the San Andreas
              Fault (SAF), is a pilot hole for an eventual 4.5 km hole to be drilled through
              the SAF as part of the EarthScope initiative now being considered as part of
              NSF's FY 2003 budget.  This deep hole project (SAFOD - San Andreas Fault
              Observatory at Depth) would be the first underground earthquake observatory to
              penetrate a seismically active fault zone at such an extreme depth.

Earth
              Images Foundation will film the commencement of the SAFOD pilot hole project to
              generate crucial footage for an educational television documentary about the
              value of scientific drilling. The visual appeal, scientific importance, and
              societal urgency of the SAFOD project makes it an ideal candidate for inclusion
              in a major educational television documentary.  Television programs about
              earthquakes draw large audiences on PBS and Discovery Channel, and a
              documentary that highlights the SAFOD project will show how scientists are
              using the unusual technique of deep drilling to study this phenomenon.  It
              promises viewers an insider's look at the improvement of theories about how
              earthquakes work and insight on earthquake hazards, a factor that has been
              shown to contribute to an increase in public safety in earthquake-prone
              regions.

After the initial filming of the pilot hole commencement, the film
              footage will be processed and transferred to digital video format, then stored
              for later use in a planned television documentary about scientific
              drilling.
