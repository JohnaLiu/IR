Abstract    :
              This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) - Faculty and
              Students in Industry component - award provides support of an Oakland
              University Systems Engineering Student for a one semester visit with the
              Advanced Manufacturing Technology Group at the DaimlerChrysler Technology
              Center. The research project is to study the development of a supervisory
              system which monitors the physical manufacturing systems and compares its
              behavior with that of an equivalent computer simulation model.  It is proposed
              that if the behavior of the physical manufacturing system varies from that of
              the computer simulation model due to the modifications made to the physical
              system, the supervisory system will identify these changes and attempt to
              modify the model to account for them.

The results of the study will be
              communicated through a series of company briefings, as well as publications in
              appropriate academic journals.
