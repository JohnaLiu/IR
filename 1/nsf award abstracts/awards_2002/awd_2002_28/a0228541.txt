Abstract    :
              This Special Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award provides funds to
              support the construction, testing, and development for scientific use of an
              ultra-slow, ultra-cold "superleak" superfluid helium beam.  The superleak
              helium beam offers seemingly unprecedented directionality and intensity in
              addition to the novel coherence properties intrinsic to the superfluid itself. 
              Although the superleak source is still very much in a developmental stage, it
              seems increasingly likely to offer extraordinary and completely novel ways of
              investigating superfluid helium and of characterizing and synthesizing
              materials, particularly on nanoscale dimensions.
