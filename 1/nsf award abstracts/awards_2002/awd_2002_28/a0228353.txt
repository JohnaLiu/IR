Abstract    :
              
The goal of the proposed project is to extend the science and reading
              comprehension intervention known as Science IDEAS to larger scales.  The
              intervention combines science inquiry with reading comprehension and writing
              activities in two-hour daily time blocks in grades 3 through 8.  The proposed
              project would expand the program to almost 40,000 students and would study the
              implementation and its effects.  To help to insure its effectiveness, the
              project also provides the necessary infrastructure of leadership training,
              mentorship, and coaching. The proposal thereby addresses capacity issues in
              schools as mitigating the success of interventions and perpetuating
              deficiencies in students' science and reading achievement.  A twofold research
              design is proposed, involving a school-level randomized experiment and a
              multiple baseline study of intervention efficacy in terms of maintaining
              previously attained student performance outcomes of the intervention during its
              scale up.  Investigators anticipate advancing the process of educational reform
              through this research by validating and disseminating a multi-phase design for
              scale up.
