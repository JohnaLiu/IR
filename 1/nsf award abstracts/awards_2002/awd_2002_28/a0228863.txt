Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR)
              for a long-standing program of travel assistance to qualified and active
              oceanographic researchers from developing countries and nations with economies
              in transition. SCOR travel grants are awarded to enable such individuals to
              attend international meetings relevant to their scientific interests and to
              those of SCOR and the Division of Ocean Sciences of NSF.  This ongoing project
              has become the cornerstone of SCOR's efforts to provide assistance to marine
              scientists in the third world and, more recently in Russia and Eastern Europe. 
              All recipients of funds are informed that this assistance is made possible
              through a grant to SCOR from the US National Science Foundation. Project
              objectives include: broading the participation of scientists from developing
              countries, eastern Europe, and Russia in international marine science events;
              encouraging contacts between scientists from the United States and other
              developed countries with their colleagues in developing countries, and to
              facilitate the transfer of knowledge in all disciplines of oceanography; making
              available specialized regional knowledge and expertise at meetings where this
              is needed, for example, in the planning of regional components of large-scale
              experiments; and providing opportunities for involvement of developing country
              scientists in international collaborative programs.
