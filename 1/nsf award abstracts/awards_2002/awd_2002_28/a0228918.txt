Abstract    :
              Bethune-Cookman College (B-CC), a historically black college, is an
              internationally respected undergraduate liberal arts and sciences college.
              Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) is the world's oldest, largest, and
              most prestigious university specializing in aviation and aerospace and granting
              undergraduate and graduate degrees. This project is a unique collaboration
              between these two diverse institutions to facilitate meritorious research by
              connecting to Internet 2 in a cost effective manner. Bethune Cookman College
              (B-CC) and Embry Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) will share costs for a
              DS-3 (45Mbps) data circuit to Internet2. B-CC will be the aggregation point and
              will then connect thru University of Central Florida to the University of South
              Florida gigaPOP where the Internet2 peering will occur.   The purpose of the
              connection is to assist and expand current research in biology (B-CC),
              meteorology and air traffic management (ERAU). The project also provides
              state-of-the-art research accessibility to a traditionally underrepresented
              population, i.e. scientists, students, and educators at historically black
              colleges (B-CC).
