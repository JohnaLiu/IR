Abstract    :
              With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the Office
              of Multidisciplinary Activities are supporting the research and educational
              efforts of  Dr. Jeffrey Willemsen of the Department of Chemistry at Willamette
              University and Dr. Ronald G. Brisbois of the Department of Chemistry at
              Macalaster College.  The collaborative research of the two principal
              investigators will be merged into their collaborative efforts regarding the
              Willamette University Native American Summer Science Camp.  The science camp
              participants, grade 8-10 students, will be introduced to the synthesis of
              organic compounds by taking part in an ongoing project to prepare and study the
              properties of CpCoCb-bridged cyclophanes.  Fundamental aspects of laboratory
              technique and structural characterization will be stressed in this pilot
              program.
