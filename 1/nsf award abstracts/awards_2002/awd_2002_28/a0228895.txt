Abstract    :
              The bioavailability of Fe has been shown to regulate primary production in high
              nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) marine environments. More than 99% of dissolved
              iron in HNLC systems is organically-complexed, and these Fe-ligand complexes
              represent (at least indirectly) the pool of Fe that is bioavailable to marine
              plankton. However, the character and source of the Fe-binding ligands in
              seawater are unknown. Recent research has suggested that the activity of
              naturally occurring viral populations provides sufficient organically
              complexed-Fe to regenerate the concentrations of dissolved Fe measured in a
              HNLC coastal upwelling system in a time frame consistent with the growth of the
              phytoplankton community. The goal of this SGER proposal is to participate in
              the upcoming (January  February 2003) FeCycle analysis and (in collaboration
              with scientists from the University of Otago (NZ) and the University of
              Delaware) to determine the rate at which viruses recycle Fe back to the marine
              microbial community. A 12-day experiment in the vicinity of 46 degrees 30
              degrees S, 178 degrees 30 degrees E will build on 4 years of research in this
              region. The overall objective of the project is to collect information that
              will allow for the development of a preliminary model for the cycling of Fe in
              this system in the absence of Fe fertilization.
