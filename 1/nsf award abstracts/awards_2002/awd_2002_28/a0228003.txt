Abstract    :
              This project addresses the chemical composition of emissions from biomass
              burning. Biomass burning is a major source of trace gases and particles. In
              particular, the following questions will be addressed: 1. What are the major
              reactive and stable initial emissions from tropical deforestation fires,
              biofuel use, and agricultural waste burning? 2. Smoke plumes are both an
              unusual environment and a globally significant source of reactive gases. What
              is the rate of the photochemistry in smoke plumes from tropical deforestation
              fires? 3. What are the effects of cloud processing on gases and particles in
              Brazilian smoke?

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic techniques
              will be used to measure nearly all the major reactive and stable trace gases in
              biomass burning smoke. Airborne FTIR will be installed on a Brazilian research
              aircraft along with instruments that measure particle emission factors, size
              distribution, absorption, and scattering, as well as gas phase composition,
              including volatile organic compounds, and hydroxyl radicals. Comprehensive
              airborne measurements of the emission factors for savanna fires, tropical
              deforestation fires, and pasture maintenance fires will be made in Brazil for
              several weeks during the 2003/4 burning season.
