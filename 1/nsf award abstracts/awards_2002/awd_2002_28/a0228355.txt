Abstract    :
              This award supports a postdoctoral researcher to study the coupling between
              tropospheric disturbances, such as hurricanes and tropical depressions, and the
              lower thermosphere/ionosphere region.  The objective of the research is
              three-fold:  1) Observe possible effects of hurricanes and tropical depressions
              on the F-region ionosphere, 2) Ascertain whether the tropical storms produce
              observable gravity wave propagation into the thermosphere, and 3) Determine if
              gravity waves or electric fields are more likely to produce F-region
              disturbances.  The approach is to assemble a database of F-region measurements
              coincident with storm occurrence.  The study will use ionosonde and incoherent
              scatter radar measurements made at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. 
              After assembling the database, the data will be analyzed for F-region
              disturbances, the relative position and strength of any associated tropical
              storm, and variations in F-region density and electric fields.  Understanding
              the coupling between the ionosphere and other atmospheric regions contributes
              to knowledge of space weather and its impacts on technical systems.
