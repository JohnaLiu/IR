Abstract    :
              This award is to support a postdoctoral researcher to study polar mesospheric
              clouds (PMC).  The study will make use of a combination of satellite
              observations and numerical models to study the global variation of PMC
              brightness and occurrence frequency, and determine the dependence on transient
              mesospheric dynamics.  The satellite observations are from the Student Nitric
              Oxide Explorer (SNOE) and the Thermosphere, Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics
              and Dynamics (TIMED) spacecraft.  The combined data sets will be used to
              establish the connection between dynamical features seen in the SNOE
              observations and their counterpart in temperature and water vapor measured by
              TIMED.  The data will be combined with an atmospheric climate model and a cloud
              microphysics model to help clarify the dynamical processes that give rise to
              observed variability in temperature and water vapor in the middle atmosphere.
