Abstract    :
              The Exploratorium will conduct a two-year project to establish and maintain a
              High Performance Network Connection (HPNC) to the national Abilene/Internet2
              backbone through an affiliation with the Corporation for Education Network
              Initiatives in California (CENIC), the statewide Abilene Participant
              organization.  The HPNC will enable the Exploratorium to expand its media-based
              and museum-based educational programs to include high-bandwidth IPvideo
              transmission, MPEG2video/audio streaming, transmission of high-resolution
              imagery, real-time data mining and manipulation, remote videoconferencing, and
              other multimedia applications requiring a DS-3 (45mbps) connection.   
 
The
              project will involve using existing fiber and equipment requiring minimal
              upgrades to connect the Exploratorium's Palace of Fine Arts building to the
              California Research and Education Network (Cal-REN2) POP in Sunnyvale, Calif.,
              which serves as a port to the Abilene/Internet2 backbone. 
 
The installation
              and connectivity project has been planned in collaboration with CENIC, which is
              in the process of linking K-20 educational institutions throughout California
              to an optic network.  CENIC's sponsorship of the Exploratorium will strengthen
              the museum's ties to the educational technology community and increase access
              to the museum's extensive educational programming to schools and colleges
              throughout the Abilene/I2 network. 
 
The HPNC will provide the Exploratorium
              with access to high-bandwidth connections to partner research organizations,
              such as CERN, JPL, and NASA, who participate in Exploratorium Webcasts and
              remote educational programs. The programs produced will be made available over
              the Cal-REN2 and Abilene/Internet2 networks to participating educational
              institutions and researchers, including the schools linked to the CENIC Digital
              California Project, the Pacific Lighthouse Project, and the I2K20 Initiative.
              

The HPNC will further the impact and reach of existing, federally supported
              Exploratorium programs such as Origins, a three-year series of NSF-supported
              Webcasts from remote science research stations; the Microscope Imaging Station,
              an NIH-funded state-of-the-art microscopy station in the museum's wet biology
              lab; and Eclipses and Observatories, the Exploratorium's ongoing production of
              remote Webcasts in partnership with the NASA Sun-Earth Connection Education
              Forum.
