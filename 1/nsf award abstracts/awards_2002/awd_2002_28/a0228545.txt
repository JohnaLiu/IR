Hobson

This award supports a planning visit by Dr. Rosalyn S.
              Hobson, Department of Electrical Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University
              to South Africa in August 2002 to confer with Dr. Kimberly J. Battle, School of
              Mechanical Engineering, University of Witwatersrand (WITS), Johannesburg.  The
              purpose of the visit is to design a partnership between the two universities
              that will include exchange of students and faculty.  During the visit, the
              professors will identify possible student research projects and investigate the
              exchange program logistics.  While at WITS, Dr. Hobson will conduct a short
              course on neural networks.  This planning visit is supported jointly by the
              Office of International Science and Engineering and the Directorate for
              Engineering.
