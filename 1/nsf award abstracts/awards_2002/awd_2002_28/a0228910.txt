In the past the investigator developed techniques
              to study
Gromov hyperbolic groups. There are several applications of
              those
techniques in topology, geometry, algebra, analysis. In
              particular,
hyperbolic groups were characterized by bounded cohomology,
              extending
results my M. Gromov. This characterization was used by A. Connes
              and
H. Moscovici for a proof of the Novikov conjecture for hyperbolic
              groups.
S. Gersten provided several descriptions of hyperbolicity in terms
              of
various (co)homology theories, and later the investigator
              made
contributions in that direction. Recently, Guoliang Yu and
the
              investigator were able to prove the Baum-Connes conjecture
for hyperbolic
              groups and their subgroups. The techniques will be further
developed to
              address these and other directions. For example,
(co)homological descriptions
              of relative hyperbolicity will be studied.
As another application, the
              conformal and other geometric structures
on hyperbolic groups will be
              constructed. It is the investigator's
hope that this will lead, in particular,
              to a better understanding
of open conjectures in 3-dimensional topology.

It
              is an important and interesting task to investigate shapes
of spaces, in
              particular of the one in which we live. Geometry studies
spaces of various
              shapes. Group theory studies groups, that is,
sets of symmetries of spaces.
              Geometric group theory provides
links between spaces and groups. Every group
              has an orbit (!) in some 
space (!). The orbit is only a part of the space,
              but once something
is known about the the group, geometric group theory
              provides information
not only about the orbit, but about the whole space as
              well. Tools from
several areas of mathematics are used for that. The research
              part of this
proposal is to develop and use those tools. Another part of the
              proposal
is organizing and supporting the G^3 = "Geometric group theory on the
              gulf
coast conference" that would allow exchange of ideas among
              mathematicians
of various research interests.
