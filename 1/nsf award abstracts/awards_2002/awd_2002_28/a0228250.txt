Abstract    :
              This award supports the second EarthScope Education and Outreach (E&O) workshop
              in August 2002 to formalize responsibilities and identify outstanding needs of
              the nationally distributed E&O program.  The workshop will provide more
              concrete direction for developing the program and sustaining it over the next
              decade.  The draft E&O program plan, based on recommendations from the E&O
              workshop and continuing community discussion, will provide the starting point
              for the August workshop.

The workshop will provide an opportunity for
              community discussion and revision of the draft program plan and for determining
              the appropriate mechanisms for electing the E&O Steering Committee once
              EarthScope is funded.  The workshop must bring together both the community of
              E&O providers and the community of E&O audiences.  The participants for this
              meeting will be chosen by the E&O Steering Committee and the Workshop Planning
              Group to have adequate representation of EarthScope scientific and facility
              leadership; state and federal geologic surveys and hazard mitigation groups;
              museums; parks and other informal educators; K-16 educators; education and
              outreach specialists; and NSF and NASA representatives.
