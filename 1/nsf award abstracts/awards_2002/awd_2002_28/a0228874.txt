Abstract    :
              Amherst College is known for excellence in both research and teaching by its
              faculty, and for providing its undergraduate students with the research
              experiences normally found only at the graduate level.  Amherst prides itself
              on hiring faculty who are among the top researchers in the country, and so are
              engaged in cutting-edge research similar to the work being done at large
              research universities.  An increasing number of Amherst science faculty
              collaborate with researchers at other institutions, and need the very high
              bandwidth and quality of service of Internet2 to collaborate effectively and
              efficiently. 

The College has recognized that high bandwidth connectivity is
              fast becoming an essential tool for many faculty, and has committed to making
              improvements in the campus infrastructure.  Nevertheless, Amherst location in a
              rural area has hurt the College ability to acquire cost-effective
              telecommunications circuits to the main Internet and Internet2 access points.
              Working with the other schools in Five Colleges, Inc., Amherst College is eager
              to implement a cost-effective fiber network connecting the five institutions to
              Springfield, Massachusetts, the closest point on the main  telecommunications
              corridors. This proposed grant will be used primarily to establish such
              high-performance connectivity.
