Abstract    :
              This project aims to develop a framework and tools for defining, describing and
              supporting the publication and dissemination requirements of community digital
              libraries. It also expects to package the tools and software to create a
              general solution for implementation and deployment of resources for diverse
              communities. The promise in the approach is that publishing and dissemination
              will become more sustainable and effective by moving responsibilities to the
              author. Four test deployments will be done involving the US Geological Survey,
              the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Open Language Archives community and
              selected computer science departments already involved with NCSTRL-OAI.
              Monitoring usage will be a part of the overall effort.
