Abstract    :
              The introduction of European infectious diseases to the Americas resulted in a
              catastrophic loss of life among the indigenous populations.  While this tragedy
              was widespread throughout the Americas, it can be exemplified by the history of
              the Havasupai, a Yuman-speaking tribe of northern Arizona.  The Havasupai
              inhabit a remote side canyon of the Grand Canyon and live in relative
              isolation.  Between 1897 and 1905, the Havasupai suffered serial epidemics of
              introduced influenza and measles; only one-quarter of the population survived. 
              Previous research suggests that these epidemics resulted in selection for
              individuals who were heterozygous at two major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
              genes, which are critical components of immunological defense against
              pathogens.

To determine whether the pattern of variation at MHC genes in the
              Havasupai is the result of selection for pathogen resistance, we intend to
              perform a genome-wide survey of microsatellite loci, which are highly mutable
              markers that are not subject to natural selection.  Because these markers are
              not subject to selection, their pattern of variation will reflect only the
              demographic history of the Havasupai.  We will examine 106 loci spread over all
              22 autosomes, three of which are linked to the MHC genes and 15 pairs are
              linked to one another.  The patterns of inheritance, population variation, and
              association between linked pairs will determine conclusively if natural
              selection is responsible for the variation observed at the MHC genes of this
              representative population.  This research promises to yield insight into the
              genetic consequences of the Native American population declines associated with
              colonization of the Americas by Europeans.
