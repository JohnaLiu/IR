Abstract    :
              The proposed study will assess the state of smaller multi-user facilities within
              the materials research complex in the United States.  It will consider methods
              for optimizing the use of existing resources, including  consideration of
              structural strategies and actions to provide services more efficiently, such as
              consolidation of smaller facilities into regional centers.  The study will
              consider university and national laboratory facilities and possible some
              facilities in the commercial sector.  The study will also examine the ways
              other countries manage smaller facilities.

The assessment will include: (1)
              a definition of such facilities and their role in the scientific complex; (2)
              collection of data on, and an analysis of, the usage, structure, and
              cost-effectiveness of facilities currently in use; (3) an analysis of verious
              models for facility operations, their effectiveness, and appropriate metrics
              for success; (4) an assessment of opportunities for instrumentation research in
              the context of facilities; (5) the educational role played by smaller
              facilities; (6) the optimization of investment in smaller facilities, including
              the reallocation of existing resources; and (7) the development of long-range
              models for the support of regional centers.
