This
              award provides partial support for active research mathematicians
with limited
              means of support to attend and participate in the
Yamabe Memorial Symposium to
              be held at the University of Minnesota
in the fall semester of 2002.  The main
              speakers will include
Peter Li, Richard Hamilton, Fang-Hua Lin and Bennett
              Chow.
These talks are expected to be comprehensible introductions to
recent
              high-level research on aspects of geometry and analysis.
Further information,
              including an updated list of main speakers,
is available
