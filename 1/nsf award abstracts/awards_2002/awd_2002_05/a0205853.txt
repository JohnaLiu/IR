With a number of upgrades coming to the Arecibo
              Observatory telescope of the National Astronomy and Ionospheric Center in the
              next year, the Observatory is poised to carry out a large-scale deep survey for
              new pulsars. Current estimates are that about 1000 new pulsars will be
              discovered. The system will have high sensitivity to the fastest pulsars and to
              compact binaries with orbital periods less than a few hours and with every
              possible kind of companion including black holes. There are implications for
              detailed modeling of the magnetic field and ionic distribution in our Galaxy,
              defining the Galaxy's spiral arms, and gravitational wave studies of compact
              binaries. This project will lay the groundwork for the survey through a survey
              design and pilot observations, developing data processing software, and
              investigating radio frequency interference mitigation techniques.
