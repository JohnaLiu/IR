Abstract    :
              EIA-0205663 University of Colorado Charbel Farhat ITR:  A Data Driven
              Environment for
Multiphysics Applications

The objective of this project is
              to enable an efficient prediction capability for the response of multiscale
              interdisciplinary continuous interacting systems.  This will be done by an
              effective union of information technologies, coupled multiphysics sciences, and
              automated massive experimentation for data gathering to steer adaptive modeling
              of the observed systemic behavior.
