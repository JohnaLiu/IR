Abstract    :
              This project will develop a new, integrative theory of software problem
              management by studying software
problems in their ongoing sociotechnical
              contexts. The researchers willcomparatively analyze large bodies (gigabytes) of
              longitudinalproblem-report data from open-source software development projects
              such as networked computer games, Internet/Web infrastructure, X-ray
              astronomy/deep space imaging, and academic software research, using
              grounded-theory and automated concept, data, and text-mining
methods. The
              project will analyze instances of (mis-)alignment between software artifacts,
              problem episodes, problem-management activities, problem-management
              infrastructure, and underlying social
organization. Explanatory models will be
              built by linking patterns of (mis-)alignment among these elements to outcomes
              such as ease-of-repair, persistence of problems, amount of information
              exchanged, kinds of skills needed, and structure of social organization.  The
              resulting models can guide the development of new
tools, infrastructures, and
              organizational practices for software. They will also provide new perspectives
              on community-wide practices of capturing and managing knowledge. This research
              will provide a conceptual shift in understanding how system development and use
              are bound together with the richness, variety, and temporal evolution of the
              socio-technical contexts provided by the global software industry.
