Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the physical layer of digital communication
system
              design - in particular on the design of graph-based error
control coding
              techniques for noisy, fading channels, such as those
encountered in wireless
              communication systems.  The research
addresses those issues that have made
              practical implementation of
graph-based coding techniques problematic.  Those
              issues include:

The development of LDPC and turbo codes with algebraic
              structure,
suitable for high speed implementation.
The development of LDPC
              and turbo codes with moderate block length,
suitable for practical real-time
              applications.
The design of bandwidth efficient coded modulation
              schemes
incorporating these new code constructions in order to "fatten
              the
bit pipe" in high data rate applications.
The adaptation of these new
              coding schemes for use in the fading
environment that characterizes wireless
              channels.
