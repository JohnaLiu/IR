Abstract    :
              The volume of hypertext on the World Wide Web is dwarfed by the amount
of data
              made available in networked databases, which has been estimated to be 400 to
              550 times larger than the WWW hypertext.  This proposal refers to this data as
              the Federated Facts and Figures on the Internet, or simply the FFF. The goal of
              this work is to explore the mechanisms for -- and consequences of --
              aggressively leveraging this resource.

The proposal has three aspects. 
              First, it describes algorithms and systems for exploiting facts and figures on
              the Internet.  In particular, it proposes adaptive query processing for the
              Telegraph system, to adjust to the volatility characteristic of the Internet. 
              It also proposes extending Telegraph to ``trawl'' large amounts of data from
              the FFF, by running recursive queries over multiple data sources.  The second
              goal of the proposal is to explore the ramifications of providing FFF tools to
              the broad Internet user base.  This includes an investigation of policy -- both
              social and technical -- and the economic incentives and ramifications
              surrounding such policies.  The third goal is to explore the design space of
              countermeasures that can prevent FFF technologies from being misused.
