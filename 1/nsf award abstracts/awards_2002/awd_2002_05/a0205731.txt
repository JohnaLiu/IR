Abstract    :
              
This project focuses on innovative algorithms for generating highly expressive
              synthetic speech.  Current text-to-speech synthesis  (TTS) systems generate
              speech that lacks expressiveness.  This is a serious obstacle for the potential
              application of TTS to computer based language and speech remediation for
              children.  Using TTS has these advantages over recorded speech, which is
              currently the standard in remedial systems:  (i) TTS provides complete
              flexibility in textual materials, and enables interactivity and
              individualization, which are both key for successful language teaching and
              remediation. (ii) TTS output can be modified more easily and along far more
              dimensions than recorded speech, including temporal, intonational, and spectral
              dimensions, so that speech output can be adjusted to a child's individual
              pattern of needs.
Generating expressive speech involves three hard research
              problems. (i) Computation of abstract tags that specify, e.g., which words need
              emphasis, and phrasing (e.g., where to pause). (ii) Based on these tags, the
              system has to compute a fundamental frequency contour.   (iii) Severe
              modification of the stored speech fragments ("acoustic units") to obtain these
              contours.
The central goal of the project is to address these research
              problems, and create a TTS system that will make the next generation of TTS
              based remedial systems viable.
