Abstract    :
              The proposal requests funding for partial support for U.S. scientists to attend
              two sequential high energy physics conferences in Les Arcs, Savoie, France. The
              first conference addresses Electroweak Interactions and Unified Theories. The
              subjects are CP violation, heavy flavor physics, neutrino physics, tests of the
              Standard Model, searches for new particles and theories beyond the Standard
              Model.

The second conference concerns Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and High
              Energy Hadronic Interactions. The topics to be covered include heavy flavor
              physics, structure functions, diffractive phenomena, low-x physics and
              saturation, tests of perturbative QCD, heavy ion collisions, the search for new
              phenomena and physics at future accelerators.
