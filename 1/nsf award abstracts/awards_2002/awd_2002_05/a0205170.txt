Abstract    :
              Richard Byrd and Robert Schnabel of U. Colorado, and Teresa Head-Gordon and
              Silvia Crivelli of UC-Berkeley are supported by the Chemistry Divsion through
              the Information Technology Research Initiative to develop a global optimization
              package for protein structure prediction.  Their approach combines optimization
              research from numerical computation, energy-modeling research from
              computational biophysics, and parallel computation research from computer
              science.  Key features of this research include a novel representation of the
              aqueous solvent, incorporation of secondary structure prediction, and
              energy-smoothing models to increase accuracy and efficiency.

The prediction
              of the three-dimensional shape, or native state, of a protein given its
              sequence of amino acids is one of the fundamental challenges of modern science.
              Protein structure knowledge is fundamental in understanding protein function,
              and important to many biomedical and biomaterial applications.  This research
              will result in advances in large-scale and parallel numerical computation, and
              models and prediction methods for computational biophysics.
