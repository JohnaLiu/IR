Star formation in starburst galaxies is dominated by
              super star clusters (SSCs) whose sizes and masses are comparable to those of
              globular clusters, suggesting that SSCs may be young globular clusters.  There
              are many outstanding questions in this field: What physical conditions lead to
              the formation of SSCs? How does this mode of star formation fit into our
              paradigm for Galactic star formation? What fraction of stars forms in SSCs?
              What is the connection between SSCs and globular clusters? 

The centerpiece
              of this work is an IR spectroscopic and imaging study of the SSC population in
              the nearest starburst merger, the Antennae Galaxies, using observing time which
              has been awarded on the Gemini and Keck telescopes. The youngest SSCs in the
              Antennae are concentrated in the dusty overlap region between the two nuclei
              where giant molecular cloud complexes reside and where the mid-IR intensity
              peaks. The infrared observations to be conducted here, which suffer an order of
              magnitude less extinction than previous Hubble Space Telescope data, are
              essential to reduce the systematic errors associated with reddening and to
              quantify the properties of SSCs over the full range of ages and
              extinctions.
