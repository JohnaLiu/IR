0205330

The design, planning, control and management of high
              performance networks require a much more integrated approach than the
              conventional layered approach, where each layer is designed and optimized
              independently from the others. In this proposal the researchers propose to
              exploit inter-layer dependencies in network protocols for improved network
              performance. In particular, the researchers will focus on ad-hoc wireless
              networks, in which these interdependencies are more pronounced and in which the
              network will benefit significantly by crosslayer designs.

The main focus is
              on the interaction between the physical layer, the MAC layer, and the
              routing/transport layers. The researchers take into account the nature of the
              wireless medium by detailed modeling of the transmission parameters and of the
              detector structure and consider both TDMA(scheduled) and
              CDMAmedia-accesscontrol mechanisms. The researchers couple these with the flow
              and route assignment problems and, furthermore,  consider how the transport
              protocol interacts with route selection and bandwidth allocation.

In
              addition, the researchers address the role of network control and management in
              ad-hoc wireless networks and exploit its interaction with the aforementioned
              layers. Finally, the researchers consider the interaction of signal compression
              with rate and quality control and are mindful of the energy consumption
              repercussions of the joint protocol design.
