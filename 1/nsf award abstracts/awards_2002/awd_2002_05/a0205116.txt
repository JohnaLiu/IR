ITR: Special Focus on Computer
              Science and Epidemiology

Mathematical methods have become important tools in
              analyzing the spread and control of infectious and also noninfectious diseases.
               The size of modern epidemiological problems and the large data sets that arise
              call out for the use of powerful computational tools in conjunction with the
              mathematical analysis.  This project believes that partnerships between
              computer scientists and epidemiologists can make important new contributions to
              the usefulness of these mathematical methods.

Research efforts in the
              project will be carried out by interdisciplinary, international working groups
              which will investigate issues in computer science and related mathematics that
              need to be resolved to make progress on important problems in epidemiology and
              will explore and apply methods of computer science and related mathematics not
              widely used in epidemiology.  Topics to be studied by these groups include: 
              Adverse Event/Disease Reporting, Surveillance, and Analysis; Data Mining and
              Epidemiology; Analogies Between Computer Viruses and Immune Systems and
              Biological Viruses and Immune Systems; Distributed Computing, Social Networks,
              and Disease Spread Processes; Phylogenetic Trees and Rapidly Evolving Diseases,
              Spatio-Temporal and Network Modeling of Diseases; and Methodologies for
              Comparing Vaccination Strategies.  

Other important goals will be to involve
              more computer scientists in epidemiological research; develop and strengthen
              collaborations and partnerships between mathematical scientists and biological
              scientists; introduce young investigators from both the computer science and
              biological science communities to the issues, problems and challenges of
              epidemiology; and involve biological and computer scientists together to define
              the agenda and develop the tools of computational epidemiology.
