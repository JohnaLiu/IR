The interstellar medium is enriched with chemical
              elements synthesized in the interiors of stars and dust grains formed in their
              atmospheres.  Stars accomplish this enrichment through mass outflows ranging in
              character from slow winds in post-main sequence, luminous evolved stars that
              operate over long time scales, to explosive events such as novae. By observing
              these outflows the process of chemical enrichment can be investigated. In
              particular IR observations will be carried out to provide abundance estimates
              for elements in the ejecta, such as C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, and Si, that can be
              used to assess the contributions of stellar winds to the interstellar medium.
              For a nova event prompt observations of sudden, transient activity at many
              wavelengths are required.  This study will provide information about the stages
              of stellar evolution that are associated with mass loss, characterize the
              physical properties of astrophysical dust grains in circumstellar outflows, and
              assess the contributions that novae and luminous IR variable stars make to the
              grains and gas that constitute the interstellar medium.
