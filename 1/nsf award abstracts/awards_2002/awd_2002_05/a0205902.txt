The set of interacting binary star systems called
              cataclysmic variables serves as a marvelous laboratory to study how
              astrophysical accretion processes work. In that group of binaries are a number
              of broad categories of objects, each category further divided into classes of
              objects of different outburst and quiescence behaviors. Significant amounts of 
              observational effort has been expended in an attempt to understand the
              underlying accretion physics in these systems  Now once seemingly intractable
              computational problems are accessible via better algorithms and desktop
              supercomputing with 3-dimensional hydrodynamic codes, and progress has been
              made.

This project will advance efforts to model a particular, and for a
              long-while puzzling, phenomenon observed in SU Ursa Majoris-type systems:
              so-called superhumps observed during especially bright outbursts. The PI has
              successfully modeled approximate  superhump behavior using his smoothed
              particle hydrodynamic code in a fully 3-dimensional mode.  The superhumps in
              light curves  are true instabilities of  tilted accretion disks. This project
              will expand the work by adding disk viscosity due to magnetic fields and
              creating a grid of light curves and modeled disks that will be delivered to the
              astronomy community as an atlas.
