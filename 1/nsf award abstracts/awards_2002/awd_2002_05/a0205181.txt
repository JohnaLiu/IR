Abstract    :
              EIA-0205181 J. Tinsley Oden University of Texas, Austin  ITR/AP:  A COMPILATION
              INFRASTRUCTURE FOR RELIABLE COMPUTER SIMULATIONS

The research of this
              project will develop mathematical and computational processes for validation
              analogous to those used for verification and evaluate these processes by actual
              and computational experiments.  At the core of the proposed integrated
              framework for verification and validation lies the concept of hierarchical
              modeling.  Hierarchical modeling is a systematic coarsening of mathematical
              models from a base model which is known a priori to contain all of the
              information, which can be extracted from a given experiment to within
              quantifiable bounds.  The goal is to determine, by introducing approximations
              into the base model, the computationally simplest model which contains the
              information content of the experiment.  This process requires an ability to
              evaluate the error introduced by each approximation to the base model, a
              capability for capturing the semantic content of both models and experiments, a
              capability for comparing the information content of the experiments and
              simulations and a capability for implementing a family of computational systems
              implementing the sequence of models so that the conceptual process can be
              realized and evaluated.
