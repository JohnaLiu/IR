Abstract    :
              This project is a multidisciplinary, international collaborative research
              project aimed at developing a fully automated robotic system for on demand and
              batch scanning of print materials and an open-source software framework that
              will begin with a printed work and end with digital images, text and musical
              content suitable for digital libraries.
