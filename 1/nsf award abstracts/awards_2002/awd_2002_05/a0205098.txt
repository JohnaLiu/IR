This workshop is designed to foster communication
              between the grantees of the QuBIC program, the ITR Revolutionary Computer
              program, and the DARPA Bio-Comp program in the areas of DNA and biomolecular
              computing.  This workshop will be the primary forum for the exchange of
              research ideas, and interaction between EIA and its grantees.
