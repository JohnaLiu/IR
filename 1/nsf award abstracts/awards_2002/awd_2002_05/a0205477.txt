Abstract    :
              The problems of 3D shape representation, analysis, manipulation,
and estimation
              from unstructured sensor data are central not only
to computer vision, but are
              also of key significance to geometric
modeling, computer graphics,
              computational geometry, medical imaging,
surveillance, among others. The goal
              of this proposal is to investigate
approaches to these problems in the context
              of tackling certain
key problems in archaeology.  This area of application
              offers
the following three distinct advantages: (i) it is a rich source
of
              free-form shapes, e.g., pottery sherds, marble plates and reliefs,
sculpture,
              column capitals, building facades, etc., which are
easily accessible, in
              contrast to 3D free-form shapes obtained
from medical images which require
              expert segmentation; this data
is also richer and more variable than data
              available in a typical
manufacturing environ-ment; (ii) the problems are of a
              generic
nature and the proposed approaches can be applied to a variety
of
              other domains; (iii) this application area forms a key bridge
between the
              Physical Sciences and the Humanities.
