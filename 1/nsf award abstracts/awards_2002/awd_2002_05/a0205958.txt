Abstract    :
              This project will compare and contrast the magnetospheres of the Earth, Jupiter
              and its satellite, Ganymede.  The study will provide a theoretical framework
              for understanding the roles that are played by the different sizes and rotation
              rates of the three objects.  The project will involve analytic theory, data
              analysis and numerical simulations using a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code.  One
              of the important issues to be addressed is the role of magnetic flux tube
              interchange, which has been observed in Jupiter's magnetosphere but may or may
              not play a role in the Earth's magnetosphere.
