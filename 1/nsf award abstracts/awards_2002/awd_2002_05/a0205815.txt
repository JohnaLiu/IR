Beers, Timothy C.

Dr. Beers is awarded funds at Michigan State
              University to work with collaborators at the University of Texas at Austin and
              Ohio State University.  This team will lay the groundwork for a more detailed
              understanding of how our Milky Way galaxy formed and evolved. Models of galaxy
              formation and evolution depend on understanding the motions and chemical
              enrichment of local main-sequence stars that are far lower in heavy elements
              than ordinary stars,  and how these stars compare to globular cluster stars.
              The known sample of these "subdwarfs" is very small.

Dr. Beers and
              collaborators will study a new sample of these subdwarf stars in the
Galaxy's
              halo and thick disk; this sample represents a huge increase over the number of
              subdwarfs previously studied.  The investigators will obtain accurate and
              self-consistent measures of temperature, reddening, and composition for a
              critically selected sample of approximately 150 subdwarfs identified in recent
              surveys for metal-poor stars. They will also apply theoretical models to
              explore the dependence of the main-sequence luminosity on detailed stellar
              chemical composition.  The results will be used to improve the temperature and
              abundance scales of globular cluster main sequences for comparison to
              spectroscopic determinations on the giant branch, and to thus determine the
              relative ages and distances of globular clusters.
