Abstract    :
              Large-scale coordination tasks are becoming increasingly important in hazardous,
              uncertain, and time-stressed environments such as rescue operations and
              disaster response. In such environments, human rescuers must rapidly make
              decisions while under stress and with incomplete and dynamic information, that
              may save or put lives at risk. The proposed multidisciplinary research is
              founded on three key advances/technical ideas. 1) Teams of Autonomous Agents:
              Cyber Agents, Robots and People (CARPs) are hybrid teams that consist of large
              number of these entities, distributed in space and time and varying in
              capability and role. (2) A cooperative control paradigm facilitates the sharing
              of a) common goals, b) initiatives for communication and action, c)
              responsibilities for coherent group activity, d) information on the
              environment, mission, and situation, and e) assistance to overcoming barriers
              for various members of CARP groups whether human, robot or cyber-agent. (3) The
              key challenges for team formation and coordination in large-scale, uncertain
              coordination domains include ad hoc interoperability across different agents,
              teams and organizations that are brought together "as is", and co-adaptation to
              each other and to changing priorities and roles within the team. The impact of
              having CARP technology successfully deployed will allow robots to advance
              beyond niche roles in a handful of industries; instead they will be integrated
              into the larger society of humans and information systems in the workplace. 
              Emergency response teams are an early high-payoff test domain as robots can go
              places normally dangerous to humans, thus saving rescuers' and victims' lives.
