Abstract    :
              In this project, a number of outstanding issues related to the OH/HO2 chemistry
              in the upper stratosphere and lower mesophere will be investigated.  Current
              understanding of the HOx chemistry in this region of the atmosphere is
              complicated because standard photochemical models or any modifications of them
              are unable to consistently account for the odd hydrogen abundance above and
              below the stratopause.  This is due, in part, to uncertainties in the rate
              coefficients of the reactions that determine the OH/HO2 ratio in the
              stratosphere and mesosphere, and or due to the lack of full understanding of
              the HOx chemistry.  The key reactions that partition the OH/HO2 abundance in
              the stratosphere and mesosphere whose rate coefficients have come under
              increased scrutiny in recent years will be investigated.  Rate coefficients for
              the reaction between vibrationally excited H2 and O(3P) atoms which has
              recently been proposed as a novel source of OH in the mesosphere will be
              evaluated using explicit quantum mechanical calculations.  Nonthermal energy
              distribution functions of O(3P) atoms in the mesosphere and their contributions
              to OH formation in O(3P)+H2 collisions will be determined.  Further, quenching
              of vibrationally excited OH produced by the reaction between hydrogen atoms and
              ozone will be investigated.
