Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, is a fundamental computational study of the chemisorption of small
              molecules on transition metal surfaces.  Using state of the art Density
              Functional Theory, Professor Rahman and her coworkers in the Department of
              Physics at Kansas State University, are systematically exploring the adsorption
              of carbon monoxide on stepped and kinked nickel and palladium surfaces.  The
              dependence of adsorbate binding energy, substrate surface relaxations,
              electronic charge transfer and the nature of the adsorbate-substrate bond on
              the local geometry and coordination obtained from these calculations is being
              explored.  Model interaction potentials developed from these calculations
              facilitate large scale simulations of catalysis and thin film growth processes.
               

Using state of the art computational tools, Professor Rahman and her
              colleagues are examining the fundamental aspects of electronic structure in the
              adsorption of small molecules on transition metal surfaces.  The detailed
              understanding obtained from these studies is useful in the design of catalytic
              systems and for developing our knowledge of surface reaction processes in
              several technologically important areas.
