This grant will support research
              related to citizen learning and participation in communities and government
              using Internet-based information technologies and tools. This is a
              multidisciplinary proposal with participants from Public Policy and Management,
              Philosophy, Political Science, Social Psychology and Computer Science. A
              variety of free software will be developed to foster collaborative information
              sharing, structured discussions and community decision-making through shared
              data, chat sessions, video conferencing and other information modes. The
              software is not an end in itself, but rather will serve to support research by
              the PIs addressing some of the well-known problems of computer-mediated
              communications, such as poor transmission of social cues, usability,
              accountability, and access inequalities. These problems will be studied within
              two larger contexts, Community Effects and Decisions Quality Effects, and two
              levels of physical community, on-campus, and off-campus (but still within the
              Pittsburgh local community). The software will be robustly built and intended
              for broad use beyond the project itself.
