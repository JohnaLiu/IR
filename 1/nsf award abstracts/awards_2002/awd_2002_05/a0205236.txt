Abstract    :
              This ITR proposal supports a focused and coordinated effort over five years
              directed toward creating a 32 qubit quantum processor using individually
              addressable neutral Rb atoms trapped by laser beams on a two-dimensional
              lattice. It builds on recent very promising, but experimentally undemonstrated,
              theoretical concepts about manipulating the quantum coupling between atoms
              using lasers and highly excited atomic states.  The team will use a
              reconfigurable atomic lattice defined by the beams from holographic optical
              elements. With a site to site spacing of 7 microns each qubit is individually
              addressable. Qubits are represented by hyperfine ground state levels and
              arbitrary state vector rotations are performed using laser pulses. The
              conditional two-qubit interaction that is needed for a complete set of logical
              primitives is achieved by exciting to a high lying atomic Rydberg level.  A
              novel aspect of the implementation of these concepts is the exploitation of the
              dipole-blockade to allow massively sub-Poissonian loading of the qubit sites.
              The project is a collaboration between the Physics and Computer Sciences
              departments at The University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Electrical
              Engineering department at The University of Colorado Boulder.
