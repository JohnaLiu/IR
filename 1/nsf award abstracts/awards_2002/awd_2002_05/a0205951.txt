Abstract    :
              PI Cohen

More than 20 years ago it was discovered that the tip of the giant
              branch in some galactic globular clusters is populated by stars which show wide
              variations in C, N, and O abundances. Subsequently less strong, but still real,
              variations in Na, Al and Mg were detected among the same stars. The goal of
              this project is to determine the variations of abundances of elements in metal
              poor stars, concentrating first on globular clusters, as a function of
              luminosity and evolutionary state. Our ability to explain and reproduce such
              variations is a stringent test of our understanding of many aspects of stellar
              evolution as well as of the early chemical history of the Galaxy. It is a test
              we sometimes fail.  
   In previous work anticorrelated variations of O and Na
              were found in the globular cluster M71. Furthermore large anticorrelated
              variations in CH and CN also were found contrary to predictions by stellar
              evolution theory.  The present project will continue and expand this work to
              more metal poor globular clusters, where the distinction between star-to-star
              abundance variations arising from dredge up versus primordial variations should
              be clearer. In addition, the study will extend to more metal poor clusters the
              work on the CH and CN bands to as low a luminosity as possible. In a related
              major program the abundance distributions and scatter among the most metal poor
              stars in the Galaxy, those with [Fe/H] =.3.0 dex, are being studied.
