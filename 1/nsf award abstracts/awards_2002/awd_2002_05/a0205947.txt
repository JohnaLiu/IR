Abstract    :
              This project addresses three questions: 1) How can we transform introductory
              math and science courses to provide a more interactive experience for students
              within the financial constraints of a large state university? 2) In what ways
              can information technology be used effectively to improve undergraduate science
              education? and 3) How can research departments and schools of education work
              together effectively to recruit and train talented students into careers in
              K-12 math and science education? The author of this proposal has developed a
              transformed section of introductory undergraduate astronomy that emphasizes
              inquiry-based and collaborative learning with the aid of web-based information
              technology. Key elements of the transformed class include: a) Replacing
              lectures with content delivery through a web-based hypertext that is rich in
              multimedia simulations and links for exploration; b) Dividing a large (~200
              students) class into "learning teams" of ~12 students each who meet once a week
              in a computer classroom to prepare answers to pre-posed "discussion questions"
              and so work collaboratively on team projects; c) Software and course design to
              facilitate synchronous and asynchronous communication among students in
              learning teams; d) Blocks of instruction for inquiry-based collaborative
              learning using Java-based simulations; and e) The employment of undergraduate
              learning assistants to supervise the learning teams. The author has also worked
              with faculty from other science and math research departments and faculty of
              the school of education in a collaboration with Sun Educational Systems to
              employ undergraduate and graduate students, programmers, and in-service
              teachers in summer internships at Sun to develop Java-based blocks of
              instruction intended for secondary school math and science education and to
              test these blocks in local school districts. The current project extends this
              work in the following directions: a) The author is continuing to improve and
              develop the transformed astronomy course, making the resources available and
              easy to use for other faculty members in the department; b) The author is
              working with the administration faculty in other math and science departments
              at the University of Colorado to help them adopt some of the methodology of the
              transformed course, including software and the employment of undergraduate
              learning assistants for their own introductory courses; c) The author is
              working with the administration, faculty in science and mathematics research
              departments, faculty in the School of Education, and with Sun Educational
              Systems to develop an attractive undergraduate curriculum to recruit and train
              talented students for careers in K-12 science and mathematics education.
