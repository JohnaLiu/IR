Abstract    :
              EIA-0205327 David E. Evans University of Virginia  ITR:  A Framework for
              Environment-Aware, Massively Distributed Computing 

We propose to develop a
              programming language for swarms of devices that allows a programmer to express
              an application in terms of desired aggregate behavior rather than explicitly
              programming individual devices.  We will produce a program synthesizer that
              automatically generates the appropriate device programs that will implement the
              aggregate behavior for a particular deployment.  The program synthesizer draws
              from a library of primitives that can be combined to produce complex
              applications with known scaling and non-functional properties.  In addition to
              analytical results, we will test our approach using simulations and using a
              physical swarm composed of wireless devices with sensors and actuators.
