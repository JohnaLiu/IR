Abstract    :
              This project focuses on compiler-enabled power-aware architectures. 
Its
              purpose is to leverage static program information in smart ways, 
to reduce
              power and energy consumption in both embeddded
and general-purpose
              architectures.
We follow three key general ideas to achieve this goal:
(1) we
              use static information to throttle processor resources,
(2) we incorporate
              architectural features to directly support static
compiler managed modes of
              operation, and
(3) we leverage speculative static information in addition
              to
the predictable static information to support (1) and (2).   

We have
              demonstrated, in a number of processor architectural domains, 
that our
              approach is feasible, and can be easily implemented, and that 
considerable
              energy savings, beyond what would be possible with circuit
and architectural
              techniques alone, can be achieved.
We estimate that our techniques if
              combined,  can give an additional  
30% or more energy savings compared to
              state-of-the-art low-power 
designs, while not significantly affecting
              performance.
