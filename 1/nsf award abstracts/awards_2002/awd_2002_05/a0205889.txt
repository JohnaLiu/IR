Abstract    :
              The Newburgh ASCEND program will provide 220 students per year in grades 7-9
              with an opportunity to engage in inquiry-based science activities using units
              called "Workplace Simulations."  The "Simulations" will focus on earth and life
              sciences in year 1 and physics and chemistry in year 2, and will emphasize
              career exploration in addition to the science content.  All content is aligned
              with New York State Learning Standards and emphasizes topics of interest to
              youth such as ecology, botany, aquatic science, paleontology, ornithology,
              archaeology and forensic science.  Students will also learn how to utilize GIS
              software and the use of a scanning electron microscope.  Many activities will
              focus on problem-solving skills and research methodology.  One Saturday per
              month participants will be engaged in field trips and field-based research. 
              During the summer, half of the students will participate in two-week summer
              sessions that enable them to explore topics in more detail, engage in career
              explorations and meet face-to-face with scientists and engineers in a relaxed
              setting.
