This award to Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia
              University in the City of New York provides instrumentation to significantly
              improve the geophysical survey capabilities of the research vessel Maurice
              Ewing, an NSF-owned ship operated by LDEO as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  The navigation and quality
              control software and other instrumentation supported here will improve survey
              capabilities and upgrade reliability of R/V Ewing for conducting geophysical
              research programs. These improvements will be of substantial advantage to
              marine scientists using the ship in their research during 2002 and future
              years.
