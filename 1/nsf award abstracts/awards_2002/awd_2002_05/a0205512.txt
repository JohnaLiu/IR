Abstract    :
              The origin of eukaryotes, organisms with distinct subcellular structures
              isolated by membranes, is a significant discussion in evolutionary biology.  If
              Bacteria and Archaea are prokaryotic domains of life, then a core of eukaryotic
              signature proteins, having no detectable homology to known prokaryotic proteins
              should exist.  Using both sequence-and sequence/structure based methods, this
              proposal will examine the phylogenetic origins of eukaryotic proteins.  From
              initial students a preliminary candidate list of proteins has been assembled. 
              Confirming or denying the membership of a protein or protein domain in the set
              is the goal of this work.  Some of the required software, particularly Bayesian
              prior-based profiles and domain dissection tools have been begun.  These will
              be refined for use in remote homology, where sequence similarity has virtually
              disappeared.  The results of this study, which will be accessible in
              publication and web, will provide data to inform and constrain the theories
              about the origins of eukaryotes and the mechanisms of expansion of the
              eukaryotic proteome.
