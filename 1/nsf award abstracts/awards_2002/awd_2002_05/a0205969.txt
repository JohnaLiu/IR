Over the past ten years, our basic ideas about how galaxies
              form has reached a consensus.  This "standard" model has been able to explain
              numerous and varied observations of galaxies.  However, four vexing problems
              remain. These problems arise from predictions made using computer simulations.
              This has led some researchers to significantly alter or abandon this otherwise
              very successful standard model. However, computer simulations are not perfect,
              and it has recently been shown that correctly simulating the dynamics of
              galaxies and their dark matter halos is much more difficult than previously
              realized. Hence the cause of these problems could be purely numerical in
              nature.  Alternatively, the cause of these problems could be physical effects
              which are not properly included in the simulations.

Dr Katz and his
              collaborators will study the origin of these problems and possible solutions to
              try and assess whether or not the standard model for galaxy formation should be
              changed or abandoned. They will use numerical simulations of ever increasing
              realism and novel numerical techniques to study these subtle dynamical
              processes and their impact on the above problems.
