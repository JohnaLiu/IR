Black holes are tremendously powerful sources of light. 
              In aggregate, the total light power produced by black holes in the Universe is
              almost as much as that generated by stars.  However, the mechanism by which
              black holes are able to radiate so much light has remained mysterious for many
              years. The fundamental reason for this mystery is that, without friction,
              matter in orbit around a massive object would go round and round forever, and
              no energy would be released at all.   Except for the region immediately outside
              its edge, this rule is as true for a black hole as for an ordinary object.
              Because friction caused by ordinary viscosity is far too weak to account for
              the observed rate at which mass is swallowed by black holes; the source of this
              friction had been a mystery for decades.  During the 1990s, however, we
              gradually gained confidence in what was once the speculative suggestion that
              tangled magnetic fields would spontaneously grow in strength in accreting
              matter, and the forces they create would be strong enough to provide the
              necessary "friction".

Since calculations of tangled magnetic field forces
              are very complex they must be done with large computer simulations. This
              project will conduct a coherent program of large-scale numerical simulations
              with a pair of goals: a) to compute how the magnetic forces control the total
              amount of energy released in black hole accretion; and b) to show how the
              released energy finds its way into heat, and then the light that we see.
