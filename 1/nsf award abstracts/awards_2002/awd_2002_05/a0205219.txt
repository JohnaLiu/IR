Abstract    :
              CareMedia provides automated video and sensor analysis for geriatric care.
              Through activity and environmental monitoring in a skilled nursing facility, a
              continuous, voluminous audio and video record is captured. Through work in
              information extraction, behavior analysis and synthesis, this record is
              transformed into an information asset whose efficient, secure presentation
              empowers geriatric care specialists with greater insights into problems,
              effectiveness of treatments, and determination of 
environmental and social
              influences. CareMedia allows the behavior of senile dementia patients to be
              more accurately interpreted through intelligent browsing tools and filtered
              audiovisual evidence, leading to 
treatment that reduces agitation while
              allowing awareness and responsiveness. The research begins with disruptive
              vocalization, a particular behavior noted across senile dementia assessment
              scales. The 
coverage is then broadened ambitiously to integrate sensor and
              visual data for behavioral analysis and summarization in support of OBRA
              regulations requiring behavior management strategies that are not just chemical
              restraints. This effort includes automatic techniques to recognize disruptive
              vocalizations, more complex behavioral occurrences such as falls or physical
              aggression, and circadian patterns of activity. This research builds on key
              Carnegie Mellon research efforts in digital video analysis, wearable mobile
              computers, computer-based vision systems, and information retrieval systems for
              multimedia metadata.
