This research pursues the development of a network of
              robots with cameras and
their optimal, dynamic positioning for monitoring a
              cluttered scene, under different conditions of visibility. The robots must
              discover their neighbors, localize 
themselves with respect to their neighbors
              and integrate information with that
available from the other members of the
              team on the fly. Further this information 
must allow a remotely located human
              operator to immerse herself in the
environment. The project addresses the
              development of enabling algorithms and
technology tailored to such
              applications as fire-fighting.
