Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has demonstrated
              that it is an unsurpassed resource for finding low mass stars, brown dwarfs and
              close binaries such as cataclysmic variables. This project will use the ongoing
              SDSS photometric and spectroscopic data during the next 3 years to amass a
              large database on low mass stars, both single and in close binaries. Additional
              follow-up data will be obtained. Undergraduate and graduate students will
              participate in the observations and analysis of the data. An on-line database
              will be made available for scientists, the public, and outreach activities.


                Measurements of the magnitudes, colors, spectral types, magnetic activity
              levels, rotation rates and ages of the late type stars will be used to infer
              basic physical properties (temperature, luminosity, mass and strength of the
              magnetic dynamo), which then will be compared for objects at different
              evolutionary stages in both single and close binary environments to assess the
              dependence of magnetic activity on rotation rate, to discover and characterize
              close interacting binary systems with lower mass secondaries than have
              previously been found,  study the influence of irradiation on the low mass
              secondaries in close binaries, to determine if this strongly affects the
              outbursts in cataclysmic variables, and to  determine the space density and
              luminosity function of low mass single stars compared with their counterparts
              in binary systems.
