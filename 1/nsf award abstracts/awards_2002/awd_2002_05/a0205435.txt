Abstract    :
              Today's global economy is characterized by changing market demands, short
              product lifecycles, and fine-grained customization. This context demands a
              capability to identify promising supply chain partners and adapt existing
              relationships in response to dynamic conditions. One major impediment is the
              multiplicity of considerations that bear on supply chain decisions. For
              example, a material supply contract might specify price, quantity, delivery
              time and mode, quality, warranty, and many other features. Most of today's
              auction systems support one-dimensional negotiations where price and quantity
              are the only features determined dynamically. This project aims to support
              negotiation over many attributes in dynamic, multilevel supply chains. To this
              end, it will develop flexible languages for expressing multiattribute offers,
              general two-sided matching mechanisms supporting both iterative and one-shot
              negotiation, and real-time decision support based on summarized assessments of
              production states. The new techniques will be validated using an agent-based
              supply chain simulation testbed, as well as analytical models. The resulting
              methods will enable a future where companies routinely form and adapt supply
              chain relationships for a broad range of productive activities. The systemic
              ability to respond dynamically to changing conditions can ultimately lower
              costs, while delivering greater value through increased customization and
              responsiveness to novel opportunities.
