Gaustad

Dr. John Gaustad, at Swarthmore College, recently
              completed a Southern H-Alpha Sky Survey Atlas (SHASSA).  The images in this
              atlas have a resolution of 0.8 arcminutes and sensitivity of 2 rayleighs per
              pixel.  Dr. Gaustad will now use the same robotic camera system to obtain
              comparable images of the brighter H-alpha regions in an emission line of
              ionized sulfur (SII).  The SII/H-alpha ratio is a useful discriminator between
              regions that are heated by the ultraviolet light of embedded stars and regions
              that are heated by supersonic shock waves produced by supernova remnants and
              stellar winds.  These measurements will contribute to understanding the
              astrophysical nature of ionized regions in the interstellar medium of the
              Galaxy.
