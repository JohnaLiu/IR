              PROPOSAL ABSTRACT

Scalable Molecular Electronics

     We are approaching
              the end of a remarkably successful era in computing: The era where Moore's Law
              reigns, where processing power per dollar doubles every year. This success is
              based in large part on advances in complementary metal-oxide semiconductor
              (CMOS)-based integrated circuits. Although we have come to expect, and plan
              for, the exponential increase in processing power in our everyday lives, today
              Moore's Law faces imminent challenges both from the physics of deep-submicron
              CMOS devices and from the enormous costs of chip masks and next-generation
              fabrication plants.
     A promising alternative to CMOS-based computing being
              investigated is chemically assembled electronic nanotechnology (CAEN).
              Electronic nanotechnology (EN) constructs electronic circuits out of
              nanometer-scale devices that take advantage of quantum-mechanical effects. The
              fundamental strategy of CAEN is to substitute compilation time (which is
              inexpensive) for manufacturing precision (which is ex-pensive). The research
              will be directed at integrating defect measurements with computer architecture
              and compiler technology to create circuits from chemically assembled
              structures.
     Using EN to build computer systems requires new ways of
              thinking about computing devices; spanning everything from circuits to
              compilers. Unlike conventional CMOS, CAEN cannot be used to construct complex
              structures. Instead, one fabricates dense regular (but potentially defective)
              structures, which we call nanoFabrics, that can be programmed after fabrication
              to implement complex circuits. The proposed research investigates how to scale
              CAEN to create useful computational devices with more than 10^10
              gate-equivalents per cm^2 by developing new circuit technology, reconfigurable
              computing, defect tolerance, architectural abstractions and innovative compiler
              technology While the researchers will not be designing the EN devices
              themselves, their goal is to show how they can be used to create computing
              devices and guide EN scientists in their development of the underlying
              technology. The investigators approach this problem at four levels:
    
              Logical Building Blocks: The researchers will develop models of EN devices and
              new circuit simulation technology that will allow predictions of performance
              across important metrics such as power, speed, density, area, and delay. These
              models will be used to design and determine the characteristics of logical
              circuit building blocks, nanoBlocks, for computing systems.
    
              Manufacturing: Due to the nature of EN and specifically CAEN fabrication, the
              devices will have defects. The investigators will develop methods which will
              allow systems based on EN devices to transparently work in the presence of such
              defects.
     Computer Architecture: The researchers will develop a hierarchy
              of abstract machines that support re-configurable computing and hide
              complexity. A split-phase abstract machine (SAM) will be used to partition
              programs into processes, which will be mapped to an abstract machine composed
              of tiles arranged on a 2-D grid. Each tile will contain four components: a
              finite state machine, a data path segment, a local memory, and a router. Tiles
              may be grouped together into a complete pipelined datapath. The tiles
              themselves will be implemented in nanoBlocks, the basic unit of the
              nanoFabric.
     Compilation: Compilation technology will be developed to map
              programs written in general-purpose programming languages, e.g. C or Java, to
              nanoFabrics. The research will focus on ensuring that the compiler will scale
              to nanoFabrics, which can have hundreds of millions of components. The compiler
              decomposes an application into a series of independent SAMs based on control
              flow and memory access patterns. They are developing a new intermediate
              representation with a precise semantics that turns all control flow into data
              flow. The IR unifies predication, speculation and static-single assignment and
              makes explicit data flow, control flow, and synchronization. This leads to an
              enormous simplification of many optimizations and provides the framework for
              formal translation and optimization validation of the compiler. 
     This
              research has the potential to utilize, and guide the development of, electronic
              nanotechnology to inexpensively produce low-power circuits a million times more
              dense than conventional CMOS circuits.
