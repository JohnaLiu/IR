Abstract    :
              This Interagency Argeement supports activities of the Interagency Arctic
              Research Policy Committee (IARPC) for which NSF has lead agency role.  These
              activities include editing and preparation of the camera copy of the Spring and
              Fall 2002 issues of the Journal, Arctic Research of the United States.  The
              Journal serves an essential step in fulfilling the requirements of Public Law
              98-373, the Arctic Research and Policy Act.  It contains information on
              research activities of the Federal agencies involved in the Arctic and reports
              and minutes of meetings from the Arctic Research Commission and IARPC.  Under
              this agreement, CRREL also provides editorial support services for the U.S.
              Arctic Research Plan and the IARPC.
