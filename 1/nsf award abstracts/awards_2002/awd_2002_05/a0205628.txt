Abstract    :

              Mining of Integrated Weather Data

The mission is to build systems and
              develop theory for extracting information and identifying patterns that are
              useful for making decision in real-time.  Funding is being requested to build
              pattern recognition techniques that will exploit multisensor data in an
              integrated manner to provide information such as the presence or absence of
              tornados, supercells and mesocyclones; estimate precipitation; predict the
              occurrence of flash floods; assimilate and display large volumes of multisensor
              data and trigger the archive of selected data sets.  These tasks will be
              accomplished by customizing and developing techniques for real-time data
              mining.  The approaches used will include traditional data reduction methods
              such as PCA and clustering;  Procrustes analysis; Kalman filters and non-linear
              time series analysis with regime switching; and, decomposition and robust
              optimization methods for training support vector machines.
