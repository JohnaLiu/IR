Abstract    :
              Conventional computer architecture has been based on and dominated by
              the
capacity poor systems we were forced to build 20 and 50 years ago. 
              For
over three decades, the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) has formed
              the
basic architectural abstraction for scalability.  As wonderful as the
              ISA
abstraction has been, its range of utility is coming to an end. 
              Our
systems have grown orders of magnitude in size and speed, and many of
              the
simplifying assumptions which underly the ISA are limiting
              forward
scalability rather than enabling them.  This effort explores
              a
reformulation of our basic assumptions and machine abstractions
              to
accommodate the large capacity computing systems we can now build. 
              Whereas
the sequence of primitive instructions was the core fixed point in
              ISA
model, this effort proposes stream-connected graphs as the model
              fixed
point for these Decentralized Streaming Architectures (DSA).  This
              way
communication is abstracted directly in the architecture
              facilitating
parallelism and optimization for physical locality.  DSA will
              give us a
single, unifying system model for future computing systems which
              scales
from modest, single-chip, single-processor systems, to multiprocessor
              ICs,
to a wide range of heterogeneous System-on-a-Chip designs, to
              large-scale,
heterogeneous, multi-component systems that evolve over decade
              long
lifecycles.
