Abstract    :
              This research project will examine the technologies and models required to
              enable rapid response electronic markets for time-sensitive goods. The research
              will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team from Management Science,
              Economics and Computer Science at the University of Maryland, and will include
              collaborators from industry: Avendra, GE Global Exchange and IBM. Time
              sensitive goods have an associated time attribute. Examples include aircraft
              landing time slots, tickets to entertainment events, and hotel rooms on a
              particular day. The project methodology includes (1) empirical analysis of
              electronic markets to understand the current state-of-art of models and
              technology, (2) design of market structures and mechanisms, (3) design of data
              delivery systems, (4) design of market software agents, and (5) implementation
              of project results. Before time-sensitive goods can be extensively traded in
              eMarketplaces, new market mechanisms (with extensions of economic theory), and
              rapid response IT technologies (with associated efficient optimization
              algorithms) are needed to handle these goods in an online environment, and to
              enable market agents (buyers and sellers) to reach "equilibrium" quickly.
              Integrating time-sensitive goods in disparate electronic marketplaces will
              require new advances in the design of data delivery systems, and will require
              significant changes in the fundamental propositions governing online agent
              behavior.
