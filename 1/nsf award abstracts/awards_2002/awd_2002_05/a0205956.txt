White dwarfs (WDs) are the most common collapsed
              objects produced as end points of stellar evolution. Their astrophysical
              behavior depends on their interior composition affecting both the rate at which
              these objects cool from birth and how they explode as supernovae if heated to
              high temperatures later in life by accreting material from a nearby companion
              star. Deep interior compositions may be probed by studying the properties of
              certain volumetric oscillations having periods of 100-1000 seconds. This
              project is a theoretical investigation of these non-radial oscillations and it
              addresses certain frontier questions. The most abundant atomic nucleus in the
              WD interior after carbon and oxygen is an isotope of neon that tends to sink
              towards the WD center. Interpreting observations of these objects requires the
              theoretical modeling of this project to understand how the oscillations and the
              cooling times are affected by the neon sedimentation and consequent composition
              gradient.  A second aspect of this project follows from the recent discovery of
              a pulsating WD in a mass transferring binary system. This finding has opened up
              a new field in astrophysics. Another set of theoretical calculations are
              required for such objects in this environment in order to convert observed
              pulsation periods that are comparable to the rotation periods of these stars
              into measurements of WD properties such as mass and the rotation rate.
