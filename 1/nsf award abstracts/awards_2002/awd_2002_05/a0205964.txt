This program will explore the very inner
              structure of active galactic nuclei, to determine masses of the central black
              holes using continuum and emission-line variability to probe the physical
              processes in the accretion-disk/broad-line region environment.   The current 
              program in progress to measure the bulge velocity dispersions in the host
              galaxies of active galactic nuclei will be expanded to test whether the
              relationship between the black-hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion is the
              same for active galaxies and quiescent galaxies.  This relationship will be
              used to estimate masses for local AGNs for which reverberation masses have not
              been measured, concentrating initially on radio-loud AGNs and narrow-line
              Seyfert 1 galaxies, objects that are not well represented in
              reverberation-mapped samples.  Optical ground-based support for multiwavelength
              monitoring programs will be provided, in particular a long-standing program of
              optical spectrophotometry on the well-studied Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548.
