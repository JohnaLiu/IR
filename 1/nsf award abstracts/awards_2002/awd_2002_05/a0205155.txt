Abstract    :
              Under this award, numerical tools will be developed for the
study of
              astrophysical systems involving relativistic
gravity, strong electromagnetic
              fields, and rotation.  These
tools will include computer codes for evolving
              fluids and
electromagnetic fields in a fixed gravitational field, codes
for
              evolving the relativistic gravitational field itself,
and a combined code that
              will evolve gravitational fields
with both material and electromagnetic
              sources.  Tools for
verifying the accuracy of the integrations will also
              be
developed.  The codes will be optimized for use on the
latest generation
              of supercomputers, publicly released, and
made available within the scientific
              community.  In the
course of developing these codes, computational
              scientists
will be trained at the undergraduate, graduate, and
postdoctoral
              levels.  The codes will also be applied by the
developers to problems at the
              forefront of astrophysics and
gravitation physics research.

This work is
              motivated by a number of astrophysical systems,
including: accreting black
              holes and neutron stars;
coalescing binary neutron stars and black holes;
              rapidly
rotating neutron stars formed in core-collapse supernovae;
and
              collapsing supermassive stars.  Taken together, these
objects are the focus of
              a large fraction of current
astrophysical research.  They are the likely
              source of
detectable gravitational waves, powerful X-ray emission,
              and
gamma-ray bursts.  So far, however, they have resisted
understanding
              because the underlying physics of the fluid,
the electromagnetic field, and
              the gravitational field is
complicated, nonlinear, and time dependent.  Only
              numerical
integrations can unlock the fundamental physics of black
hole
              accretion, test scenarios for the generation of
gamma-ray bursts, and generate
              more accurate predictions for
gravitational waveforms from coalescing compact
              binaries.
The required numerical methods do not yet exist; they will
be
              developed under this award.
