Hot stars, more massive than about eight solar
              masses, tend to have strong, high-speed outflows of gaseous material, which can
              result in the formation of wind-blown nebulae around these stars and also can
              produce effects on the interstellar medium. Recent observations, which have
              explored the nature of these nebulae with unprecedented resolution, have
              revealed a variety of aspherical morphologies, with bipolarity being a common
              theme. 

Using the theory of radiatively driven winds and numerical
              simulations, the formation and evolution of these circumstellar nebulae, and
              the origins of the bipolar structure, will be investigated.  These winds are
              modulated by physical processes such as stellar rotation, gravity darkening,
              bistability jumps, magnetic channeling of the outflow, and inhomogeneities in
              the stellar atmospheres. The effect of these processes, both individually and
              cumulatively, on the latitudinal variation of the winds, and thereby on the
              morphology of the surrounding nebulae, will be explored. Furthermore, the
              impact of this circumstellar medium on the subsequent evolution of the massive
              star as it ends its life in a supernova explosion will be investigated. The
              results will be compared to recent and archival data in the optical and X-ray
              regimes.
