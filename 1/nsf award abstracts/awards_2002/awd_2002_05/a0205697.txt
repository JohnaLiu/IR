Dr. Miller is awarded an NSF Astronomy and
              Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and
              education at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.  He will study
              black hole accretion for a wide range of black hole masses and accretion rates,
              searching for common geometries and underlying physics. He will study inner
              accretion flows of stellar-mass black holes and active galactic nuclei at many
              wavelengths, and will search for radio, optical, and UV counterparts to the
              newly-accessible class of black holes of intermediate mass and/or extremely
              high accretion rates.  In education, he will develop a  series of web-based
              video lectures on new and recent results in astronomy, whch may serve as a
              supplement to high school courses in earth science, physics, or astronomy.
