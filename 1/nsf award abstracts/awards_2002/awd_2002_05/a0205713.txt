Abstract    :
              The proposal requests funding for partial travel support for the
              Electron-Electron Interactions at TeV Energies Workshop at Santa Cruz in
              December 7-9, 2001. The funds will be used to support graduate students and
              postdoctoral fellows who might otherwise not be able to afford to attend the
              meeting.
