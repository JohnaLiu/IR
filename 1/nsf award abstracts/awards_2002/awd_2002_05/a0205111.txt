This grant
              will explore the automated construction of domain ontologies across
              governmental datasets. There are many "data silos" in government; that is,
              collections of data which cannot be cross-compared or queried. This is a major
              problem in presenting government information to consumers which is tailored
              according to their interests, rather than according to the organizational
              structure of government agencies. While such automated tools cannot completely
              construct accurate ontologies, they can take much of the labor intensiveness
              out of such efforts, particularly where the number of terms or variables is so
              large (in the thousands) as to prevent manual efforts. Working with the US
              Environmental Protection Agency, which has many datasets of interest to the
              public, the research team will develop a semi-automated toolkit to aid in the
              construction of ontologies.
