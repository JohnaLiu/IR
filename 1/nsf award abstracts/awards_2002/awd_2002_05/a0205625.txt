This project
              leverages research and development outcomes from prior NSF funding that focused
              on interactive mathematics education. The current project addresses three
              areas: 1) Research involving undergraduate education focused on investigating
              the training needed to produce practitioners capable of collaborative design of
              educational software, 2) Research into the processes used by collaborative
              software design teams, and 3) Research into K-12 educational impact because of
              the use of software produced by collaborative design teams. The project
              involves pre-college teachers and undergraduate and professional software
              developers in teams producing interactive software for K-12. In addition to
              primary goals of studying multidisciplinary collaborative teams and the impacts
              of the systems they develop on pre-college students, the project also looks at
              software re-use and collaborative tools needed for innovative applications of
              IT in education. Outcomes of this project will be insights into and
              understanding of: the kinds of course activities that are needed to enable
              effective teamwork between students with different backgrounds; course
              activities that will enable teams to discuss, share, and enact educational
              values in their software production process; the packaging of curricula into
              modules that are adaptable by a variety of institutions; the promotion of
              curricula that encourages enrollment by a broad spectrum of students in
              educational software development; and, the preparation of new teachers and
              developers for future work involving collaborative design. In addition, this
              project involves research into optimal design tools (the kinds of tools and
              resources such as design scenarios, national standards, bug lists, feature
              lists, and mailing lists that help teams achieve shared understanding),
              collaboration mechanisms and the design of tools and spaces to encourage a
              culture of reuse where team members borrow pedagogical ideas and technical
              modules from exemplary artifacts and in turn contribute useful products of
              their own, and a social network of human experts and coaches needed to produce
              educational software (i.e., best practices that can be identified for the ways
              experienced classroom teachers and software developers coach and support teams
              in developing good designs and encourage balanced participation by technical
              and non-technical team members). The overarching need that is addressed by the
              project is the shortage of standards-based, high-quality educational software
              for K-12 classrooms. The project aims to validate the premise that appropriate
              training and resources can enable a team to transform today's designs into
              improved designs that elicit and support higher-order mathematical thinking
              among the target K-12 students. Testing this hypothesis requires research in
              classroom impact including: exploring whether university student co-design
              teams can adapt and refine existing mathlet resources to produce new mathlets
              that engage higher-order mathematical thinking, identifying, refining, and
              disseminating to classrooms around the country the best mathlets from all
              participating institutions, expanding the adoption and utility of deployed
              mathlets be increased by enabling in-service teachers to configure the tools
              for their particular classroom needs. This project involves collaboration
              between several academic institutions, research organizations, and
              businesses.
