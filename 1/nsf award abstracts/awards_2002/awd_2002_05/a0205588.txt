Inadequate communication of domain knowledge in natural language (such
              as English textual descriptions) is a major source of requirements defects in
              high-confidence software.  Such defects can threaten lives, property, and the
              dependability of critical infrastructures.  This research develops innovative,
              multi-disciplinary techniques designed expressly to identify and cope with the
              properties of natural language that lead to these problems.  It analyses the
              domain-knowledge communication problem from the perspective 
of current
              linguistic theory in order to generate models and techniques that reduce
              communication breakdowns between domain experts and software developers.  On
              the basis of this analysis, techniques for the elicitation, recording, and
              propagation of domain knowledge in requirements activities will be designed.  
              A set of tools will also be developed to support the practical use of these
              engineering techniques.  Several case studies will be used to assess and refine
              the techniques and tools on actual, high-confidence software systems in the
              aviation and spacecraft application domains. The research effort is directed at
              the reduction of requirements defects through the application of techniques
              that take into account the linguistic difficulties particular to domain
              knowledge communication.
