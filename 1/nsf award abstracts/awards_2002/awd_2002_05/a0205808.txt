This is a program of diligent observation and analysis of
              supernova explosions. The goals
are to understand the mechanisms by which
              stars explode, to assess the supernova
contribution to the heavy element
              enrichment of the Universe, and to use supernova
explosions as tools for
              measuring the expansion history of the Universe. Many people have
embarked on
              finding supernovae, but these discoveries only lead to increased understanding
              when they are followed up. This group has been one of the most effective teams
              in the world at following supernovae -- in part because of the ideal
              instrumentation at Mount Hopkins .  In the coming years, the 6.5 meter MMT will
              become available along with the extraordinary opportunities at the two Magellan
              telescopes in the southern hemisphere. They are also refurbishing the 1.3 meter
              former 2MASS survey telescope at Mount Hopkins to augment the world's supply of
              infrared data. The group has made excellent progress in using Type Ia
              supernovae as accurate tools to measure extragalactic distances. This leads to
              a measurement of the expansion rate of the Universe, an estimate for the age of
              the Universe, demonstration of time dilation at high redshift, a way to detect
              large scale flows, and gives the only direct evidence for an accelerating
              Universe. Supernova observations have revealed that 2/3 of the Universe is dark
              energy, of an as-yet undetermined type, a finding with deep resonances with
              fundamental physics.
