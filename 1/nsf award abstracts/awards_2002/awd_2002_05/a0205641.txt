TITLE: Exploration and Control of Condensed Matter
              Qubits



The advent of new methods for controlling matter at nanometer
              length scales creates enormous opportunities for molecular and information
              processing.  Looking beyond the present problem of how to extend Moore's law
              within the existing computational paradigm, we can see that the ability to
              fabricate and control at increasingly small dimension brings with it the
              potential to generate entirely new technologies for processing of information. 
              This project explores the development of a new type of highly parallel
              processor that takes advantage of quantum degrees of freedom in solid state
              nanostructures to process information.   The main focus of the project is the
              basic science required for realization of truly scalable quantum logic devices.
               We address this task with experiments that explore the physics of several
              potential solid state realizations of quantum bit states, and also with
              theoretical investigations of decoherence, of robust control, and of efficient
              schemes for quantum logic that are tailored to the underlying quantum physics
              of specific implementations. This project is carried out by an
              interdisciplinary group of scientists and engineers, drawn from computer and
              engineering science, chemical physics, and solid state physics.  The broader
              impact of the work is to be disseminated together with educators and
              journalists in workshops and public lectures.
