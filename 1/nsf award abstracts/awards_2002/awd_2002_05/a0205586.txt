Abstract    :
              This proposal is concerned with developing of 3-D scanning methods to be applied
              to the imaging of cuneiform tablets. This process can make the tablets more
              readable by "deepening" the marks in tablets badly worn over centuries, thus
              sharpening the images.  The panel gave this proposal a Highly Competitive
              rating, noting that it was an excellent proposal with innovative work in
              information technology and the humanities and social sciences. For IT, the
              impact is the development of a portable, very high resolution surface scanner
              and the multi-resolution algorithms. For the humanities, the project represents
              significant work with a potentially very wide application to other other
              objects with the result of opening up new fields of study to a larger group of
              scholars. The technology and techniques developed can be imported to other
              areas of study of ancient cultures and languages.
