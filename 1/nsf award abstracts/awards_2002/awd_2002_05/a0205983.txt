After decades of progress, many stages of stellar
              evolution remain only modestly understood.  The investigators here will exploit
              a powerful tool that Nature provides for probing the interiors of stars, namely
              asteroseismology. At several points in their evolution, stars undergo
              self-excited nonradial pulsations, which are observable as multiperiodic
              brightness variations. By observing these variations as continuously as
              possible for as long as is practical, they resolve the multiple frequencies of
              variation in these stars. Since each frequency represents a normal-mode of
              oscillation of the star, by consulting theoretical models they will deduce
              details of the global and internal structure of these stars with striking
              detail. Among other things, using asteroseismology they will measure the mass
              of isolated pulsators to great accuracy, determine where there are structural
              or compositional changes in the interior of pulsators, and place limits on or
              actually measure the chemical composition of a pulsator as a function of
              radius.   The success in this project results from the operation of a unique
              instrument known as the Whole Earth Telescope (WET). The WET is an
              international partnership of astronomers, distributed around the Earth, who
              gather continuous time-series brightness measurements of rapidly varying stars
              and analyze these data to extract the astrophysical insight contained therein.
