This award supports Dr. Kevin Griffin of Columbia University
              for a three-year collaborative research project with Dr. David Whitehead of
              Landcare Research Institute and Dr. Matthew Turnbull of the University of
              Canterbury, both in New Zealand.  The research will assess the contribution of
              woody tissue respiration to the carbon balance in a forest ecosystem. 
              Objectives include 1) making continuous real time measurements of respiration
              from stems, branches and roots for periods of days to weeks under field
              conditions, 2) determining the processes influencing wood respiration by
              monitoring responses to natural environmental variability in different forested
              ecosystems, and 3) quantitatively describing these responses for use in a model
              to estimate ecosystem carbon balance.  

Understanding the processes that
              regulate the carbon balance of forest ecosystems is a critical issue in
              predicting how forests will impact the atmospheric carbon dioxide balance in
              the future.  This collaboration brings together the efforts of international
              laboratories that have complementary expertise and research facilities.  The
              project will also enhance the international research competence of the American
              graduate student who will participate in the research in New Zealand.
