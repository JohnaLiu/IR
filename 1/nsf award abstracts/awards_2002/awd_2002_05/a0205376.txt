Abstract    :
              Securing our nation's computing and networking infrastructure against damage due
              to malicious attacks or spontaneous faults is a problem of paramount
              importance.  This project aims to contribute to this mission
by developing
              novel techniques and tools based on model checking and program analysis for
              vulnerability analysis: the problem of identifying and monitoring weaknesses in
              computer systems that can be exploited to compromise system security. A major
              expected outcome of the project is a set of tools for determining the
              consistency and safety of computer system configurationss, such as those
              specified by firewall rules
and domain type rules.
