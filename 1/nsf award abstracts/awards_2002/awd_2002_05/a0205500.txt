There has been significant progress in recent years
              in our understanding of the physics of the Sun.  In particular the structure of
              the sun is being revealed from detailed observations of the solar surface
              layers and their motions.  In a sense the Sun is a giant echo chamber and
              careful analysis of all the solar resonant modes and wave propagation
              properties tells us what the interior is like.  In this research realistic
              numerical simulations of the interaction between convection in the outer solar
              layers, magnetic fields, and the acoustic oscillations will be carried out to
              aid our understanding of the solar interior.  The project will extend our
              knowledge by studying small scale magnetic fields produced 'locally' and their
              role in the formation of supergranulation at the solar surface.  The results
              will be applied to present solar observations and will provide guidance to the
              design of the next generation of high spatial and temporal resolution solar
              telescopes.
