The past five years have seen the
              identification of a large number of sub-stellar objects in the solar
              neighborhood and in star-forming regions. Indeed, it appears that brown dwarfs
              may
be as common as stars. However, there are few observational constraints on
              their origin and early evolution. Studies of young brown dwarfs provide
              valuable clues to their formation
mechanism(s). This program explores the
              physical properties of brown dwarfs in star-forming regions and compare them to
              the much better studied pre-main sequence stars, in order to shed light on
              their origin. The program employs many of the methods developed in the study of
              T Tauri stars, and includes (1) a search for thermal infrared emission from
              disks around young sub-stellar objects, (2) optical spectroscopy to derive
              their accretion luminosities and mass accretion rates, (3) modeling of
              scattered light and thermal emission of disks, (4) observations of X-ray
              emission, as an indicator of activity, and (5) measurements of rotation periods
              based on photometric variability in the optical.  The results of this program
              will help distinguish among different formation scenarios for brown dwarfs,
              such as cloud fragmentation, protostellar disk instability, and ejection from
              newborn multiple systems, whether young sub-stellar objects undergo a T
              Tauri-like phase.
