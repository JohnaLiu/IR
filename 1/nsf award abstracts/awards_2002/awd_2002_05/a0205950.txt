Abstract    :
                   The grant provides partial support for a 3-day workshop on real-time
              logistics with 40-50 participants meeting in Marina Del Rey, California, April
              26-28, 2002. The idea is to address the opportunities and research challenges
              posed by the recent emergence of practical and economic GPS and other real time
              information sources about the status of pick-up and delivery trucking.
              Real-time communication is revolutionizing the logistics world by making
              practical a host of new information and control possibilities.  Several
              research presentations will be provided, along with breakout sessions to
              discuss research priorities.  The workshop would be jointly hosted by the
              University of Southern California and the University of Arizona, and funded by
              Department of Transportation sources in addition to the NSF and the
              universities.
