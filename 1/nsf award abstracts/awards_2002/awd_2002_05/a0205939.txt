Abstract    :
              The project of Professor James Haw of the University of Southern California,
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, seeks to achieve a
              fundamental understanding of the catalytic reactions that occur on zeolites and
              solid acid catalysts.  A special pulse quench catalytic reactor has been
              designed that allows the investigation of catalytic reactions by nuclear
              magnetic resonance spectrometry.  Changes in chemical intermediates can be
              followed with this device with a time resolution of 0.2 s; reactions are
              quenched by rapid cooling or by the introduction of inhibiting reagents. 
              Theoretical calculations are also used to model the experimental NMR results
              via calculated NMR chemical shifts and quadrupolar coupling constants.  Two
              specific examples of catalytic systems to be studied in this project include
              the synthesis of pyridine and butene isomerization, both are processes which
              are catalyzed by zeolites.  

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry is used
              to study the catalytic transformation of simple adsorbed gases into more
              complex molecules on zeolites and solid acids.   Professor James Haw at the
              University of Southern California has developed a combination of chemical
              reaction system with quenching that allows complex catalytic systems to be
              studied.  The new analytical method will be used to study the industrially
              important projects of pyridine synthesis and the isomerization of butene, a
              precursor to synthetic rubber.
