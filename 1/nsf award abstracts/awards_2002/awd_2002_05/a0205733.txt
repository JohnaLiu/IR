Abstract    :
              One of the difficulties facing computer security systems is getting users and
              administrators to adopt them.  The project studies a new approach to deploying
              security services called Deployment-Oriented
Security.  The first question is
              how to deploy security services in a viral-like fashion.  The idea is that once
              a small set of users adopt a security system, they gradually get their friends
              to adopt the
system and as a result the service propagates through the
              population.  The project studies how this meme-like strategy applies to various
              security services such as secure e-mail, anonymity mechanisms,
electronic
              voting, secure file systems, e-cash, etc.  Another approach to promoting the
              deployment of security systems is to deploy the required infrastructure on the
              fly.  For example, can one deploy an
anonymizing server or a fair-exchange
              service on the fly to enable that service?  How does one identify trusted hosts
              to deploy the service and how does one revoke corrupt or misbehaving hosts? 
              The
third topic studied in this project is how to deploy protection mechanisms
              in environments where information is being shared.  The project will use new
              cryptographic tools to develop efficient key 
management techniques for
              broadcast data.
