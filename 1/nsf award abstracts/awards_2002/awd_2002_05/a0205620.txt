Abstract    :
              This project is a multidisciplinary, international collaborative research
              project aimed at developing a theoretical understanding of the records
              generated by the scientific, government and artistic sections. On this basis,
              the project will formulate and test various technology, metadata, and policy
              models, etc. to ensure that records created using these systems can be trusted
              as to content reliability and accuracy and for subsequent multipurpose use. The
              project will address issues related to how information technology is
              transforming functions of modern society, particularly in the areas of digital
              government, e-commerce and large-scale research efforts.
