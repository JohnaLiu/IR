Abstract    :
              When humans interact with each other and their environment, there are breakdowns
              that naturally result due to the mismatch in their understanding of the current
              situation. This is often exacerbated by computers because they only have a
              minimal understanding of human dialogue and interaction. The breakdowns can be
              smoothed out by making computers more aware of the physical and social contexts
              they are a part of. This project seeks to investigate user-centered methods and
              technologies to assist designers and developers in the design, prototyping, and
              evaluation of real-world context-aware applications, focusing on issues that
              have yet to be addressed, including usability, privacy, and scalability. This
              work focuses on (1) exploring new user-centered methods and tools for
              designing, prototyping, and evaluating context-aware applications, (2)
              understanding the nature of privacy concerns with respect to context-aware
              systems and developing mechanisms for addressing these concerns, and (3)
              providing an infrastructure to help programmers to build these applications for
              a large number of users and sensors. This work will be evaluated by developing
              two socially relevant applications: (1) emergency response support for
              coordinating, communicating, and allocating resources, and (2) an augmented
              wheelchair providing word prediction for individuals with motor impairments
