There is something magic about the beginnings of
              centuries: The beginning of the 21st century promises to become a real golden
              age for cosmology.  Only twenty years ago cosmology was a semi-qualitative,
              highly theoretical collection of general ideas about the possible past and
              future of the universe.  Today, cosmology is rapidly turning into a precision
              science, informed by a new generation of large, high quality, cosmological
              surveys carried out by observatories both in space and on the ground. The
              current task is to understand data already available, and to prepare the tools
              for precision analysis of forthcoming data.  In this project Dr. Gnedin and his
              collaborators will develop techniques to model the distribution of galaxies
              using recent and future large-scale surveys.  Current surveys have already
              compiled catalogs of three-dimensional positions of about 100,000 galaxies, and
              in the next several years this number will increase ten-fold.  To mine these
              surveys for the cosmological information locked inside them,  this project will
              use state-of-the-art numerical simulations to model the distribution of matter
              in the Universe.
