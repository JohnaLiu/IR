This program will develop new understanding of
              the nature of very-luminous dust-enshrouded high redshift galaxies recently
              discovered in the submillimeter waveband.  These luminous distant 'SMGs '
              generate a significant fraction of the energy emitted by all galaxies over the
              early history of the Universe, and yet are still poorly understood. This is
              largely because the angular resolution of even the most powerful
              submillimeter-wave survey telescopes is not sufficient to pin down the
              positions of SMGs with sufficient accuracy to confirm a single galaxy as their
              counterpart in an optical image.  This program will determine accurate
              positions for the counterparts, and then determine their redshifts and
              astrophysical properties.  Measuring the redshift distribution for the SMGs is
              a particularly important goal.  This is the most important piece of information
              required to determine the evolution of the population of SMGs, and their
              relationship with the larger and better understood samples of high-redshift
              galaxies detected in optical galaxy surveys.
