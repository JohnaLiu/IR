Abstract    :
              Parallel machines with over a hundred thousand processors are now being built.
              NSF's widely accessible TeraScale facilities have already deployed a 3,000
              processor machine. Algorithmic advances have made it possible to solve problems
              at a much faster rate. However, complexity of these algorithms and
              parallelizing them remain a hindrance to advances in scientific computing. This
              project will develop an object based methodology to simplify development of
              highly efficient parallel applications.   A run-time system will be developed
              to automatically distribute the user's object based application among various
              processors. This novel system observes the running program to apply dynamically
              an intelligent suite of strategies to effect optimization. Parallel components
              can be plugged in and out of running computations and exchange data with each
              other in a flexible manner. 
The development of this infrastructure will
              provide a framework to allow easy building of particle-oriented parallel
              programs to be used to model galaxies, dark matter, stars, planets, and gas
              particles in computational astrophysics. The new framework will allow
              simulations to operate efficiently with billions of particles and tens of
              thousands of processors. These simulations will be able to make direct contact
              with satellite and ground-based astronomical data to obtain cosmological
              parameters with high precision and to study how planets form.
