ITR: Language,
              Learning, and Modeling Biological Sequences

Recent significant advances in
              natural language processing such as the integration of grammatical and
              probabilistic machine-learning techniques have not been exploited for modeling
              biological sequences. These new techniques are highly relevant to the
              biological domain because they support the integration of sequence features at
              several scales, from dependencies between successive items through dependencies
              involving complex structures to overall sequence statistics. Hence, the major
              goals to be pursued are: (1)  Development of new techniques for integrating
              grammatical and probabilistic information, in particular, integration and
              evaluation of grammatical, probabilistic, and approximate counting methods for
              fold prediction in secondary and tertiary structures of biomolecules. (2)
              Development and evaluation of probabilistic exponential models for gene
              finding, in particular genes for apicoplast-targeted proteins in eukaryotic
              human pathogens of the phylum `Apicomplexa'. 

This research is highly
              interdisciplinary, involving the disciplines of computer science, biology and
              linguistics. It will have a significant impact on the modeling of biological
              sequences. It will also provide a wonderful opportunity to train new
              researchers to carry out this interdisciplinary research, thus contributing to
              science and mathematical education and human resource development. 

The
              proposed research arose out of many discussions that took place at a landmark
              workshop on `Language Modeling of Biological Data' held at the University of
              Pennsylvania in February 2001.
