Stars such as the Sun lie in galaxies that are
              collections of billions of stars, separated from other galaxies by vast
              distances. These galaxies can take many forms, from flat, spinning disks like
              our own Milky Way, to giant nearly spherical galaxies that lie at the center of
              galaxy clusters. We would like to know how these shapes arise, and where the
              spins came from. We know that galaxies probably formed from the gravitational
              collapse of clouds of gas in the early Universe.  In principle, the patterns of
              galaxy shapes and spins that we see nowadays has preserved information about
              what happened at the very beginning. Enormous new surveys of millions of
              galaxies that are being carried out today will enable us to measure these
              patterns very precisely.

This project will use computer models of galaxy
              formation to explore how the conditions at these very early times dictated what
              we see in the Universe around us today. In particular, it seeks to investigate
              how galaxies form, how they get their shapes and why they spin. It will also
              examine whether these calculations show correlations between  the shapes and
              spins of neighboring galaxies. The possibility that galaxy shapes and spins are
              correlated has important implications for other projects that try to measure
              the bending of light by the gravitational fields of these galaxies (known as
              gravitational lensing).
