Title: 
              ITR:  The Community Information Technology Entrepreneurship Project

Loyola
              University has been awarded an ITR grant to educate students and contribute to
              the economic development of impoverished communities by means of collaborative
              projects with small community businesses and not-for-profit organizations in
              Chicago and surrounding areas that are heavily populated with groups that are
              under-represented in science and technology.  The project will build a
              technology outreach program that brings together in a mentoring relationship,
              faculty, students and community members to create an IT entrepreneurship
              program which focuses on business software development

Two academic goals of
              the project are to enhance the computer science education and experience of
              university students, and instill a sense of civic engagement in students and
              faculty.  The research design will use data gathering and analysis techniques
              to measure outcomes related to these and other goals.  The benefits to Loyola
              students will include hands-on experience in helping to develop real world
              software applications, as well as an understanding of the poor communities. 
              The benefits to the Austin community include the learning of IT skills, a sense
              of entrepreneurship in IT and improvement in their environment coupled with
              financial gains.
