Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a group at Bucknell University for a program
              of research and education in experimental elementary particle physics based on
              the MiniBooNE experiment at Fermilab.  The experiment involves an investigation
              of the KARMEN timing anomaly and a search for neutral heavy leptons, sterile
              neutrinos and neutral supersymmetric and axion-like particles. The KARMEN
              anomaly is an excess of neutrino events detected in the KARMEN experiment at
              the ISIS spallation neutron facility at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and may
              be due to a rare non-Standard Model p+ decay mode: m+Q0 where Q0 denotes a
              massive, neutral, weakly interacting unstable particle. The study of the
              anomaly requires a comprehensive investigation of possible background
              contributions, the main component of the proposed work of the Bucknell group.
              The work will be performed in collaboration with a group of undergraduates.
