Abstract    :
              The University Materials Council (UMC), an organization of department chairs of
              materials science and engineering programs, and the Federation of Materials
              Societies (FMS), a network of materials-related professional societies, are
              co-organizing a meeting on materials education entitled in Materials Education:
              Opportunities over a Lifetime. This meeting will involve a thorough interchange
              of beneficial ideas and practices in materials science and engineering
              education among concerned citizens, professional educators, and
              "funders"/policy makers at three levels: grassroots, K-12, and
              college/university. The goals are for all groups involved in materials
              education to learn about the possibilities for parallel activities and
              collaboration. Professional educators will become aware of the broad spectrum
              of potential sources of support. Funding organizations and policy makers will
              become acquainted with the needs, opportunities, and activities in materials
              education.

This one and one-half day forum will take place at the University
              of Maryland- College Park on May 20-21, 2002, with a registration fee that will
              cover all meals and will feature a presentation by a concerned member of
              Congress. The meeting is a continuation of the series of FMS Biennial Meetings.
              Outside sponsorship is requested in order to allow participation by a wide and
              varied group of individuals interested in materials education.
