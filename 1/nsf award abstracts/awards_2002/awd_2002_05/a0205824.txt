Abstract    :
              


This project involves research on new instructional technologies, for use
              in teaching astronomy to non-science majors. The central goal is to involve
              students in research-level astronomy data sets, so that they can understand the
              process of science by active exploration. Other goals are to use models and
              simulation to convey complex or abstract concepts, and to allow students to
              explore multimedia astronomy content in flexible ways. The major areas of focus
              for content development are (1) interactive Java applets that use real data to
              teach basic physics and astronomy concepts, (2) virtual worlds that allow a 3D
              exploration of the universe on various scales, (3) a natural language "expert
              system" to answer questions across the subject matter, with associated testing
              materials, and (4) a data architecture to allow the flexible delivery of this
              content over the Internet, via voice portals, and to a variety of devices on
              the wireless web. The overall goal is a rich learning environment that measures
              performance and can adapt to different student interests and learning styles.
              The tools developed in this project have an immediate application for distance
              learning, and the technologies and modes of delivery can readily be applied
              across other science subjects.
