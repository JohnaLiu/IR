Abstract    :
              The proposed research is in the area of geometry and
dynamics. The objective is
              to understand the asymptotic behavior
of orbits of dynamical systems. One
              specific problem deals with
surface laminations in hyperbolic three-manifolds.
              Rather than
studying recurrence phenomena taking place in a compact space
              a
global approach is taken. The geometry of hyperbolic space has a
well
              defined visual boundary representing the many possible ways
of diverging to
              infinity. Moreover, the ambient hyperbolic
geometry affects the geometry of
              the leaves of the lamination
under consideration. The basic problem is then to
              study how these
geometries relate with respect to their approach to the
              visual
boundaries, and to examine the influence that the ambient
hyperbolic
              geometry exerts on the leaves.  Within this program it
is also natural to
              consider laminations whose leaves have
stronger geometric or analytic
              properties, or both, as for
example when they satisfy the minimal surface
              differential
equation. Such hypothesis allows for the use of analytical
              and
probabilistic tools, and more precise information can be
obtained.
              Laminations whose leaves are minimal surfaces are also
relevant to understand
              the geometry of other three-manifolds as
well. They appear to play an
              important role in the topological
hyperbolization conjecture for
              three-manifolds, as is known that
non-hyperbolic three manifolds have a
              lamination by minimal
surfaces.  This proposal also includes problems in the
              area of
rigidity of actions of semisimple groups. The main focus is in
the
              so-called Gromov's centralizer theorem, a major tool in
understanding the
              symmetries of geometric structures on
manifolds. Other questions relating to
              the structure of
pseudogroups of transformations are also
              proposed.

Dynamical systems are used to model processes in many areas,
              for
example the weather, physical or chemical processes, and the
evolution of
              living organisms and their morphology. They are also
used for modeling
              processes which evolve from a finite amount of
data according to some set of
              rules, either specified before hand
or of a random nature, as neural networks
              in the brain or systems
of digital processors in a computer. The objective of
              the
proposed research is to understand the qualitative structure
              and
asymptotic behavior of certain dynamical systems. One of the
topics in
              this proposal is to study the behavior of
two-dimensional systems evolving in
              a three-dimensional space,
and specifically the interaction of the features of
              the
surrounding space and the geometry and asymptotic behavior of
their
              trajectories. This can be approached in a variety of ways:
by purely geometric
              means, by studying certain differential
equations that define their orbits, or
              via a probabilistic
approach. Understanding basic features of these dynamical
              systems
and these spaces, while having intrinsic geometric interest
              and
beauty, could be relevant, for example, in areas like
              partial
differential equations, solid state physics, structure of
crystals
              and quasi-crystals and their defects, statistical
mechanics, computation and
              algorithms.
