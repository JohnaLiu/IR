Abstract    :
              
This proposal is to host a workshop bringing together animal behavior and
              information technology experts to design an on-line computer database of
              behavioral information. The database might include, for example, videotaped
              images or audio-recordings of animals engaged in various types of behavior,
              measurements of the frequencies and contexts with which different sorts of
              behavior are produced, and useful techniques for collecting behavioral data
              from different species. It would also include software tools to link and
              extract information from existing databases, as well as to visualize and
              analyze the behavioral data effectively. The resulting database will help
              animal behavior researchers share their data with each other (n a search for
              general patterns), with researchers in other fields (e.g., genomics,
              neurobiology, ecology), and with the general public who are often fascinated by
              animal behavior. Funds will be used to host the workshop (travel expenses), to
              produce a prototype version of the database, and to share this prototype
              database with other behavioral researchers.
