Abstract    :
              Quantitative parameters for short-term (24-48 hours) forecasts of solar activity
              will be computed from high-resolution vector magnetographs obtained at the Big
              Bear and Huairou solar observatories. These parameters include the power-law
              index b of the longitudinal magnetic field structure functions (i.e., two-point
              correlation functions), and the cancellation exponent k of the electric-current
              helicity. Data from a four-station global Ha network will be used to identify
              solar flares for comparison analyses with changes in active region magnetic
              fields. Extrapolation of the observed photospheric magnetic fields will permit
              inferences of the field orientation in active region filaments, which in turn
              may be used to forecast filament eruptions and their geoeffectiveness.
