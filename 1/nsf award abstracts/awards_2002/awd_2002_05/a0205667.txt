Abstract    :
              A highly dependable information infrastructure requires systems that are
              massively replicated, slow to fail, and resistant to attack. The LOCKSS system
              uses novel techniques for increasing dependability that show promise of wider
              applicability and increasing importance in this area, including:

Building a
              fault-tolerant system from a large number of replicas that take part in
              "opinion polls" rather than a small number of replicas that take part in
              elections.

Limiting the speed at which the system operates in order to limit
              the speed at which it can fail.

Building a system that resists the
              activities of the "bad guy" without requiring that secrets be kept, in part by
              using public communication and a reputation system.

Experience with this and
              other peer-to-peer systems shows that the real challenges of making systems
              work only become apparent at a realistic operational scale and running on real
              networks. The LOCKSS system is now running on the Internet with 60 peers
              worldwide. The project will exploit this LOCKSS test-bed to investigate areas
              in which further work is needed.
