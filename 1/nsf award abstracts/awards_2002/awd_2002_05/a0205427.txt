This is a program for measuring the masses of
              pre-main-sequence stars using millimeter wavelength interferometry.   Accurate
              measurements of stellar masses are crucial data, and this work will provide
              answers to some fundamental astrophysical questions. In particular, it will
              provide observational constraints on two areas of astrophysical theory that are
              currently relatively poorly constrained: pre-main-sequence evolutionary tracks,
              and theories of binary star formation. The PI will also continue his program of
              the detection of faint secondary companions in single-lined spectroscopic
              binaries, both to measure the mass ratio distribution of binaries and to
              provide additional data to use for measuring masses when combined with resolved
              observations of binary star orbits.
