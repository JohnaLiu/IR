Dr.  Christopher  Magri, at the University of Maine, will
              use  the  upgraded  radar  system  at  the  Arecibo Observatory  to  study 
              carbonaceous  main-belt  asteroids  (MBAs).    He  will  use  radar-derived
              constraints on target shape, topography, rotation state, composition, and
              near-surface roughness to define similarities and differences between the
              various taxonomic classes containing dark objects and between carbonaceous MBAs
              and other asteroids.  This project, a continuation of NSF-supported  research 
              carried  out  since  1999,  is  a  logical  outgrowth  of  Dr.  Magri's 
              recent
statistical analyses of MBAs detected prior to the facility upgrade.
              Carbonaceous asteroids are thought to be relatively unaltered from the
              primordial solids which  condensed  in  the  outer  solar  nebula;  the 
              outermost  ones  probably  have  complex  organic molecules on their surfaces. 
              This is the first time that large numbers of such objects have been detectable
              by radar.  Hence, Dr. Magri's work represents a step toward understanding the
              origin and evolution of our solar system.
