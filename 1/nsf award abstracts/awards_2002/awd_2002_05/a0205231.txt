Umashankar & Choi

This is a planning visit grant for Drs. Ray
              Umashankar and Christopher Choi, in the College of Engineering at the
              University of Arizona, to travel to Namibia to meet with Professor Ibo
              Zimmerman and his colleagues in the Department of Natural Resources with the
              Polytechnic of Namibia, to explore the feasibility of developing a US-Namibia
              REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) Site in the area of Controlled
              Environment Agriculture (CEA) with Web-cam and CAD applications.  CEA is the
              production of plants and their products within structures, such as greenhouses,
              that are engineered to control the environments of the plants.  Structures are
              monitored by Web-cams and Web-based control systems.  Student projects would
              focus on the mechanatronics and hydrophonics areas.

This project is being
              jointly funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the
              Division of Engineering Education and Centers.
