TITLE: Collaborative Research:
              ITR: Acquiring Accurate Dynamic Field Data Using Lightweight
              Instrumentation

Dynamic analyses, such as testing and profiling, play a key
              role in state-of-art approaches to software quality assurance (QA).  With rare
              exception, these analyses are performed in-house, on developer
platforms,
              using developer-provided input workloads. Shortcomings of this approach include
              that the results simply cannot be  rusted to tell us how the software actually
              performs in the field.

The project goal is to give developers unprecedented
              insight into the actual runtime behavior of their software, allowing developers
              (and ultimately the software itself) to change, optimize, and adapt the
              software based on highly accurate field data. Lightweight, collaborative
              dynamic analyses conducted around-the-world and around-the-clock form the new
              platform: (1) lightly instrument fielded software (i.e., each program copy
              performs a small part of the analysis) (2) collect the partial data from many
              instances of the software, fusing it to conduct the complete analysis, (3)
              change the running program instances based on the findings and (4) repeat the
              process.

Seven critical research challenges form the core of the project:
              
1. Lightweight instrumentation--Develop instrumentation that is  virtually
              transparent to individual users. 2. Compositional analysis techniques--Develop
              distributed analysis techniques that decompose
traditional analyses into
              smaller steps, distribute the steps among multiple users, and then fuse each
              user's results into an accurate solution to the original problem.  3.
              Scalability--Develop storage and analysis techniques to deal with the high data
              volumes we expect to encounter. 4. Anomaly Detection--Define data-driven
              techniques to automatically identify anomalous behaviors of deployed software.
              5. Privacy and Security--Incorporate privacy and security safeguards into our
              data collection and analysis approaches. 
6. Dynamic updating
              mechanisms--Develop techniques to make runtime changes to the location and
              function of instrumentation, and to parts of the software itself. 7. Validate
              approach on industrial software.
