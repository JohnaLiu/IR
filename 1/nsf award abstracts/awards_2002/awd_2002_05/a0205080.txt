One of the outstanding questions in
              extra-galactic astronomy and cosmology pertains to the search for the missing
              matter in the universe. Dark matter lies hidden in the largest galaxies and
              clusters of galaxies, and until the advent of gravitational lensing, there was
              no way to probe the outer reaches of these objects.  Weak lensing analysis has
              proven a boon to modern astrophysics in that it allows for an accurate
              measurement of cluster masses without recourse to assumptions about the
              dynamical state of the system, its composition, or its 3-dimensional geometry. 
              Lensing introduces an elliptical distortion to galaxies behind clusters. The
              mean ellipticity determined from many background galaxies may then be used to
              reconstruct the cluster's gravitational potential, and thus its mass
              distribution. This analysis has already been successfully applied to a number
              of galaxies, clusters, and to large-scale structure generally.  In previous
              work, the awardee has expanded existing lensing analysis to second-order, thus
              describing a transition regime in which lensing is too weak to produce dramatic
              arcs, but for which an arc-like signal can still be detected.  The present
              project will expand upon this previous work. These techniques, if successfully
              demonstrated, can be applied to a number of existing and publicly available
              datasets.  The award is for seed funding for a proof of concept of  advanced
              lensing analysis.
