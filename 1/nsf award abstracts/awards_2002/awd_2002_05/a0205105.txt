Jets of gas, flowing at close to the speed of light, are
              a common feature of our Universe and are found wherever compact objects such as
              black holes capture material. In this project, computer simulations of these
              jets will be used to advance our understanding of such energetic flows. In
              particular these simulations will be designed to help us understand how such
              jets can penetrate their environment without disruption and also shed light on
              the nature of the `engines'  which produce them. 

The technique used in this
              study incorporates Special Relativity and uses state-of-the-art methods
              originally designed for fields such as aerospace engineering. It enables large
              computations to be performed with modest computer resources, thus allowing an
              exploration of many facets of the problem. Among these are: how shock waves
              form in the gas flow, and how the flow responds to impacting dense surrounding
              material, or being spun around in space due to changes in the direction of the
              engine's nozzle. An important aspect of the study is that it provides a probe
              of the poorly understood jets of stellar binary systems, and should reveal the
              extent to which these really are mini-quasars -- scaled down versions of active
              galaxies. The same technique is applied to the nebulae that result from pulsar
              winds, where moving through the ambient medium causes the nebula to be swept
              back into a tail of gas, similar to the galactic and stellar jets.
              Understanding these `wind nebulae' will provide insight into the flow from the
              pulsar itself, which is not directly observable.
