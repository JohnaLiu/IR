This is a research project to discover and
              characterize very low-luminosity substellar objects. The search will take place
              in several nearby young stellar associations and open clusters with ages
              ranging from 1 to 120~Myr, and in high galactic latitude fields. Brown dwarf
              and free-floating planet candidates will be identified using deep multi-color
              CCD photometry. Near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy will provide crucial
              information on the nature of the objects. These observations will increase
              significantly the sample of known brown dwarfs. Hence, this new field of
              research will be put on a more firm statistical basis. The relative numbers of
              brown dwarfs and free planets in a given association, cluster and the field
              will allow the determination of luminosity functions and mass functions in the
              substellar regime for a variety of environmental conditions. Follow-up studies,
              such as disk accretion for very low-mass primaries, binarity, rotation, and
              weather-like variability will be carried out by Martin and others.
