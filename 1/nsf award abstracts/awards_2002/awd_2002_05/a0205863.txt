Unraveling the fundamental relationships between
              asteroids, comets, and meteorites is a
first step toward important new
              insights into the early history of our own planetary system. Observational
              investigation of the near-Earth object (NEO) population provides the unique
              opportunity for studying all three of these classes of objects. The long-term
              interests of society also dictate that we achieve an understanding of the NEO
              population for assessing NEOs for their impact hazard and space resource
              potential.

Dr. Richard Binzel, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
              will direct  an observational program to measure the near infrared spectral
              properties for 40-60 NEOs per year, substantially increasing the quantity and
              quality of these types of observations of Earth's nearest neighbors. The
              near-infrared measurements will be made over the wavelength range 0.8-2.5Mm
              using the new state-of-the-art SpeX spectrograph at the Infrared Telescope
              Facility (IRTF) at Mauna Kea, Hawaii.  The principal goal of the project is
              basic reconnaissance of the near-infrared spectral characteristics of the NEO
              population. The observations and data set will be a balance between
              measurements that push to the state-of-the-art limits of the technology for the
              smallest and faintest objects and measurements that provide high
              signal-to-noise-ratio spectra sufficient for detailed mineralogical analysis.
