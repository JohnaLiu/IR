Under this Investigator Initiated Award, studies will be
              preformed to develop an ultrawideband microwave imaging method for detection,
              monitoring and noninvasive treatment of early-stage breast cancer.  The
              intrinsic dielectric-properties contrast between malignant and normal breast
              tissue provides the basis for highly sensitive detection of malignant lesions
              using microwaves.  The objectives are to:  1) develop robust space-time signal
              processing algorithms that exploit the dielectric-properties contrast for the
              detection and monitoring of malignant lesions, 2) develop space-time
              signal-processing algorithms for non-invasive microwave hyperthermia treatment
              of malignant breast lesions, 3) investigate the performance of the approach for
              early-stage cancer detection, monitoring, and treatment using anatomically
              realistic numerical breast models, 4) develop realistic physical breast
              phantoms and pre-clinical hardware prototype instrumentation, and 5)
              investigate the performance of the approach for breast cancer detection using
              the pre-clinical instrument in both synthetic breast phantom and ex vivo breast
              tissue imaging experiments.  The proposed approach offers the potential of a
              easy-to-use, low cost, comfortable, non-ionizing breast screening technology
              capable of reducing the rate of false negatives and false positives associated
              with conventional X-ray mammography.  The treatment protocol will minimize the
              complications, discomfort, and need for invasive procedures for women with
              breast cancer.
