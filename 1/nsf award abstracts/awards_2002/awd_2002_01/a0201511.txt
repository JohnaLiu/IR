Abstract    :
              This project, submitted under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
              program, will study the effect of the recent terrorist events and subsequent
              American actions on the nature and structure of trust in political and social
              institutions in the United States.  The researchers are undertaking a two-wave
              national panel survey designed to capture the effects of information on the
              levels of various forms of trust and the relationships among these forms of
              trust.  The research offers the unique opportunity to study public trust in the
              aftermath of the terrorist attacks and assess the effect of a national crisis
              on the dynamics of trust. 

These data will be of value to scholars
              interested in the topic and also to decision-makers trying to differentiate
              between various forms of trust and how it rises or falls as new information
              becomes available to the public.  The researchers will be able to gauge how
              public trust changes over time based on the actions taken by the U.S.
              government in tandem with changes in the perceived threat.
