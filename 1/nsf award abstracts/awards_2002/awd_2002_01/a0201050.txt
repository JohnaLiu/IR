Abstract    :
              The research program examines novel procedures of spectral estimation related to
              the processing of seismic data.  Wavelet analysis is employed to describe the
              time-dependent characteristics and localized events present in earthquake
              records.  The wavelet transform is increasingly being used in a variety of
              applications.

Various wavelets families are examined for use in seismic
              spectrum estimation problems.  The suitability of the various methods for
              estimating the cross spectra of two accelerograms is investigated, and the
              spatial variability of seismic records examined.  The method developed will be
              applied in processing a small but representative number of records from
              important earthquakes, such as the Kocaeli seismic event in Turkey, and the
              Northridge seismic event in California.  The evolutionary spectral content of
              seismic records, obtained via the wavelet method, has potential application to
              the safety of critical constructed facilities.
