Abstract    :
              0201943   O'Day  The proposed project will examine the mobilization of arsenic
              from sediments where it occurs in association with iron oxyhydroxides.  The
              project will focus on a specific study site, North Haiwee Reservior near
              Olancha, California, where the input of arsenic to the sediments is controlled
              by engineering practices of known duration and magnitude and which has been the
              subject of a preliminary study by the research group.  The project focuses on a
              specific field site because of the unique opportunities that site offers.  It
              is anticipated that the mechanisms of iron and arsenic mobilization at Haiwee
              will be relevant to a variety of iron-dominated systems including aquifer
              sediments.  Further, the information that is obtained on the timescales for
              arsenic release from sediments and the factors governing these timescales will
              increase understanding of the kinetic controls on arsenic concentrations in
              contacting porewaters and groundwaters.
