Abstract    :
              The electromagnetic coupling between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere
              ultimately takes place through small-scale currents and fields.  Auroral arcs
              form on scales smaller than 1 kilometer.  This project will investigate the
              processes by which electromagnetic energy can be transferred to these small
              scales in the topside auroral ionosphere.  It will focus on two of primary
              processes: (1) linear phase mixing of Alfven waves where there are
              perpendicular gradients in the Alfven speed, and (2) nonlinear interactions
              between Alfven waves trapped in the ionospheric Alfven resonator.  The research
              will be carried out by using two and three dimensional simulations of the
              propagation of Alfven waves using a nonlinear MHD code.  The currently existing
              linear MHD code will be modified to include electron inertial effects along
              auroral field lines.  It will include the effects of the formation of density
              cavities and the outflow of ions along auroral field lines.
