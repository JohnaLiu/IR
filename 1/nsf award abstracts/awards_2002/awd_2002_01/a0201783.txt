Under this Investigator Initiated Award, studies will be
              performed that will improve understanding of the fundamental biomechanics of
              skeletal muscle and its mechanical response to stretch injury and healing.  In
              particular, the stretch rate and stimulation effects on normal muscle behavior,
              and that of muscle recovering from eccentric stretch injury will be addressed. 
               Skeletal muscle is a complex material that exhibits nonlinear viscoelastic
              behavior.  Mechanical response to uniaxial stretch begins with nonlinear
              strain-stiffening, or toe-in behavior, followed by a linear response, and
              ultimately material softening prior to failure.  Sensitivity to stretch rate
              and stimulation state variations, in both healthy and stretch-injured skeletal
              muscles, will be examined in vivo in rabbit Tibialis Anterior muscles.  The PIs
              new phenomenological muscle model consisting of a nonlinear Maxwell fluid
              element combined in parallel with a contractile element and a stimulation
              induced linear spring, already demonstrated to explain the mechanical response
              outlined above, in conjunction with a carefully planned statistical design,
              will be used to interpret the experimental load-displacement data.  Results of
              the studies have the potential of influencing treatment plans for skeletal
              muscle injuries.
