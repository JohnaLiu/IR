Under this Investigator Initiated Award, the PIs will develop
              methods to characterize cardiac motion from 4D echocardiographic images (3D
              over time), thus taking advantage of advances made in recent decades by
              cardiologists in imaging technologies and by engineers in strain analyses.  A
              multidisciplinary team will analyze 4D ultrasound images in a database obtained
              with a novel 4D ultrasound scanner at Columbia. The proposal has three
              objectives:  1) Establish a parametric 4D representation of endocardial wall
              motion in a parameter space optimally suited to detecting regional wall motion
              abnormalities and test potential detection strategies, 2) Use a 3D finite
              element model to estimate the sizes of ischemic regions or scars that would
              produce detectable wall motion abnormalities on 3D ultrasound images and 3)
              select a method for displaying information on detected wall motion
              abnormalities that best enhances detection while promoting acceptance among
              cardiologists.  Teaching materials will be developed to describe various
              historical approaches to analyzing heart function and to outline the current
              state of the art.
