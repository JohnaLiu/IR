Abstract    :
              This study aims to observe and analyze the car-following behavior of subjects
              who do not know they are part of an experiment, and to develop a model that can
              explain the stochastic effects in car-following behavior across and within
              drivers, as well as those caused by variability of critical factors such as
              human characteristics, traffic and road characteristics, and environmental
              characteristics.  This is a significant improvement over previous empirical
              studies, conducted sparingly by pairs of trained professional traffic engineers
              on closed test tracks.  The results of this project should contribute
              significantly to the development of more realistic microscopic car-following
              laws that incorporate variation across and within individual drivers.  A
              combination of inertial, GPS, infrared sensing, and video equipment will be
              used to collect the data. The lead (control) vehicle will be driven by an
              experimenter, but it is the behavior of the follower (random members of the
              driving population) that will be observed.  Video will be used for manual
              confirmation of recorded events, as well as to record certain characteristics
              that might play a statistically relevant role, including human, traffic and
              road, and environmental parameters.
