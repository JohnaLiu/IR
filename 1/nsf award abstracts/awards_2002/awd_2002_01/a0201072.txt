Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research are to advance the understanding of cloud
              development and precipitation formation and to provide observations that can be
              used for evaluating large-eddy simulations of air flow and mixing processes in
              clouds.  The work is based on observations using ground-based remote sensing
              instruments consisting of a vertically-pointing 94 GHz (3.2 mm wavelength)
              radar, a UHF wind-profiling radar, and a newly built vertically-pointing X-band
              (3.2 cm wavelength) radar.  Together, these radars enable the measurement of
              vertical motions of both the air and the raindrops in clouds.  The fall speed
              of the drops relative to the air can be determined, enabling the estimation of
              the drop-size distribution.  The main site of the experiments is a field
              station at Virginia Key, although the equipment will be installed on a 20-ft
              trailer to enable observations from other locations.  Observations will be used
              to document the structure of fair-weather cumulus clouds as well as the
              relations between precipitation development and vertical air motions in clouds
              producing heavy rain.  The work contributes to precipitation physics by direct
              observation and to cloud modeling by providing the data needed for validating
              numerical simulations.
