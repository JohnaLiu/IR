This three-year award involves researchers and graduate
              students at two national centers of photonics research:  Boston University's
              Photonics Center and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology's (Lausanne) new
              Microelectronics System Laboratory and National Competence Center for Research
              in Photonics.  The project is led by M. Selim Unlu in the US and Yusuf
              Leblebici and Marc Ilegems in Switzerland. The research is aimed at the
              fabrication on the same chip of integrated opto-electronic transreceivers, and
              the development of input and output signals transmitted over a bundle of
              optical fibers or on a single fiber.  

This international cooperative
              program brings together researchers with complementary expertise.  Professor
              Unlu and his students work on design, fabrication and characterization of
              optoelectronic devices with specific expertise in resonant-cavity enhanced
              (RCE) photodector structures.  These structures will be fabricated using double
              -SOI silicon process. Silicon is recognized as the material of choice for
              large-scale integration in electronics and computing. US expertise is
              complemented by Swiss experience in clock/data recovery (CDR) circuitry
              development.  The investigators propose to integrate RCE and CDR on the same
              chip.  The expected product is a commercially viable single chip for
              applications in high-speed, optical telecommunications and data transmissions
              using fiber channels.
