This award continues the successful NSF-supported Design
              Projects' program at North Dakota State University in which students design and
              build custom projects for individual persons with disabilities. The objectives
              of the activity are to enhance engineering education, provide students with
              insight into careers in rehabilitation, improve the quality of life of people
              with disabilities, and serve the community. The different design projects meet
              special needs of individuals that are not addressed by commercial devices.
              

Approximately 40 engineering students participate annually in the Design
              Projects' activity with facilities provided in three separate laboratories for
              analysis, prototyping, printed circuit board layout, fabrication, and
              redesign/development. The engineering students interact with 8 organizations
              involved with aiding persons with disabilities to identify candidates who would
              benefit from the program's activities.

Design Projects completed each year
              of the award are to be published in an Annual Review available at
              http://nsf-pad.bme.uconn.edu/.
