The proposed research will refine and test, through collection
              of and comparison with new field data, a preliminary Geographic Information
              Systems (GIS) model designed to identify locales having a high likelihood that
              human-derived archeological artifacts will surface on mountain glaciers and
              icefields. Preliminary research has demonstrated that such locales can be
              identified using this method, which utilizes a combination of social/cultural,
              biological, remote sensing and geologic data.  Glaciers and ice patches are
              melting at an unprecedented rate, because of the current high rate of arctic
              warming.  It is anticipated that increasingly older and significant artifacts,
              paleontological and other materials will be exposed in the resulting thawed
              areas.  An estimated 10% of the world's land surface is covered by perennial
              snow, glaciers and icefields.  Organic remains locked within these environments
              remain largely unexplored.  Results obtained during preliminary work on these
              regions include recovery of rare and unique artifacts that can potentially make
              significant contributions to our understanding of human colonization and
              adaptation.  The apparent acceleration of global warming, and the consequent
              melting of continental ice, creates an urgent need to develop the means to
              locate and preserve such frozen remains before the newly exposed materials
              decompose or are otherwise destroyed.   The proposed research addresses this
              crucial issue.
