Abstract    :
              The proposed project is to initiate a fundamental heat transfer study of the
              head and neck system to predict the brain temperature.  The research will
              involve the collaborative efforts of an engineering research at Rice University
              and a medical researcher at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
              Center.  There is considerable data at present to justify the need to know the
              brain temperature in infants who have suffered hypoxia-ischemia, or are at
              great risk for hypoxia-ischemia.  Similar considerations extend to other
              patient age groups including children and adults with head trauma, surgical
              correction of congenital heart disease, and adults with stroke. A thermal model
              for head and neck will be initiated by incorporating the relation between
              metabolic heat generation and temperature, the effect of physiological
              parameters and regulatory mechanisms on the cerebral blood flow and the
              countercurrent heat transfer in the neck's vessels.  As a component of Dr. A.
              Laptook's ongoing investigations on newborn miniature swine brain at UTSMC,
              additional measurements will be made available to Dr. Y. Bayazitoglu at Rice to
              include them in her head and neck thermal modeling, to determine how brain
              temperature is affected by acute alterations in arterial oxygen tension,
              arterial carbon dioxide tension, brain metabolic rate, and brain ischemia.
The
              initiated research will provide foundation of important future contributions in
              understanding the pathogenesis of brain injury, and in monitoring of brain
              temperature during therapeutic interventions. In addition, the created
              mathematical models will eventually be used as teaching tools to search for
              optimal treatment by incorporating temperature as another variable.
