              ABSTRACT

PIs: Douglas Lind and Selim Tuncel 
Proposal:
              DMS-0222452
Institution: University of Washington


 

This proposal
              requests funding for a Concentration Year in 
Dynamical Systems at the
              University of Washington. A major
focus of activity will be a collaborative
              effort to solve
the Furstenberg Conjecture, a central problem in
              dynamics.
Participants in the program will include a mix of
              long-term
participants, including regular faculty, visiting
              faculty,
post-docs, and graduate students at the University of 
Washington,
              and short-term visitors. 

NSF funds will be used to support graduate student
              travel
to conference and workshops and six junior short terms
visitors.
