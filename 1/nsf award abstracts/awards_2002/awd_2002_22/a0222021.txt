Abstract    :
              This proposal is for the purpose of planning and carrying out a series of 5
              workshops between SRS/NSF and scientific and technical professional societies.
              This activity had been conducted in the past as a way for the professional
              societies and NSF to use their data in complementary fashion. The purpose of
              the workshops is to continue to build these relationships.
