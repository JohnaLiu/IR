Abstract    :
              The Hawaii EPSCoR Planning grant continues to assess the strengths and
              weaknesses of the current R&D system in Hawaii and design an NSF Research
              Infrastructure Improvement project to materially strengthen the competitiveness
              of the State's academic institutions in research areas of national and local
              importance.    The two major universities, the University of Hawaii-Manoa and
              the University of Hawaii-Hilo, have established a team that is taking a
              system-wide approach to the EPSCoR planning effort.  The process also
              encompasses Hawaii's system of Community Colleges to increase entry into
              science, technology, engineering, and mathematics career tracks.

The
              planning process is designed to: (1) assist the state in better aligning
              University of Hawaii system priorities with NSF EPSCoR goals; (2) use
              applicable best practices from other states; (3) better coordinate all Federal
              EPSCoR programs to maximize their impact in Hawaii; (4) select research focus
              areas that are of high importance to Hawaii and where a strong collaborative
              relationship can be developed between the Manoa and Hilo campuses; and (5)
              advise on the best strategies to build nationally-recognized programs in the
              selected research focus areas.  These goals will result in a coordinated
              state-wide effort to improve academic R&D capabilities in targeted disciplines,
              enhance training and education for students in science and engineering, and
              increase efforts to promote transfer of technology from the state's
              universities to Hawaii's private and public sectors.
