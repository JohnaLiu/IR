Abstract    :
              Building upon the current two-year Computer Science Associate Degree Program,
              Salish Kootenai College will develop and implement a Bachelors of Information
              Technology Program (BIT) using the TCUP five-year implementation award. 

The
              structure of the BIT will enable students to obtain the most recent industry
              certifications such as those developed by Microsoft and Cisco and to pursue
              different educational tracks including networking, wireless communications,
              security and database administration. Components of the BIT will be offered
              online and through summer "boot camps", allowing working professionals the
              opportunity to upgrade their knowledge. Project activities include development
              of curriculum, faculty and facilities.  Project funds will also support student
              recruitment, retention and internship programs.
