Abstract    :
              The project plans to solve two important network problems facing distributed
              computation and Grids.  The first problem is to provide a sufficiently flexible
              and robust framework for authentication and authorization, and the second
              problem is to provide secure mechanisms to allow researchers to upload new or
              enhanced measurement tools in a secure and trustworthy fashion.  Building on
              the National Internet Measurement Infrastructure (NIMI), the project plans to
              evolve NIMI to a truly large scale implementation.  Work involves migrating
              messaging, authentication and authorization to commonly used components, and
              mitigating some of the security problems associated with uploading measurement
              tools by building fine-grained delegation support and different levels of
              security.  These structures can be used for various forms of distributed
              passive monitoring and security monitoring such as intrusion detection
              systems.

The NIMI architecture will be extended to support open large-scale
              grid technologies.  The overall vision is to encourage researchers, especially
              grid-proejcts, to build clients which will interact with the NIMI
              infrastructure.  The infrastructure can then be used for secure, flexible
              command and control mechanisms, and also be sued for distributed passive
              monitoring.
