Abstract    :
              This project will take techniques for identifying finite-time approximations to
              invariant manifolds in simple dynamical systems, further develop these so that
              they can be applied to complex, time-dependent fluid flows containing many
              coherent structures, and then use the improved techniques to examine transport
              in flows near strongly eddying oceanic fronts.  A particular goal is to
              quantify the role of non-local transport events in the stirring produced by
              coherent structures and to examine the relation between Lagrangian dispersion
              statistics and the degree of hyperbolicity of the flow field.  The project will
              extend two-dimensional lobe dynamics to quasi-three-dimensional flows.  The
              oceanic flows to be studied are high-resolution, general circulation model
              representations of the Loop Current system in the Gulf of Mexico and of the
              Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic.
