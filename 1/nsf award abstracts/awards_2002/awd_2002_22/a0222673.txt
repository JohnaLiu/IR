Abstract    :
              This project will maintain and enhance the GLOBE teacher's guide in print, on
              the Web and on CD-ROM.  The teacher's guide is a nearly 1,000 page document
              containing detailed instructions for setting up study sites, collecting data,
              and implementing math and science learning in the classroom.  In addition, two
              teacher's enhancement guides will be developed for elementary and middle school
              teachers who participate in the GLOBE program.  One guide will help teachers
              accomplish the Inquiry and Personal and Social components of the National
              Science Education Standards, and the other will help teachers develop their
              student's literacy and language arts through participation in GLOBE.
