Abstract    :
              The long range goal of this project is to investigate a framework that can
              improve understanding of the topology/connectivity of complex biological
              pathways.  This research combines experimental molecular genetics with
              computational systems biology to develop new approaches for mapping complex
              signal transduction pathways in eukaryotic cells.  The initial system for study
              is the Ras and Tor pathways in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  The
              research will employ data sets from whole genome expression analysis to develop
              and validate the pathway map.  The research will focus on three avenues of
              analysis with the objectives: (1) to study a genetic epistasis analysis
              approach using extensive DNA microarray data to define a qualitative
              connectivity map of the pathways, (2) investigate a new computational systems
              approach based on a superstructure representation and a mixed integer linear
              optimization framework for the prediction of the topology of the complex
              pathways, and (3) study a quantitative analysis framework for the effect of
              model uncertainty on the network topology of the metabolic pathways.
