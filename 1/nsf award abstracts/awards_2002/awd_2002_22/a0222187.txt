Proposal: DMS-0222187
Institution: University of Missouri at
              Columbia


 

This proposal requests funding for a conference on
              Harmonic
Analysis and Partial Differential Equations to be held in 
Columbia,
              Missouri during the period May 8--11, 2002. The 
conference will last 4 four
              days and is expected to have
70-80 participants among which 20 will be invited
              speakers.
Several world's leading experts in the emerging connections
              
between combinatorics, analysis and PDE will speak at this
conference. NSF
              funds will be use to support travel expenses
and room and board for thirty
              graduate students.
