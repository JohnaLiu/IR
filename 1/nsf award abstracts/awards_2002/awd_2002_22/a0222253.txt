Abstract    :
              Increasing our understanding of sea ice dynamics is vital because of the role
              sea ice plays in global atmospheric and ocean dynamics. In particular, the
              ability to better predict the opening of cracks in the ice, or leads, will
              improve our understanding of the Earth's weather, climate and ecology, as well
              as our ability to navigate Artic waters.  Existing ice models have been of
              limited usefulness for forecasting the location and orientation of new leads
              and make no attempt to calculate the degree to which any given lead will open
              for predicted, or even observed forcing conditions. Even if effective models
              existed, until recently, there have been no data available for verification. We
              propose research that will exploit two significant developments and will
              ultimately allow accurate predictions of lead opening and orientation. First,
              motion of material points on large-scale regions of the Arctic ice cover have
              been recorded and are now available for complete winter seasons. Second,
              theoretical and numerical procedures have been recently developed for
              describing crack formation through the use of cohesive crack models. The
              proposed research is to develop a multi-scale, computational procedure to
              predict crack initiation, orientation, and width, in sea ice, under an observed
              set of loading conditions, and to verify the procedure using the newly
              available data. The successful completion of the research will set the stage
              for the next generation of models and numerical procedures in which realistic
              geophysical forces can be used to predict the detailed behavior of the Arctic
              ice cover.

For the first time, large-scale motion data are available for
              points on the Artic ice cover.  This unique dataset, produced by the Jet
              Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), is derived from high-resolution, spaceborn,
              Synthetic Aperature Radar (SAR) imagery, acquired by the RADARSAT satellite. 
              These data are exactly what is needed to form a complete picture of ice
              deformation. A striking aspect of these images is linear features indicating
              the formation of leads, or openings in the sea ice. The ability to better
              predict the opening of leads will improve our understanding of the Earth's 
              weather, climate and ecology, as well as our ability to navigate Artic waters. 
              Existing ice models have been of limited usefulness for forecasting the
              location and orientation of new leads and make no attempt to calculate the
              degree to which any given lead will open for predicted, or even observed
              forcing conditions. Even if effective models existed, until recently, there
              have been no data available for verification.  We propose to use the JPL data
              to develop and verify new material models for sea ice in order to predict crack
              initiation, orientation, and width. The successful completion of the research
              will set the stage for the next generation of models and numerical procedures
              in which realistic geophysical forces can be used to predict the detailed
              behavior of the Arctic ice cover.  Moreover, sea ice is a central element in
              the Earth's climate system.  An accurate ice model will benefit our ability to
              understand past climatic variability and to improve predictive capabilities
              through its inclusion in global ocean and climate models.
