Abstract    :
              It is becoming increasingly difficult for scientists to identify, manage, and
              process all the information needed to conduct their research. Information work
              is especially complex in fields like neuroscience where new discoveries may
              require understanding of an extensive body of accumulated knowledge and the
              research is often carried out by multidisciplinary teams. This project
              investigates the information activities and resources associated with advances
              and roadblocks in neuroscience research. A typology of information work will be
              developed based on data recorded by participating neuroscientists on their
              day-to-day information needs and practices and on their specific experiences
              testing a new data mining system. Case studies of incidents that represent
              different types of information work will be built through field studies at
              three laboratory sites. Case files will be analyzed to develop profiles of high
              impact information, critical information problems, and effective combinations
              of information activities, resources, and tools. Constraints on the transfer
              and exchange of information within research teams and between specializations
              and disciplines will be documented and compared across the sites. The analysis
              will specify information technology needed to improve neuroscientists' ability
              to synthesize existing research results and share information and to support
              different modes of discovery and collaboration.
