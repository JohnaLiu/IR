Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project analyses the historical emergence of the
              notion of the scientific model, and specifically the emergence of the
              assumption that models are universally valid representations of nature, by
              investigating the role of anatomical models for the formation of science and
              the state around 1800. Using archival sources and surviving model collections,
              the project will analyze and compare practices of model production and model
              use at two state institutions where science was developed in its conceptual and
              institutional framework explicitly for state use: a public naturalhistory
              museum and model workshop founded during physiocratic reforms in late
              eighteenth-century Tuscany, and a military training hospital established in
              enlightened absolutist Austria. The project will focus on three question areas:
              1) How does the interplay between conceptual developments and social dynamics
              within the workshop establish the models as universal representations, and how
              does model use support or challenge these claims to universality? 2) What kind
              of science was developed conceptually and institutionally through model
              production and model use at the museum, and at the hospital? 3) What is the
              envisioned function of this science for the state, and what is the function of
              the image of the human body conveyed through the models for enlightened
              absolutism and subsequent regimes? Fund are for travel to relevant research
              sites in Florence and other parts of  Italy.
