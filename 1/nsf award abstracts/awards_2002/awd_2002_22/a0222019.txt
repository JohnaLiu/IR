Abstract    :
              The 2002 GONG Meeting and the 12th SOHO Workshop will be held jointly, October
              27-31, 2002, at Big Bear Lake, California. This workshop will focus on the
              study of the interior of the sun from a seismic perspective and also the
              prospects for similar study of other solar-like stars. It will also provide an
              unique opportunity to invite the scientific community to pause and reflect on
              the status of this fertile field of study, just past the first solar maximum
              since the deployment of the GONG network and the successful operation of SOHO.
              Significant time will be devoted to working group sessions, where outstanding,
              unresolved or controversial issues will be discussed.
