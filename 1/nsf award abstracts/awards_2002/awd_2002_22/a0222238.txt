Abstract    :
              This project involves a novel approach to the representation of sub-grid scale
              physics based on the assumption that there is self-similarity between the
              unresolved scales and the finest scales resolved.  Computational geometry
              techniques will be used to represent structures seen in the resolved scales;
              optimization techniques will be used to quantify the relation between similar
              structures at different scales; finally self-similarity will be used to
              extrapolate these structures to unresolved scales.  The techniques developed
              will be tested by applying them to two classes of dynamical simulations.  The
              first is airflow over rough terrain and the second is groundwater transport in
              complex porous media.  The work is a collaboration between mathematicians and
              scientists working in the area of environmental fluid mechanics.  It will offer
              interdisciplinary research training, bridging mathematics, computational
              science and geophysical fluid flow, to graduate students.
