Abstract    :
              "Symposium H: 3D Nanoengineered Assemblies", to be held in the context of the
              2002 Materials Research Society (MRS) Fall Meeting in Boston, MA, during
              December 2-6, 2002.  The Symposium will provide a forum for scientific and
              technical exchange to advance the practice and progress of nanoengineering in
              three dimensions.  The symposium will explore 3-D processing techniques with
              the promise to transport or modify material on the nanometer scale, as
              alternatives to conventional 2-D techniques.

The technologies to be
              addressed include soft lithography, self assembly, biological or
              biomimetic-based processing, atomic manipulation using scanning probes, as well
              as non-contact methods such as holography, nonlinear optical processes,
              particle beam material interactions, and materials manipulation with an eye on
              developing 3-D nanoengineered systems and embedded 3-D nanostructures with
              nanometer scale resolution.
