Abstract    :
              As the objective of vision (human and machine) is to compute a hierarchy of
              increasingly abstract interpretations of the observed images or image
              sequences,  it is of fundamental importance to know what are the concepts used
              at each level of interpretation. In more plain language, what are the visual
              "strokes", visual "characters", and visual "words"?  Or what are the visual
              "electrons", "atoms" and "molecules"?     The goal of the proposed research is
              to discover dictionaries of various levels of visual concepts that correspond
              to fundamental topologic,  photometric, geometric, and  dynamic structures of
              the images and scenes.  In a mathematical language, these structures are the
              low dimensional manifolds embedded in very high dimensional image space.


              More specifically, we propose to  construct top-down generative models for
              natural images, 3D surfaces, human faces, video sequences, and 2D shape
              contours. The fundamental atomic structures are defined by parameters in the
              generative models, and these parameters are  estimated by fitting the models to
              the training data. These structures are intrinsic to the ensemble of natural
              images and video. We propose stochastic (Markov chain Monte Carlo) learning
              algorithms which is capable of computing globally optimal solutions.
