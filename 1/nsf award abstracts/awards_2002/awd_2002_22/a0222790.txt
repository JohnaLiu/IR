Abstract    :
              With NSF support, Windward Community College (WCC) will conduct an assessment of
              its science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) curriculum and
              infrastructure, and develop an integrated institutional plan to improve and
              enhance WCC's STEM curriculum and infrastructure. The proposed 12-month effort
              will be divided into three phases: Phase I - Development and application of
              assessment tools for evaluation of WCC's STEM curriculum and infrastructure;
              Phase II - Development of a long-term integrated STEM enhancement plan
              including assessment instruments to evaluate progress; Phase III - Identify
              resources and secure support to implement the STEM institutional enhancement
              strategies.
