Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)
A symposium and workshop are being held at the Electrochemical
              Society meeting, in May 2002, to promote the development and use of innovative
              undergraduate chemistry course materials based on a recently discovered class
              of compounds called fullerenes. Because of their novelty and unique shapes,
              fullerenes can stimulate student interest in learning chemistry.
              Researcher/educators active in such educational uses of fullerenes are giving
              detailed presentations on their course innovations and are holding discussions
              with the other participants. Ideas and findings from this event will be
              disseminated to a broad audience of college and university faculty through
              conference proceedings and other publications.
