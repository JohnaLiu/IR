Abstract    :
              Funds are provided for a cruise to collect a suite of cores from the Southwest
              African margin to construct several detailed depth transects to monitor the
              full dynamic range and stratal geometry of the mid depth water masses. The
              post-cruise proposed research program will establish the sensitivity of
              Southern Hemisphere ocean circulation to major instability during the
              Pleistocene and Holocene by mapping changes in the distribution of radiocarbon
              in benthic foraminifera over specific abrupt events to deduce the ventilation
              history of mid-depth water and help delineate northern vs. southern
              sources.
