Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this project is to develop an integrated quantitative
              framework, consistent with existing mechanistic knowledge and well-designed
              in-house experiments, for the study and eventual enhancement of the Escherichia
              coli oxygen and redox sensing/regulatory system. Experimental data will be
              obtained from the literature and the investigators' laboratories. The specific
              goals are: (1) to construct an experimentally verifiable model of the genetic
              network of the oxygen and redox sensing/regulatory system; (2) to develop a
              scheme for distilling maps of metabolic pathways from the network models
              achieved in (1); (3) to generate metabolic patterns based on the predicted
              metabolic pathway maps using standard metabolic flux analysis techniques; (4)
              to construct mutant strains to be used in bioreactor experiments to support the
              modeling effort; and (5) to perform bioreactor experiments to generate
              quantitative data to be used to refine and validate the network and pathway
              models.
