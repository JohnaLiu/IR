Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop a new process for Ta chemical vapor
              deposition (CVD).  The deposition of TaN and Ta-Si-N films have potential
              applications in microelectronics, but useful methods for forming them have not
              been reported.  The reactants will be TaF5 and SiH4.  Calculations suggest that
              these materials are the simplest commercially available compounds that have
              favorable thermodynamics for producing Ta metal while avoiding silicide
              formation.  Films will be deposited over a range of operating conditions and
              characterization measurements will determine whether Ta metal is being
              deposited cleanly and uniformly.  Training of graduate students will be the
              primary educational impact.  The results of this project may have a significant
              impact on the microelectronics industry.  Tantalum and mixed Ta/TaNx thin films
              are the leading candidates for diffusion barrier layers, which are essential
              for advanced interconnect technology based on copper metallization.  The
              proposed work should also enhance the fundamental understanding of early
              transition metal chemistry.  The mechanistic implications of the observed
              kinetics may be useful for subsequently developing an alternating layer
              deposition technology for the reactants used in this study.
