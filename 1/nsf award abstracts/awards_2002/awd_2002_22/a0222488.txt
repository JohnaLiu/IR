Abstract    :
              The University of Hawaii Manoa, located on the island of Oahu, will implement
              the project entitled: "Hawai'i Kumu-Ola: Source of Knowledge Program". This
              five-year TCUP project will adapt a successful Native American recruitment and
              retention model used at Oregon State University to increase the number of
              Native Hawaiians and underrepresented students in STEM fields of study.

The
              project will endeavor to increase the number of Native Hawaiian and
              underrepresented students by: integrating traditional ecological knowledge in
              core courses; assisting teachers and students in the establishment of math
              learning communities; providing students with exchange, mentoring and
              internship opportunities; involving students in "hands-on" field-based
              learning; assisting students in their transition from high school to college;
              and involving students in the production and delivery of television and
              internet media used in program outreach.
