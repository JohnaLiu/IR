Abstract    :
              The proposal builds on early work in developing and deploying an on-line
              credential service, MyProxy.  MyProxy was created in 2000 to solve the problem
              of credential delegation and was specifically targeted to support web portal
              requirements. Grid entities, must be able to dynamically manage and select the
              most appropriate security credentials in order to support or complete the
              application or work.  

The project has a three-phased approach to create the
              persistent credential management support needed for production middleware.  In
              the first phase, MyProxy will be redesigned to become more robust.  In the
              second phase, additional functional will be created, tested and deployed to
              support multiple authentication mechanisms.  In the third phase, the middleware
              will be expanded to include Web Services and Open Grid Services Architecture. 
              Overall, the project expands Grid computing will contribute to the national and
              international Grid infrastructure by making Grid computing more secure and
              easier to use.
