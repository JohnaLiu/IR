Abstract    :
              Quantities that serve in paleoclimatology as proxy data for temperature, such as
              oxygen isotope ratios measured in seabed cores, reveal periodicities ranging
              from about 1000 to 100,000 years.  These cycles are caused by a combination of
              external forcing by known changes in the Earth's orbital parameters (so-called
              Milankovitch forcing) and by little-understood, complex, nonlinear, and usually
              nonstationary interactions of different atmospheric and oceanic processes.  To
              now, the statistical tools most commonly employed for analyzing the records
              have been spectral techniques and correlation analysis based on the assumption
              of statistical stationarity.  This project examines the effects of nonlinear
              and nonstationary processes on the climate record of the last 5 million years
              by employing modern statistical techniques that have not previously seen much
              use in paleoclimatology.  These include time-frequency analysis to characterize
              the non-stationarity in terms of frequency and phase modulation, and bispectral
              and cross-spectral analysis to different combinations of climate variables to
              recognize nonlinear couplings.  One of the objectives of the project, which is
              supported jointly by the Division of Atmospheric Sciences and the Division of
              Mathematical Sciences, is to make these statistical methods available to the
              paleoclimate community by offering software to students and researchers and
              arranging a workshop devoted to the subject.
