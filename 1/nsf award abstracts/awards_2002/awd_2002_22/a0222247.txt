Abstract    :
              This project will be a five-week summer school on the topic of spatio-temporal
              statistical analysis and its application to multi-platform, multi-sensor
              bio-optical oceanic data.  The summer school seeks to address some of the
              analysis challenges anticipated as the Integrated Ocean Observing System is
              established.  These are associated with the very diverse range of spatial and
              temporal sampling afforded by the different components of such a system and
              contemporaneous process experiments.  Statistical experts in spatial
              information engineering with experience in collaboration with ocean scientists
              will discuss some of the modern tools for statistical analysis of such data and
              associated challenges, while ocean scientists will introduce students to the
              data and the underlying science questions.  The primary focus will be on
              analysis of the distribution of phytoplankton, which is known to be a patchy
              and intermittent field, the interpretation of measurements of which are
              complicated by advection.  This should serve as a model for the study of
              statistical techniques that can then be applied to other environmental fields. 
              An interdisciplinary group of approximately 16 students will be recruited, half
              with background in mathematical sciences and half with ocean science
              backgrounds.  The goal is to introduce students to interdisciplinary research
              questions and provide stimulating ideas that they can subsequently apply in
              their dissertation research.
