Abstract    :
              The goal of this collaborative proposal between the University of California at
              Santa Cruz and Duke University is the definition of features for recognition
              and classification of objects in imagery. Feature vectors are enriched and made
              invariant at the same time by an efficient, probabilistic coding of the
              feature-space manifolds that are obtained when features undergo all possible
              transformations in a predefined class. This coding is designed to circumvent
              the curse of dimensionality by reducing the representation requirements to the
              two properties that are essential for recognition and classification, that is,
              uniqueness and continuity. Uniqueness requires different manifolds to be coded
              differently, while continuity requires similar codings for similar
              manifolds.

Theoretical and empirical investigations will study optimal
              feature design, the performance of these features with various classification
              and recognition methods, and the trade-off of computational efficiency and
              performance. Misclassification rates for families of features and
              transformations will also be measured, both by theoretical bounds and empirical
              tests. The behavior of the proposed representations will be examined in the
              presence of clutter and data corruptions such as occlusions. These concepts
              will be tested through their application to the automatic diagnosis of colon
              cancer from computerized tomography scans, and to the interpretation of
              American sign language from video sequences.
