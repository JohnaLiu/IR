Abstract    :
              	This dissertation would investigate how social networks explain the health
              advantage of first-generation Mexican-American immigrants over
              second-generation Mexican-Americans born in this country.   The research uses
              participant observation and in depth interviews with 60 first- and
              second-generation adult Mexican Americans in Detroit to describe how local and
              transnational networks differ between the generations and how these network
              differences help explain differences in health outcomes.
