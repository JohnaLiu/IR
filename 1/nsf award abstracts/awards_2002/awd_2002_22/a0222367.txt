Abstract    :
              The long range goal of this project is to develop an understanding of the
              connections between the structure of complex enzyme-promoted metabolic networks
              and their structural capacity to admit more than one steady state. More
              generally, the Principal Investigator (PI) is interested in connecting his long
              experience with intricate reaction networks to important problems in both cell
              biology and biotechnology.
