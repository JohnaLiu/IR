Abstract    :
              gThe major goal of the research is to understand the molecular mechanisms
              responsible for the formation of new species of microorganisms. The research
              will target a single gene known to separate two closely related naturally
              occurring species of yeast in the genus Pichia.  The two species live in two
              different cactus types that have major differences in their host chemistry.  
              Toxic natural products in one cactus type deter the growth of one species while
              allowing growth of the other.   Identifying and isolating the gene(s)
              responsible for this difference is the specific goal of the research.  A
              molecular genetic knockout library recently created for baker's yeast will be
              used to identify the candidate genes. 

This research addresses the nature of
              the fundamental process involved in the formation of new species.  It could
              provide us with 1) the detailed molecular mechanism responsible for adaptation
              to novel chemicals in natural plants and 2) the reasons for increased genetic
              and biological diversity in microorganisms.  An important aspect of the work is
              the use of modern genomic information from the widely studied baker's yeasts to
              learn about the origin of new species in natural systems.
