Abstract    :
              This project is a three-week summer school that looks at the interactions
              between atmospheric and oceanic sciences on the one hand and modern applied
              mathematics on the other.  It is built around the three themes of numerics,
              stochastics and asymptotics.  The numerics component emphasizes the development
              of modern conservative advection schemes and interface tracking schemes for
              geophysical transport problems.  The asymptotics component emphasizes the
              dynamics of balanced flows, reduced models and homogenization.  The stochastics
              component covers a variety of topics including particle models, stochastic
              calculus, kinetic theory and applications to Lagrangian stirring and moist
              convection.  Approximately 15 faculty provide lectures and mentor the students
              as they conduct short projects to apply the lecture material.  The student body
              consists of 20 or more graduate students and approximately 12 post-doctoral
              researchers.  Faculty and students are drawn from both the geosciences and the
              mathematics communities.
