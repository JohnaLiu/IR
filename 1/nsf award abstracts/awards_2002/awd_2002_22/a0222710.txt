Abstract    :
              The multi-institutional project focuses on a novel integration of video
              conferencing clients and services with NMI Middleware standards, functions and
              services.  The outcome will be a videoconferencing application directory
              enabling secure, inter-domain authentication for calls that transit
              institutional organizational boundaries.    A testbed for video middleware will
              be established to test the architecture, its implementation using multiple
              products, and the interoperability of these products.  Testbed results will be
              provided to the higher education and research community in the form of a video
              middleware "cookbook".  The project has identified 4 goals.
 - develop the NMI
              Release 1 communications object class for use in H.323, SIP, MPEG2, VRVS and
              Access Grid implementations
 - develop a framework for specification of
              videoconferencing security requirements
 - develop a testbed to deploy and
              test middleware-ware, inter-operable videoconferencing services.
- disseminate
              the results through conferences, publications including a Video Middleware
              Cookbook

The proposal is based on substantial experience building ViDe.Net,
              the international videoconferencing service for higher education.  As the
              global internet becomes a true multi-service infrastructure, use of internet
              videoconferencing will increase throughout education, including K-12.  The
              ability to look up and connect to resources through secure, easy-to-use
              interfaces will enable greater use of this technology to enhances classroom
              instruction and overcome geographic and economic disadvantage.
