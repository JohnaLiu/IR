Abstract    :
              In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning and
              Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is
              designed to meet GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and
              schoolchildren in a global information network with the ultimate goal of better
              understanding Earth's environment and changes that take place within it.  This
              proposal consists of various segments addressing GLOBE Program needs: support
              for an existing protocol, support for teacher training and outreach, data
              quality control, student surveys on attitudes about the environment and climate
              misconceptions, and finally, scientific research based on GLOBE data.
This
              proposal will support the existing Atmosphere Protocols including an assessment
              of the quality of the data already received. Information from other GLOBE
              investigations (Soils, Land Cover/Biology, Phenology) and external data will be
              used to address scientific questions relating to climate feedback, including
              that of human-caused land-use changes.
