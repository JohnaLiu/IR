Abstract    :
              Large-eddy simulation (LES) is an important computational method for analyzing
              small-scale atmospheric circulations.  Depending on the density of the
              computational grid, LES can accurately depict eddies and vortices with scales
              as small as a few meters.  Still smaller eddies become increasingly important
              at altitudes close to the ground.  A fundamental problem with LES is that the
              eddies in the surface layer immediately next to the ground cannot be resolved
              and must be parameterized - that is, in calculations of the heat and momentum
              flux in the atmosphere near the ground, the effects of subgrid-scale (SGS)
              processes must be approximated.  The goal of this research is to develop
              improved models of SGS processes for use in the atmospheric surface layer.  The
              approach is to analyze data taken with a specially designed array of sonic
              anemometers during the SGS2000 field project conducted in the San Joaquin
              Valley, California.  These data provide unique information on the time and
              space structure of the wind near the ground with high resolution.  The
              objectives of the work are (1) to investigate the effects of SGS fluxes on
              resolvable processes by use of joint probability functions of the resolvable
              velocity components and the resolvable temperature and velocity; (2) to
              understand the relationship between SGS fluxes and the resolvable velocity and
              temperature.  Together, these will identify characteristics of the SGS flux
              that are important for resolvable processes and contribute directly to LES
              modeling.  Progress in turbulence modeling is important not only for
              meteorology but also for other geophysical and engineering applications.
