Abstract    :
              This award is to support research that will develop new data on the effect of
              changing climate on the climatically sensitive upper forest limit in the Pirin
              Mountains.

Fieldwork will be undertaken to collect samples from a series of
              cirque lakes near the upper forest limit in the Pirin Mountains.  Plant
              macrofossil data and radiocarbon dating will supplement pollen data already in
              hand.  In addition, stable isotope analysis of carbonate in lake sediments will
              be used as an independent method of climate reconstruction.

The broader
              impacts of this proposed research are that it will lead to a better
              understanding of the vegetational and climatic history of an area that is
              transitional between Western Europe and the continental interior.
