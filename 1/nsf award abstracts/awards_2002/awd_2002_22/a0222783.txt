Abstract    :
              The National Science Foundation began the development of the National Science
              Digital Library (NSDL) several years ago and it is scheduled to come online
              this coming year.  The NSDL is a connection or system of separate data or
              information sources.  Bringing these disparate sources together is a complex
              issue, from both the technical perspective and organization dynamics

This
              study will focus on the institutionalization of NSDL from both a technical and
              contextual perspective.  The latter includes such factors as priorities and
              culture of the participating organizations, how they interact with the
              technical considerations. A comparative case study will be used, with the
              internet serving as a comparison, a system that has already been
              institutionalized and studied.  The study will provide an evaluative framework
              to employ with the NSDL as it is implemented but will be applicable to
              large-scale IT systems, as well.
