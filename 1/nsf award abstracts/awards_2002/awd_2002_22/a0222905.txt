Abstract    :
              
In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning and
              Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is
              designed to meet GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and
              schoolchildren in a global information network with the ultimate goal of better
              understanding Earth's environment and changes that take place within it.  This
              proposal will support existing protocols, and conduct scientific research with
              GLOBE data.  The project will continue to support the protocol for the
              measurement of snow and cloud cover, as well as soil moisture.  In addition,
              this team will develop new protocols for the measurement of Surface
              Temperature, and lead the Soil Moisture investigation.
This team is already
              using past GLOBE data to do validation work for the snow detection algorithm
              and cloud screening technique from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer
              (MODIS) on NASA's Terra satellite, and this grant will allow validation work on
              the MODIS surface temperature measurements. This grant will form part of an
              energy-budget suite of GLOBE investigations that will cover soil temperature
              and moisture, atmospheric temperature and humidity, cloud cover, and aerosol
              optical thickness - all factors that must be considered in an energy budget.
