Abstract    :
              The project will improve MPICH-G2 collective operation performance to the state
              of the art and also improve MPICH-G2's point-to-point TCP performance.  Since
              MPICH-G2 is a popular package and has been used in a variety of Grid projects
              and applications, improvement will increase its usage and effectiveness. 
              MPICH-G2 has been used to set and utilize QoS parameters having real-time
              network latency and bandwidth requirements, and has also been used in
              client/server scientific visualization applications.  The project will
              implement a solution to the new symbol collision problem, which will also
              broaden the base to include a new class of computing platforms, the Linux
              Cluster.  The proposed enhancements coupled with the extension of MPICH-G2's
              platform base to include Linux clusters, are significant improvements.  The
              broader impact of this work will be realized by MPI application developers as
              the proposed activities will significantly increase the utility of MPICH-G2 as
              an effective middleware tool.

This tool as been used in a number of
              traditional scientific applications, most notably receiving the Gordon Bell
              Prize, Special Category, for its role in an astrophysics application used for
              solving problems.  The work will significantly improve teh bandwidth for large
              messages over non-vendor MPI communications and will further promote MPI as an
              effective Grid API for non-traditional scientific applications.
