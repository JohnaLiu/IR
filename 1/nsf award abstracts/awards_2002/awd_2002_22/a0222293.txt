Abstract    :
              May 22, 2002 is the closing date for NSF's High Performance Network Connections
              (02-73) solicitation.  HPNC proposals are complex documents that include many
              nuances and requirements.  This workshop will take the participants through the
              proposal preparation process and assist investigators in developing their
              proposals.  This workshop will cover the technical, administrative and research
              justifications that are required, and the workshop will address budget, format
              and narrative requirements.

The workshop will be a one day, hands-on event
              where the participants actually begin preparation of their HPNC proposal.  The
              day will be divided into sessions that will focus on key areas of the proposal
              development process.  Mentors will open each session with a brief discussion of
              the area of the proposal being addressed in the session.  Then, the mentors
              will be available for questions and advice during the time allotted for
              proposal writing.  Each session will contain actual proposal writing time.
