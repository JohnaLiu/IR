Abstract    :
              Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwa Community College (LCOOCC) will enhance the ability
              of rural and minority populations on and near the Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwa
              reservation in northwestern Wisconsin and at two outreach sites that serve the
              Bad River and Red Cliff bands of Ojibwa to succeed in careers in Science,
              Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The College will undertake a
              comprehensive assessment of community needs as well as institutional strengths
              and weaknesses in STEM fields. 

Assessment outcomes will drive systemic
              reform strategies, lead to more effective use of limited resources and further
              the development of the nation's technologically based workforce.  Primary goals
              of the project are threefold: (1) assessment of community and employer needs
              and opportunities for STEM-related education and professionals; (2)
              identification of strategies for increasing student enrollment, retention and
              graduation in STEM foundation courses and program areas; and, (3) evaluation of
              STEM student performance to eliminate bottlenecks and strengthen STEM
              competencies.
