Abstract    :
              0222779  Aitken  The Association of Environmental Engineering and Science
              Professors (AEESP) and the American Academy of Environmental Engineers (AAEE)
              are preparing a conference on education and research needs in environmental
              engineering and science. The conference will be held August 10-14, 2002, on the
              campus of the University of Toronto. Since no single professional society
              represents the entire field, this conference provides a unique opportunity for
              the community of educators, researchers and practitioners in environmental
              engineering and science to discuss mutual interests, compare methods, and
              identify needs for the advancement of the profession.
The overall theme of the
              conference is Integrated Environmental Teaching, Research and Practice: Linking
              Engineering and Science to Address Complex Problems.  Within this broad theme,
              five sub- themes will be addressed: Understanding Complex Environmental
              Systems; Use of Information Technologies for Monitoring and Data Management;
              Integrating Novel and Advanced Technologies into Understanding and Solving
              Environmental Problems; Sustainable Systems; and Innovative Educational
              Approaches. These sub-themes represent an extension of AEESP's last Research
              Needs conference (1999, Penn State), which focused on complex systems, a
              sustainable environment, and advanced molecular tools; a recognition that
              information technologies play an increasingly important role in obtaining,
              organizing and analyzing a vast amount of data for use in decision-making for
              environmental systems; and an exploration of how advanced knowledge and methods
              can be incorporated into both education and practice. Such an emphasis on the
              continuum among research, teaching, and practice is critical to the long-term
              evolution of this engineering discipline. ***
