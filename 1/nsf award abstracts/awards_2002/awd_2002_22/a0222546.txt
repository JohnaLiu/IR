With NSF support, Turtle Mountain Community College (TMCC) will
              improve its capacity to enroll, retain, and graduate Native American students
              in STEM disciplines.  The use of technology will be emphasized where it can be
              directly applied within the STEM curriculum and used as a mechanism to enhance
              teaching and learning. Faculty professional development will also focus on the
              infusion of technology into the STEM curriculum.

Project goals include
              strengthening the institution's technological infrastructure and systematically
              enhancing TMCC's STEM capacity; improving STEM teaching and learning through
              curriculum development, reform and enhancement; and, broadening student
              participation in STEM programs through improved outreach, recruitment,
              retention and graduation.  Special emphasis will focus on promoting student
              success in STEM gatekeeper and bottleneck courses.
