Abstract    :
              This is an award under the CMG program (Collaborations Between the Mathematical
              Sciences and the Geosciences) to support mathematical modeling of processes in
              the magnetosphere.  It is jointly funded by the Physical Meteorology program in
              the Division of Atmospheric Sciences and the Research in Undergraduate
              Institutions (RUI) program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences.  Phenomena
              originating in the solar wind cause magnetic pulsations upstream from the earth
              and inside the magnetosphere.  They propagate through the magnetosheath but
              their source and means of propagation are not understood.  The broad range of
              spatial scales and complex dynamics of the plasma regions affected by the
              pulsations have posed major obstacles to modeling the phenomenon.  A new
              mathematical tool, called multiresolution homogenization, circumvents some of
              the difficulties.  The method constructs mathematical models that implicitly
              account for a wide range of scales while requiring explicit modeling of only
              selected scales.  It will be applied to modeling waves in the turbulent
              magnetosheath with the objectives of (1) understanding wave propagation in the
              magnetosheath and (2) gaining insight on properties of the magnetosheath
              itself.  As society becomes more dependent on satellite communications, it is
              increasingly important to understand phenomena in the magnetosphere that affect
              electromagnetic signal propagation.
