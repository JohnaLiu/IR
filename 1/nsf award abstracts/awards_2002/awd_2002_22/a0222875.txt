Abstract    :
              This research explores perception of task-level information from kinesthetic
              sense data in mobile manipulation tasks.  A mobile manipulator interacts with
              the terrain through its feet or wheels, and it interacts with fixed or mobile
              objects through its hands, wheels, bumpers, or other effectors.  All of these
              interactions contribute to the robot's motion and to internal shape
              deformations of the robot, which can be detected by encoders, strain gauges,
              and other sensors. This kinesthetic sense data can be used to estimate features
              of the terrain, locations of objects, location of the robot, contact state
              between the robot and objects, and other task variables.  This project is
              developing a theory of task-level kinesthetic perception, by developing
              suitable models of task and robot dynamics, and using the framework of
              nonlinear observability to analyze specific tasks and develop algorithms for
              estimating task parameters and state variables.  Experimental work includes
              evaluation of several mobile manipulator designs, implementation and testing of
              observers, and demonstration in mobile manipulation tasks.
