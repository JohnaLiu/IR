Abstract    :
              This project will develop four new instructional units for GLOBE:  a middle and
              high school unit on Urban Atmosphere and a middle and high school unit on
              Coastal Ecosystems.  These units will meet the needs of school systems for
              standards-based instructional units that also meet the needs of the research
              community for data from regions undergoing high rates of environmental change. 
              In addition, the project will develop an on-line tool, "Assemble an Inquiry,"
              that will coach educators through the process of developing their own
              customized, standards-based units with the existing GLOBE materials.
