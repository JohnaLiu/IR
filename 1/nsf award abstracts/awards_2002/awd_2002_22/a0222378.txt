Abstract    :
              Although most stomatal responses to environmental factors appear to be sensed
              and transduced within the guard cells, circumstantial evidence suggests that
              this is not the case for the stomatal response to humidity.  This project
              investigates the possibility that small changes in turgor pressure in the
              mesophyll or epidermal cells initiates a cellular signaling pathway that
              ultimately leads to changes in guard cell osmotic pressure associated with
              stomatal responses to humidity.  The influence of humidity changes on
              intercellular concentrations of Ca2+ and components of phosphoinositide
              signaling pathways will be assessed in both epidermal and mesophyll cells. 
              HPLC will be used to quantify components of the phosphoinositide signaling
              pathway, and fluorescent probes will be used to quantify intercellular Ca2+
              concentrations.  For the latter experiments, a ratiometric fluorescent calcium
              indicator protein (cameleon) has been expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana.  The
              project will provide new insights into the mechanism for the stomatal response
              to humidity.  This response has a major effect on the overall water use
              efficiency of plants in both natural and agricultural settings.
