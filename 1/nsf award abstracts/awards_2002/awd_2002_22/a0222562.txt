Abstract    :
              Through this award, Honolulu Community College will conduct an assessment of its
              Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) curriculum and
              infrastructure in order to develop an institutional action plan to improve STEM
              instruction. Project activities include: development of STEM course assessment
              instruments; development of a plan to recruit Native Hawaiians into STEM
              programs; outreach to potential industry, community, and/or educational
              partners to provide student internship opportunities; and, development of a
              tracking system for STEM students and graduates who transfer to four-year
              colleges and universities and for those that gain employment in STEM fields.
