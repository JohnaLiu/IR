Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this project is to determine the relationship between
              phenotypic variations and the associated whole genome transcriptional pattern
              in populations of E.coli and S. cerevisiae cells cultivated under well defined,
              reproducible conditions.  This will be done in three types of experiments
              distinguished according to the cultivation mode.  The first type of experiments
              will involve simple batch cultivation of cells.  Samples will be taken from
              different growth stages of the culture.  The second type of experiments will
              involve continuous cultivation of cells in a chemostat operated at different
              steady states.  The third type of experiments will involve exposure of the
              cells to an environmental challenge.  Such challenges will include the shifting
              of a steady state chemostat culture to a new dilution rate.  The response to
              such a nutritional upshift or downshift will be analyzed.  In all types of
              experiments the phenotypic variability of the culture will be determined by
              flow cytometry and subpopulations of cells will be isolated via cell sorting. 
              Sorted cells will be subjected to protocols for microarray analysis to
              determine the whole genome transcriptional profile.  To make this possible an
              amplification protocol will be developed to reproducibly generate a sufficient
              amount of RNA from only a few cells to permit quantitative microarray analysis.
