Abstract    :
              The proposal plans to develop middleware that will allow individuals or groups
              using differing collaboration infrastructures to participate in an Access
              Grid-based session without the need for human intervention.  This will be done
              by developing a web services model that will allow components to be updated as
              they become available without requiring the whole framework to be reworded. 
              The proposal will develop three new modules:

1.  Network Services Engine
              which acts as the principal point of contact between the users and resolution
              engine
2.  Resolution Engine which matches user capabilities to the services
              available; it will also function as a Service Registry and,
3.  Network
              Services User Interface which provides the user's view into the network
              services framework.

The work will build on the extensive expereince base of
              the Access Grid developers.

These modules will enable users to maximize
              their use of the Access Grid.  The Network Services User Interface funnels user
              requests for resources to the Network Services Registry, and the Resolution
              Engine uses the Network Services Interface to interact with the user in the
              event that manual resolution tasks need to be performed.  The work will be
              beneficial to the collaboration community beyond that of the Access Grid.  The
              proposal also includes technical guidance, training and evaluation of the
              Access Grid space and advice on changes and improvements at University of
              Chicago and the NSF Access nodes.
