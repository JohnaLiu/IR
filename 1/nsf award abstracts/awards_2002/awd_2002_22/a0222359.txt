NGS:  The Fourth Annual
              Workshop on Active Middleware Services (AMS 2002) and The Third Annual
              International Workshop on Grid Computing (Grid 2002)

The increasing
              complexity of the emerging ubiquitous grid network infrastructure in
              conjunction with active technologies requires additional support for
              application developers and users.  Middleware will play a crucial role in the
              degree to which active technologies achieve their full potential.  Such
              middleware will in all probability be deployed in grid environments.  For these
              reasons, two workshops are proposed:  one in active middleware and another in
              grid computing.  While these two workshops will be held separately, each will
              bring together leading researchers in their respective fields.  Research in
              related areas will be invited to add their expertise to the discussions.  While
              the main focus of each workshop in different, there is nonetheless a synergy
              between them.  Both could explore the advanced area of active grid
              middleware.
