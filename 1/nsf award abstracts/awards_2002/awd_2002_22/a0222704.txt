Abstract    :
              Crownpoint Institute of Technology seeks to broaden the current curriculum with
              increased emphasis on the quality of its instructional and outreach programs in
              STEM.  The outcome of the project will be a comprehensive study and potential
              impact assessment of how increased investment in STEM can attract more Navajo
              students into these fields of study, identification of professional needs of
              faculty, as well as how these actions will potentially effect the economic
              status and quality of life of the peoples of the Navajo Nation.

The primary
              goals of the project are to increase STEM resources to allow faculty to
              encourage and mentor students in scientific study and research, and to develop
              avenues for students to return to their homelands and help their own people,
              thus completing the circle of their journey.
