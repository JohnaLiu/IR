Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative project involving University of Illinois at
              Urbana-Champaign and Boston University.  The project will build, deploy, test
              and package a middleware-oriented distributed account management system.  The
              system supports the information exchange between grid-enabled systems that are
              necessary to implement distributed account management, resource allocation,
              usage accounting, and monitoring functions in a heterogeneous grid environment.
               The system will be coupled to the a grid transactions system to form a
              completely operational, grid-enabled reference implementation.  

The ability
              to manage user accounts, provide access control over its resources, manage
              allocations and generate usage reports in a distributed fashion is critical to
              the expansion of the grid.  The proposed system can be used to build a highly
              automated, scalable account management system that will work across disparate
              computing systems. The software will be packaged as an open-source distribution
              for further development and adaptation by the grid community.
