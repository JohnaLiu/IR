Proposal Title: MARS: Test
              Bed for a High-Power, High-Bandwidth, Regional Cabled Observatory

Project
              Summary
	The PIs propose to complete the design and then install an advanced
              cabled observatory in Monterey Bay that will serve as the engineering testbed
              for a future cabled ocean observatory. The Monterey Accelerated Research System
              (MARS) cabled observatory would provide remote, continuous, long-term,
              high-power, large-bandwidth infrastructure for multidisciplinary, in situ
              exploration, observation, and experimentation in the deep sea using cutting
              edge power and communication technologies. MARS will be located in Monterey Bay
              offshore the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) and will include
              one science node on 62 km of submarine cable with expansion capability for more
              nodes in the future. It is proposed that the science node will provide 4
              science ports, and each port will have a 100-Mbit-per- second, bi-directional
              telemetry channel. The node will have the ability to deliver a total of 10 kW
              of power to the 4 ports. "Extension" cables can be plugged into any science
              port to provide power and communications up to 100 km away from the original
              node using the most cost effective deployment vehicle from several options
              including MBARI's ROVs, ships of opportunity, or UNOLS class I, II, III or IV
              fleet vessels. MARS will make use of the tools, techniques, and products
              developed over the last several decades for high reliability submarine
              telecommunication and military systems to ensure that this system can operate
              over a 30-year lifetime with minimal life-cycle costs.
