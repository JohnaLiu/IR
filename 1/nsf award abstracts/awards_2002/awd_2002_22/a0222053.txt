              ABSTRACT

OCE-0222053

Although the gross features of
              atmospheric dust transport and deposition to the ocean are well established,
              major uncertainties remain on the effective solubility of the iron in the dust
              entering the ocean and the effects of these deposition on the distribution and
              speciation of iron in the upper ocean.  A PI from the Bermuda Biological
              Station for Research and a PI from the University of Delaware will participate
              in two cruises to a site near BATS during summer months to obtain atmospheric
              and water column samples when dust inputs are at peak values.  Atmospheric
              samples (precipitation and mineral aerosols) will be analyzed for
              total-dissolvable Fe and Al, as well as readily-soluble Fe and Fe(II). 
              Seawater samples from the upper water column will be analyzed for
              total-dissolvable Fe and dissolved Fe and Fe(II) in the dissolved (<0.4 um)
              colloidal (0.4-0.03 um) and soluble (<0.03 um) phases.  Results from this work
              will be used to determine the effect of atmospheric depositions on the
              distribution, speciation and biological availability of iron in the upper
              ocean.
