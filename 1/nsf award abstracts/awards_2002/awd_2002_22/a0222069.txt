Abstract    :
              This project continues support to maintain and improve standby readiness to
              mount rapid and follow?up responses to a mid?ocean eruptive events along the
              mid?ocean ridge systems of the northeast Pacific. The project is composed of
              several cross?disciplinary components, including the geophysical interpretation
              of remotely detected seismic events, physical, geochemical and geomircobial
              oceanography, microbial diversity and community dynamics of event plumes, and
              geology, geochemistry and biological colonization of new seafloor lava
              flows.
