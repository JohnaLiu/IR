Abstract    :
              Spoilage and pathogenic bacteria affect the quality and safety of fresh produce
              such as strawberries and mushrooms.  The surfaces of these products can be
              naturally contaminated with molds such as Botrytis cinera and bacteria such as
              E. coli O157:H7.  For many years foods have been treated with antimicrobial
              agents however, packaging materials may also provide the same benefits using
              similar or different additives.  A packaging system that allows for slow
              release of an antimicrobial agent into the produce could significantly increase
              the shelf life and improve the safety of fresh produce.  The use of these
              packaging systems is not meant to be used as a substitute for good quality
              control standards.  It can, however serve as an additional protective measure
              to help ensure safe and high quality foods.
