Abstract    :
              The ACS Division of Polymer Chemistry is sponsoring a three-day meeting
              entitled, "Polymeric Nanomaterials," in Sonoma, California, during the period
              of November 17-20, 2002.  The organizers are A. D. English, B. L. Farmer, and
              R. A. Vaia.  The conference has an outstanding collection of speakers from the
              U.S., Europe and Japan and anticipates a total attendance of approximately 150
              people.  They expect that 25 of these attendees will be graduate students and
              post-doctoral associates.  Fees for the students have been discounted by 65%
              ($425 discount).  The PI's request support in the amount of $3,000, to
              partially offset the expenses associated with underwriting graduate students,
              post-doctoral associates and younger faculty.
