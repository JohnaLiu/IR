Abstract    :
              This award is to support research that will develop an aquaculture-based
              calibration of the M. edulis paleothermometer.  A secondary goal is the
              application of the calibrated paleothermometer to fossil M. edulis shells from
              coastal Maine.

The research team will design and develop aquaculture-based
              techniques for monitoring M. edulis growth in controlled water conditions. 
              They will then document vital effects due to different age/environmental
              conditions as well as those arising from different locations (Maine/Greenland).
               Finally age/location-specific transfer functions will be generated for
              temperate and polar regions.  

The broader impacts of this proposed research
              are that it will lead to a better understanding of an important
              paleothermometer.  Ultimately, better paleotemperature estimates lead to a
              better understanding of the climate system and our ability to hindcast 
              different climate states and forecast future climate change scenarios.
