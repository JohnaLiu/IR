Abstract    :
              Soil nitrogen (N) availability controls the decomposition of plant litter in two
              ways.
First, it affects the quality or relative decomposability of litter
              through effects on plant growth and allocation. Second, soil N availability may
              directly limit the activity of decomposers. Because the Carbon (C) to N ratio
              of litter is usually higher than that of bacteria and fungi, these decomposers
              must immobilize N from the soil solution in order to use C in plant litter for
              metabolic activity and growth. The objective of this study is to develop a
              mechanistic understanding of how interactions between soil available N and
              plant litter quality affect decomposition using a novel method for measuring
              total N immobilization and loss during decomposition. This study will also
              provide information about the effects of fire on decomposition in boreal
              forest. Understanding how decomposition is altered by fire is key to
              understanding how ecosystem C balance may change with the increased fire
              frequency and intensity that is associated with anthropogenically-driven
              climate change. Finally, the mechanistic approach of this research should be
              make its findings generally applicable to understanding controls over
              decomposition in other systems.
