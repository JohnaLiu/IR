Abstract    :
              This project examines the dynamics of the Open Source Software (OSS) movement, a
              genuine behavioral and technical puzzle with a far-reaching impact on the
              world's economy. The OSS community has developed a substantial portion of the
              infrastructure of the internet and has many outstanding technical achievements,
              without the benefit of traditional project management techniques,
              organizational structure, face to face interaction, and in most cases, without
              direct monetary compensation. We seek to understand the factors that predict
              developer retention and project success, and to model the growth of the OSS
              network over time in order to inform policy decisions regarding the OSS
              movement. We develop an organizational behavior/social psychological model of
              developer motivation and project effectiveness using a modification of Hackman
              & Oldham's job characteristics model and March's role identity construct, and
              use simulation, data mining, and agent-based modeling techniques to model how
              the OSS network develops over time.
