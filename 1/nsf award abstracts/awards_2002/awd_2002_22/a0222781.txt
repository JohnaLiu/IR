Abstract    :
              This workshop will investigate the research issues and future associated with
              the new field of ubiquitous computing, which is centered on a vision of a world
              populated by networks of cheap and easily accessible computing devices. Such a
              vision has generated a great deal of excitement as there is a potential for
              improving the quality of our everyday lives. However, the realization of such a
              vision requires the resolution of a number of difficult technological and
              social problems. One major challenge is the interdisciplinary nature of such an
              endeavor, which requires coordinated advances in many fields of computer
              science including network design, security, user interfaces, coordination and
              collaboration theories, privacy, agent technologies, and mobile computing
              hardware. This workshop will focus on 1) supporting technology areas, 2)
              promising application areas, 3) research issues, and 4) evaluation methods. The
              steering committee spans both relevant technology and application areas.
              Position papers will be invited before the workshop. Formal papers will be
              gathered into a book-length manuscript after the workshop.
