Abstract    :
              This project is an application of modern Bayesian hierarchical methods of
              statistical analysis to the problem of ocean state estimation.  The goal is to
              use this statistical technique to combine hydrographic data, dynamical
              constraints, and knowledge about the uncertainties in both observations and
              dynamical assumptions, to arrive at: (a) slowly varying maps of oceanic
              property fields on a selection of isopycnals in the North Atlantic, (b) an
              estimate of the probability distribution function for possible states of the
              North Atlantic circulation consistent with the available data.  The project
              unites statisticians and ocean scientists and provides training in
              interdisciplinary research for a graduate student and two post-doctoral
              researchers.
