Abstract    :
              This Faculty Early Career Development ( CAREER) project integrates research and
              educational initiatives focusing on micro- and nano-scale processing of
              biodegradable polymers using laser techniques for biomedical and bioMEMS
              applications.  Research focusing on laser micro- and nano-scale processing with
              parametric studies using both a UV excimer laser and a femtosecond laser to
              produce controlled micro-features on polymer surfaces will be addressed. 
              Biodegradable polymers hold immense promise as new materials for implantable
              biomedical micro-devices due to their biocompatibility and ability to naturally
              degrade and disappear in tissues over a desired period of time.  This
              degradability eliminates a second surgery to retrieve the implanted
              micro-devices.  The CAREER project will:   (1) develop an advanced laser
              technique with a near-field beam delivery system to produce controlled micro-
              and nano-scale patterns on biodegradable polymer surfaces; (2) develop an
              experimental system and a numerical model to investigate the transient
              laser-material interaction process on extremely small time and length scales;
              and (3) implement the research into the development of biodegradable micro- and
              nano-devices.  This research will make significant contribution to the emerging
              and interdisciplinary field of micro- and nano-manufacturing science and
              technology, bioengineering, and polymer science.

The integrated education
              plan will focus on curriculum development in micro- and nano-manufacturing at
              the undergraduate and graduate levels by infusing emerging and
              multi-disciplinary research into the classroom. This plan also encourages women
              students in research and adopts cooperative learning techniques in teaching.
              The PI also incorporates a learning plan for himself in new methods of 
              educational pedagogy and curriculum development.
