Abstract    :
              Chief Dull Knife College, in collaboration with the University of Montana,
              Montana State University and Northern Cheyenne Reservation high schools, will
              implement a five-year TCUP project to develop a seamless pathway for students
              between reservation high schools, Chief Dull Knife College and the two partner
              universities. The project will enable team members from these institutions to
              work together and to establish long-term positive relationships and
              networks.

Project team members, including new faculty positions established
              through program funding, will work together to develop and revise high school
              and college math and science curricula; provide teacher training; develop
              capstone research and mentoring experiences; and implement a 2-week STEM
              workshop for high school students.
