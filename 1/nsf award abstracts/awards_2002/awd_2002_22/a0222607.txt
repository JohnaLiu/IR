Abstract    :
              This project is developing methods for studying the organic composition of
              clouds and fogs and the efficiency with which clouds and fogs scavenge
              carbonaceous aerosol particles.  The project includes a laboratory development
              effort to improve capabilities for measuring concentrations of the diverse
              organic species suspected to be present in cloud and fog drops and a series of
              field experiments to collect samples suitable for application of the developed
              suite of organic analytical techniques.  The field campaigns are being used to
              collect samples of cloud/fog types that are seasonally important in three
              distinct environments: winter radiation fogs in the California's Central
              Valley, spring stratus clouds intercepting the coastal hills of Southern
              California, and summer orographic clouds intercepting the western slope of the
              Rocky Mountains.
