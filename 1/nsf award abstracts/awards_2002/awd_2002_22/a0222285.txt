Abstract    :
              Funds are provided to process the data collected on two geophysical cruises in
              the Sea of Marmara. The PIs will combine the results from the collected chirp,
              sidescan, and bathymetric data with detailed sedimentology of piston cores and
              land-based observations to work out the configuration of the fault zone and to
              determine the history of paleoseismicity by correlating submarine landslides
              and turbidites to individual paloearthquakes. The work will have important
              societal relevance as it will lead to better understanding of the nature of
              deformation associated with the earthquakes and their history in the region.
