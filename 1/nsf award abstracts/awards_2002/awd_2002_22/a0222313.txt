Abstract    :
              It has recently been observed that the majority of precipitation in
              water-limited ecosystems comes in large, sporadic storm events and that these
              pulse events, rather than annual mean precipitation, may be the more
              significant manner by which to characterize precipitation. This workshop will
              examine the effects of pulse events in precipitation in arid and semi-arid
              environments at multiple biological scales. The timing, length and intensity of
              rainfall events is naturally variable in these ecosystems and is thought to
              govern the life history strategies of its inhabitants, population dynamics,
              community change, resilience to invasion, soil nutrient dynamics and ecosystem
              nutrient fluxes. As a consequence of global warming, precipitation patterns are
              expected to change in arid and semi-arid ecosystems worldwide. The purpose of
              this workshop is to convene a diverse group of international researchers in
              order to facilitate interregional and interdisciplinary exchange, data
              synthesis, theory development and training. The workshop will produce a review
              article targeted for a broadly read ecological journal along with website
              resources for researchers, educators and professionals.
