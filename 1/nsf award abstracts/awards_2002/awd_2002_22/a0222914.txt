Abstract    :
              In the last decade, computer systems have increasingly become participants in
              complex, distributed communities comprising people and computer systems, rather
              than devices used by individuals.  This major shift engenders a significant
              challenge for computer science: to determine ways to construct computer systems
              able to act effectively as team members. Although many current computer systems
              have sophisticated capabilities as individual actors, most lack capabilities
              required for working successfully as members of a collaborative group.  This
              proposal addresses problems central to this challenge.  It focuses on providing
              the foundation for the design of decision-making components of software agents
              that can handle multi-agent, dynamic team contexts. The proposed research
              comprises three activities: (1) empirical investigations, including examination
              of the influence on individual and group behavior and outcomes of policies and
              mechanisms for producing appropriately helpful behavior in collaborative
              settings and for governing commitment to group activities; (2) development of
              formal theories that may be used to address abstractly questions of these
              mechanisms; and (3) construction of more sophisticated
collaboration-capable
              software agents. The research will contribute to the development of
              collaboration-capable software agents and collaborative human-computer
              interface systems, and
thus will significantly increase the effectiveness of
              heterogeneous teams of people and software-systems agents.
