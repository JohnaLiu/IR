This small grant for exploratory research will enable
              preliminary research for a historical ethnography of tuberculosis among Alaska
              Natives from 1930-1990. Extensive consultations with Alaska Native communities
              and organizations will be conducted in accordance with the "Principles of the
              Conduct of Research in the Arctic". The principles include ethical
              responsibilities toward people and their communities.
