Abstract    :
              C-RUI: Forever Wild, the Adirondack Uplands and Watershed Integrity

The
              purpose of this study is to determine how underlying physical factors (such as
              geology) and
forest land management practices interact to influence"watershed
              integrity" in the Adirondack
Uplands of nothern New York  State.  We will
              address the central question:  Does long-term forest preservation enhance
              watershed structure and function in Adirondack uplands?  The proposed activity
              will involve a multidisciplinary approach to study patterns in multiple
              variables in reference catchments (subjected to forest removal durning the past
              15 years) in the Adirondack Uplands.
Within reference and managed categories
              catchments will be selected along a gradient of surficial soil conditions from
              shallow/till soils to deep/outwash soils.  Comparison across watersheds will
              include hydrogeology, surficial geology, biogeochemistry, forest community, and
              aquatic community response variables.  Data analysis will include multivariate
              statistical methods to extract patterns across the landscape in response
              variables.
