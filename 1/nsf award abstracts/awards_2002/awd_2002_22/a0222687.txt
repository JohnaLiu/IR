Abstract    :
              The long range goal of this project is to develop a computational formalism,
              built on stochastic Petri nets (SPN) that will enable accurate and dynamic
              calculation of all system variables and their variances. In particular,
              computational models of two Escherichia coli genetic circuits (emergence and
              decay of heat shock transcription factor, s?32, upon heat shock, and
              cell-to-cell communication or "quorum sensing") will be constructed, validated,
              and combined, suggesting the incremental assembly of predictive models that
              will ultimately predict system-wide behavior. Quorum sensing is known to
              determine the virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (causative agent for cystic
              fibrosis), E. coli O157:H7 (Enterohemorrhagic E. coli), and Salmonella
              typhimurium (food poisoning). The focus is on the identification of signature
              genes that contribute to the synthesis and perception of autoinducer-2 (the
              signal molecule for quorum sensing), as well as the interplay between this
              circuit and the ?s32 circuit. By assembling combined circuits and by creating
              an optimization formalism that captures the stochastic variance, the Principal
              Investigators (PIs) will create an approach by which phenotype can be
              predicted, manipulated, and ultimately optimized. The specific optimization
              objective for the proposed work is to streamline the synthesis process of
              biologically active recombinant proteins in E. coli and it provides significant
              motivation for this work. It is expected that stochastic variance information
              is important in understanding these circuits. However, the approach is intended
              to evaluate this assertion at each stage of the work.
