The applicants propose to develop a novel dual-FRET molecular
              beacons methodology for the  detection of cancer cells with high  specificity, 
              sensitivity  and  efficiency.  Molecular beacons (MBs) are single-stranded
              oligonucleotides with a stem-loop hairpin structure and dual-labeled with a
              fluorophore at one end and a quencher at the other. Delivering MBs into cells
              will result in a fluorescence signal if the MBs hybridize to target mRNAs.
              Thus, when the target mRNAs correspond to the molecular markers of a cancer,
              cancer cells (bright) can be distinguished from normal cells (dark ).
