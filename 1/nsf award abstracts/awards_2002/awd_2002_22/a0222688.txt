Abstract    :
              This action funds a 3-year continuing grant to the National Academy of Sciences
              to coordinate the U.S. National Committees for 5 scientific unions thus
              ensuring effective U.S. participation and leadership in the international
              bioscience community.  The unions are the International Union of Biochemistry
              and Molecular Biology, the International Union of Biological Sciences, the
              International Union of Pure and Applied Biophysics, the International Union of
              Microbiological Sciences, and the International Union of Physiological
              Sciences.  Also supported is DIVERSITAS, an international program of
              biodiversity science.  While each National Committee undertakes unique
              activities, they have a common mission to advance global access to scientific
              knowledge and research resources and to foster networks and communication
              worldwide.
