Abstract    :
              This project is to develop a wireless dense sensor array based on PVDF sensors
              currently under development for identifying and monitoring the localized damage
              of infrastructure.  The tasks involved in this project are:

1.	New PVDF
              sensors development; the sensor will be installed in the model structure to
              form a dense sensor array for monitoring the damages of the
              structure.
2.	Develop the smart sensor array by conducting the parallel
              vibration tests of two identical models structures on the shake-table, making
              different types and degrees of damages on one model, and leaving the other
              intact.
3.	Develop the smart wireless sensor array: the TCP/IP based data
              telemetry will be developed in the project.  The sensor array will be divided
              into modules consisting of differently distributed sensors used for monitoring
              the different members of structure.  Each module is connected to a programmed
              microprocessor.  The signals of "Warning", "Danger-low", "Danger",
              "Danger-high" or "Failure" identified in the sensor modules are transmitted
              wirelessly via the TC/IP data telemetry to the maintenance central office
