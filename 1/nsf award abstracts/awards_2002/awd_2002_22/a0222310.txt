Abstract    :
              This CAREER grant seeks funding for a systematic research program aimed at
              investigating the root causes of the underachievement of African American
              students in science.  An important part of this project will be to use the
              research findings to propose and field test classroom intervention programs
              aimed at enabling teachers to help African American Students improvement their
              achievement.

The work builds on that of Ogbu who has written extensively on
              the question of academic performance of minority students in American schools. 
              A specific research question is how the performance of these students in
              science is affected by their language use.  Both quantitative and qualitative
              research methods will be used.  Individual students and teachers as well as
              classrooms will be used as units of analysis
