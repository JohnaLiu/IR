Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
              develop an Ultra-Violet (UV) water remediation process using a novel Surface
              Discharge Pulsed UV lamp (SD lamp) to treat organic contaminants. The objective
              of the Phase II research is to extend Phase I accomplishments and to develop a
              prototype Surface Discharge UV water treatment system for subsequent
              commercialization. For UV water treatment, the SD lamp offers advantages in
              terms of inherent UV efficiency, spectrum, high intensity and the absence of
              concerns linked to the use of mercury.  Prior Phase I studies have shown that
              the effectiveness of SD lamps is greater than  that of commercial mercury lamps
              by more than what would be expected based on UV efficiency alone. The proposed
              NSF Phase II Project  will examine the reasons for this high effectiveness and
              to use this information in order to develop a Phase II prototype SD UV water
              remediation
system. This Phase II work will be carried out in conjunction with
              a major UV water treatment company.

The commercial application of this
              project will be in the area of water treatment. The Surface Discharge UV lamp
              is expected to replace mercury lamps currently used in most UV water treatment
              systems.
