The rapidly
              evolving global information infrastructure includes broadband wireless
              communication as a key component.   Communication technology of the future will
              need to  operate at the data rates, at high carrier frequencies, in high
              mobility situations, and under high levels of co-channel interference,  all
              while maintaining reliable data transmission using small and inexpensive
              components.  The fundamental challenge for future wireless technology stems
              from the harsh characteristics of the wireless propagation channel.
In
              specific, reflections from objects in the physical environment induce rapidly
              changing echo patterns which make it difficult for the receiver to recover the
              transmitted information without error.   Especially challenging are
              doubly-selective channels, i.e., channels which echo or blur the transmitted
              information significantly in both the time and frequency domains.   Since,
              these characteristics arise when high-rate information streams are propagated
              at high frequencies in highly mobile environments, the success of future
              wireless applications hinges on our ability to  communicate information
              reliably over the doubly-selective channel.

This research investigates
              practical signaling, detection, and estimation strategies for
              spectrally-efficient broadband data communication over doubly-selective
              wireless channels.  Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, known for its
              advantages in time-non-selective fading, is used as a starting point in the
              
study of practical data detection and channel estimation methods.  Extending
              these ideas, the investigators focus on non-orthogonal multicarrier signaling
              schemes which are specifically designed to optimize detection performance under
              receiver complexity constraints.
