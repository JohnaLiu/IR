Abstract    :
              This CAREER project represents an integrated research, instructional and
              outreach activity. The aim of the project is to gain fundamental understanding
              of "natural" quantum wires formed by lateral composition modulation (LCM)
              during molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth of InAs/GaSb superlattices,
              InxGa1-xSb single layers and InAs/InxGa1-xSb multilayers, where these materials
              may be utilized for applications such as nano- and opto-electronic devices.
              This research may significantly impact the development of solid-state
              technologies utilizing InAs/(In)GaSb LCM materials forming the basis for new
              LCM devices, such as lasers based on quantum wire (QWR) technology. An
              objective of the research plan is to control the formation of the LCM
              nanostructures, i.e., degree of modulation and modulation wavelength, and
              address re-producibility issues. This will be done through analysis using
              migration-enhanced epitaxy (MEE) to effectively control interfacial composition
              since LCM is associated with a surface undulation at the interface. Another
              objective is to structurally characterize the modulated structures by
              conventional and advanced x-ray diffraction techniques, i.e., in plane x-ray
              diffraction (XRD), grazing-incidence diffraction (GID) and grazing-incidence
              small-angle scattering (GISAXS). These techniques will allow probing of the LCM
              structures in terms of depth/interface analysis, not available through
              conventional XRD. Cross sectional transmission electron microscopy (XTEM) will
              also be used in conjunction with XRD to yield a survey of the physical
              structure of the LCM. A third objective is to characterize the optical and
              electrical behavior of these structures by polarization dependent
              photoluminescence and magneto-photoluminescence to demonstrate quantum wire
              behavior, and Hall effect measurements to determine the materials prospect for
              future nano- and opto-electronic device development. An established
              collaboration with the Naval Re-search Laboratory (NRL) on the growth of these
              materials will greatly enhance the success of the project and broaden and
              enrich the perspectives of students involved in the project beyond the confines
              of the PI's laboratory through summer internships.

The project
              addresses fundamental materials science research issues having technological
              relevance. An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on
              education, and the integration of research and education. The educational plan
              extends beyond usual graduate and under-graduate student activities via four
              avenues: (1) Development of a course based on experimental techniques in
              solid-state physics and its role in the future of nanotechnology targeted
              toward first and second year physics and engineering graduate students. This
              course will introduce experimental techniques of solid-state physics as they
              apply to nanotechnology as well as include laboratory visits and experimental
              demonstrations; (2) Advising undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral
              associates in the PI's laboratory will broaden their individual perspectives
              beyond that of a single specialty. These students will also assist with
              laboratory demonstrations for an experimental solid-state physics course being
              developed; (3) Mentoring and exposing undergraduate students involved in the
              Louis Stokes Minority Alliance Program (LSAMP), to solid-state nanotechnology
              through laboratory positions and laboratory tours as well as presenting
              lectures at the LSAMP annual conference and (4) Yearly lectures at local high
              schools on the impact of nanotechnology on society.
