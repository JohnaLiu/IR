Abstract    :
              Achieve, Inc. plans to work with a group of Mathematics Achievement Partnership
              (MAP) states to plan a set of challenging mathematics activities that includes
              a new mathematics assessment, professional development, and curriculum
              selection.  The strategic plans that are created will allow each state to
              assess the degree of alignment between existing states standards and tests, and
              MAP standards and assessment.

Achieve, Inc. has been actively working with
              states over the past several years to help states transition to more
              challenging mathematics curricula and assessment.  Through other funding
              sources, Achieve, Inc. is creating a extbook guide, professional development
              models and a website library of mathematics lessons.  It is anticipated that an
              assessment will be produced as well.

There are fourteen states that have
              been associated with the MAP effort.  This planning effort will provide a small
              number of MAP states with an opportunity to actively plan for a transition from
              current standards and assessment to a more ambitious and internationally
              benchmarker endeavor.
