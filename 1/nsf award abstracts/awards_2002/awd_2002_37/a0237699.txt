Abstract    :
              This project aims to enable multiple intelligent agents to learn to act both
              individually and in coordination with one another towards individual and/or
              common goals in real-time, noisy, collaborative and adversarial environments. 
              The approach taken will be to study complete agents in specific, complex
              environments, with the goal of drawing general lessons from the specific
              implementations. Fundamental research will be conducted in four main areas. 
              First, multiagent reinforcement learning will be scaled up to handle larger and
              more complex problems than has been previously possible.  Second, new state
              representations suitable for learning will be proposed and
tested.  Third,
              game theoretic approaches to improving agent performance by predicting the
              responses of other agents will be investigated.  Fourth, strategies for
              learning autonomous bidding
agents will be developed and tested.  Application
              domains will include: robotic soccer, both in simulation and with real robots;
              and autonomous bidding agents in multiple realistic scenarios.
The rich
              simulation environments to be used for this research are ideal substrates for
              teaching students about complete intelligent agents, including perception,
              cognition, and action.  The educational goals of this project include
              leveraging the appeal of these domains to students into challenging, exciting,
              and instructive undergraduate and graduate courses.
