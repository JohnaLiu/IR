Dr. Nancy Levenson is awarded a CAREER grant at the University of
              Kentucky for an integrated program of research and education to study the
              obscuration by dust and resulting reprocessing of energy in active galaxies,
              ultimately revealing the intrinsic accretion power of their central engines.  
              She and her students will observe nearby samples of obscured active galactic
              nuclei (AGN) with three specific objectives: (1) to measure the local physical
              conditions and distribution of material in the obscuring regions; (2) to
              identify reliable signatures of AGN, even when they are strongly obscured; and
              (3) to reveal the connection between circumnuclear starbursts and AGN. This
              work will use spectroscopy and imaging at X-ray and infrared energies,
              specifically considering the effects of strong obscuration and intense star
              formation, which can alter the net emission significantly. 

The related
              educational program will enhance the undergraduate astronomy concentration at
              the University of Kentucky, improve the education of non-scientists, and
              develop students' abilities through research. Dr. Levenson will increase the
              effectiveness of the astronomy concentration by creating an intermediate-level
              astrophysics course, increasing student involvement in research, and producing
              new publicity about the program. In teaching both science and non-science
              majors, she will apply effective pedagogies that emphasize active learning,
              such as collaborative learning, peer instruction, and assigned writing.
              Finally, Dr. Levenson will mentor undergraduate and graduate students,
              directing their work in the research program.
