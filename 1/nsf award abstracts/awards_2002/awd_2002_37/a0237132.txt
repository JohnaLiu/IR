Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99)  Physics (13)  The project is developing software to make
              it easy for scientists, engineers, and their students to create computer models
              of physical systems that include real-time, 3D, interactive graphics. The value
              of 3D computer visualization in science and engineering education and research
              is widely recognized.  3D modeling of molecules in chemistry and biology is
              perhaps the most widely used 3D tool, whose high utility has justified the
              expensive development of appropriate software. Many math packages generate 3D
              representations of functions. However, more general use of 3D visualization,
              coupled to the flexibility of a general-purpose programming language, has been
              blocked by great technical difficulties which require high computer skills to
              overcome. This is particularly limiting for educational applications.   Even in
              chemistry and biology where 3D tools exist, it is difficult or impossible for
              scientists to modify or extend these packages. These applications do not have
              the open-ended flexibility of a programming language. 

A new tool, VPython,
              makes it possible for many scientists and engineers, and students of science
              and engineering, to create 3D visualizations quickly and easily, coupled to the
              flexibility and power of a programming language. Moreover, these visualizations
              can be interactive in real time, transcending the limitations of a canned
              movie.  The project is bringing VPython to a mature level of open source
              development, so that thereafter it can be easily maintained and extended, as a
              contribution to the infrastructure of science and engineering research and
              education.
