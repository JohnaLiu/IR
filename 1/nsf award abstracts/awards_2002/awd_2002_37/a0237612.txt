Abstract    :
              In this CAREER project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of
              the Chemistry Division, Polenova will study vanadium-containing enzymes and
              associated model compounds using a variety of NMR techniques.  The NMR
              experiments will be interpreted using density matrix simulations of spectra,
              and the electric quadrupole gradients for the vanadium will be interpreted
              using parameterized electronic structure calculations.  These methods will be
              applied to haloperoxidases as well as to studies of vanadyl model compounds
              with known crystal structure.

Metal ions serve a number of purposes in
              proteins, including catalytic, storage, and structural functions.  Many of the
              mechanistic aspects behind these functions are not well understood.  The
              application of solid-state NMR to metal sites in proteins is an important
              application.  In this work Polenova is able to gather data about metal
              complexes with high sensitivity and high resolution.  These data should have an
              impact on understanding biologically relevant systems as well as helping
              advance the state of knowledge at the interface between spectroscopy,
              bioinorganic chemistry, and metallobiochemistry.  The results have the
              potential to help develop more environmentally friendly methods of catalysis. 
              In her research program Polenova involves not only graduate and undergraduate
              students, but she also performs outreach to high school students.  In addition,
              her education activities encourage underrepresented groups to pursue careers in
              science.
