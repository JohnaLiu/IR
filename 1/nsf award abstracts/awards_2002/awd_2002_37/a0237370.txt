Abstract    :
              Analysis and Design of Discontinuity-Driven Bifurcations

This award focuses
              on the analysis and design of nonsmooth dynamical
systems, characterized by
              abrupt and discontinuous changes in the
systems' properties, and commonly
              encountered in mechanical, biological,
and electronic models. Of particular
              significance are the potentially
dramatic changes in character and stability
              of motions of such systems
that occur at the onset of weak interactions with
              the environment, here
referred to as discontinuity-driven bifurcations. For
              example, in the
case of human gait, premature, low-velocity ground contact of
              the swing
foot may result in loss of stability of the sustained gait
              and
subsequent fall, particularly in individuals with muscular disorders
              or
the elderly.

The objectives of this project are to develop a
              comprehensive predictive
methodology for discontinuity-driven bifurcations of
              recurrent and
transient motions and to formulate design criteria for reducing
              or
eliminating the detrimental effects of unintentional collisions between
a
              mechanical subsystem and its surrounding environment -- in particular,
the
              prevention of fall-related injury due to premature ground contact
during gait.
              The research work will closely integrate with an effort to
develop a
              closed-ended-design course at the junior level emphasizing
performance
              verification tests for mechatronic systems and the
evaluation of a system's
              response in the presence of smooth and
discontinuity-driven bifurcations.
