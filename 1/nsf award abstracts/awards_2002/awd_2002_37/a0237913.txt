Abstract    :
              A surprisingly large number of safety tasks can be viewed as the detection of
              unusual events. This research will develop video analysis systems that can
              distinguish ``unusual'' from ``normal'' activities without specifying the
              unusual events ahead of time. This stands in contrast to most current systems
              which are designed to recognize special, pre-determined events. Three major
              thrusts of work will make the development of such video safety systems more
              realistic: (1)The PI will significantly increase the precision of parametric
              process models by including the event duration and the time of an event.
              (2)These complex models require more training data, yet only few data points
              will be available to estimate the time-dependent parameters. Therefore, this
              research will explore several different ways of estimating accurate models
              robustly from limited data. (3)Finally, this research will investigate how to
              use HMMs to detect deviations of the current time-series from the learned
              model. 

The theoretical work will be put to practice on a task that will
              increase the safety of independently living senior citizens.  The system will
              learn a model of the daily habits of the person based on video data from
              multiple cameras in the apartment. Emergency situations like strokes and falls
              can then be detected as deviations from the regular behavior, and a care taker
              can be notified. In the later stages of the project, the new models will also
              be applied to other safety and traffic tasks.

The education component of
              this award includes the development of extensive tutorials on stochastic
              modeling techniques which will be made available to the public online, as well
              as an interdisciplinary seminar on stochastic modeling at RPI.
