This research project, supported in
              the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focuses on the fundamental study
              of electrocatalysis and electrode modification.  Work carried out by Professor
              Gewirth and his colleagues at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign
              examines structure-reactivity correlations in the electroreduction of oxygen,
              peroxide, and nitrate species at underpotential deposition modified surfaces. A
              combination of scanning probe microscopy, surface x-ray methods, and
              vibrational spectroscopy methods are being used to investigate these systems. 
              In addition, the structure of novel adsorbed inorganic oxometallate monolayers
              are being probed.  This work provides fundamental insight into the mechanisms
              of electrocatalysis and electrode modification relevant to fuel cell and
              battery technologies. 

With the support of the Analytical and Surface
              Chemistry Program, Professor Gewirth and his group at the University of
              Illinois-Urbana Champaign are examining the structure and reactivity of metal
              and inorganic monolayer electrode surfaces.  Using a combination of
              spectrosocopic and microscopic methods, the structure and reactivity of metal
              modified electrodes are examined for a series of small molecule
              electroreduction reactions.  In addition, the structure of polyoxometallate
              monolayers is studied.  The results of this work help to develop an
              understanding of important fuel cell and energy storage technologies.
