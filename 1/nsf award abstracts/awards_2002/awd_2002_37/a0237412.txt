Abstract    :
              This is a 5-year continuing award.  This research effort will address the
              application of immersive virtual environments (VEs) to the architectural design
              and construction industries.  Specifically, it aims to make immersive design
              applications - those in which the designer can create or modify a 3D space
              while immersed within it - possible.  There are four components to this work. 
              First, the PI will design and evaluate user-centered 3D interaction techniques
              specially targeted at design and construction tasks.  He will then design and
              implement a high-level software framework that supports rapid prototyping and
              development of immersive design applications.  Next, he will develop several
              proof-of-concept VE applications using the domain-specific interaction
              techniques and implemented in the software framework.  Finally, the PI will
              educate students, both in HCI (through a new course and textbook on 3D
              interaction), and in the design disciplines (through the use in courses of the
              VE applications developed in this project).  This research will have a
              significant impact in the VE and 3D interaction communities, leading to an
              increased understanding of how interaction techniques can be tailored to
              particular tasks and domains.  The software framework will impact research in
              immersive design, allowing graphics and VE novices (domain experts) to build
              powerful interactive VE applications.  The example applications the PI builds
              will impact the design and construction industries, providing a tighter design
              cycle and an increased understanding of difficult 3D problems.  And there will
              also be a two-pronged impact in the classroom, where the PI will use VE
              technology as a learning tool in the design disciplines and introduce
              cutting-edge research in 3D interaction to graduate-level HCI students.
