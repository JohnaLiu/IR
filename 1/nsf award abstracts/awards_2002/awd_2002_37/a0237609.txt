Abstract    :
              The winter of 2001-02 in southern California was the driest year since
              instrumental records began in 1850. Southern California mountain conifer
              forests exhibit symptoms of severe drought stress, including elevated tree
              mortality, active insect predation, premature leaf shed, absence of leader
              growth in early summer, and anomalous leaf-shed in both evergreen and winter
              deciduous
broadleaf species. Drought is also coupled with wildland fire, which
              is integrated in the structure, species composition and distribution of
              southern California conifer forests. It follows that the rate of
              drought-induced tree mortality/dieback must be evaluated in relation to
              long-term fire regimes and vegetation dynamics. Because the region is now
              experiencing rare conditions of the climate, it is vital to document the state
              of the forests with an aerial photographic survey in September, 2002, using as
              a case study the San Bernardino Mountains and San Jacinto Mountains where water
              deficits are greatest. This research will use stereoscopic aerial photography
              at a scale of 1:24,000 to assess tree mortality patterns and compare them to
              1983 photos in hand. The photo resolution of <1.0 m will permit the analysis of
              trees as small as saplings, 3.0 m tall. The objective of this study is to
              document and quantify the spatial pattern of the current forest
              dieback/mortality episode in SBM and SJM to test the following hypotheses: (1)
              drought-induced fire mortality reflects fire regime and life history traits of
              ecosystems, and (2) drought mortality reflects the post-fire successional
              status of stands in the patch mosaic, including changes arising from fire
              suppression. The study is relevant to other research including air pollution
              effects on forests, fire suppression and forest densification, and short-term
              fire risk to suburban mountain communities.
