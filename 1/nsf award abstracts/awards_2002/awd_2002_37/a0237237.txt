Abstract    :
              This proposal is for partial support for a GSA Penrose conference on the topic
              of Tectonics, Climate and Landscape Evolution which is to be held in January,
              2003 at Taroko National Park in Taiwan (ROC). This proposal represents a
              request for funding for the PI and the other conveners to conduct a
              pre-conference trip to Taiwan in order to plan and scout fieldtrip stops and
              conference facilities. We are also requesting support to subsidize the
              participation of i)graduate students, ii) scientists who may have difficulty in
              obtaining funds to attend, and iii) the conference and fieldtrip organizers.
