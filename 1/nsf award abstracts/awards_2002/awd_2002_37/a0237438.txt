Abstract    :
              Dormant eggs of zooplankton accumulate in large numbers in lake sediments, where
              they can remain viable for centuries.  When eggs are removed from the lake and
              hatched, they provide a living link to past communities.  Dozens of lakes in
              Vermilion Co., Illinois were formed within the past century by strip-mining,
              and I will use these lakes to address questions regarding how different factors
              influence the persistence ability of populations, and consequently, the
              development of aquatic communities.  I will take sediment cores that extend to
              the formation of each lake.  This presents a unique opportunity to examine
              factors responsible for why populations become extinct, since the eggs
              contained within the core display the entire colonization history of
              zooplankton, and demonstrate patterns of species replacement through time. 
              Many of these dormant eggs can be hatched, allowing me to use multiple
              populations of Daphnia to investigate the relative importance of within
              population (genetic diversity, life-history variation) versus among population
              (competition, predation) processes in determining changes in species
              composition over time.  As part of the education component, I will produce a
              manual for elementary school teachers that will include activities for
              self-guided field trips of the lakes located a state park.
