Given the growing interest within the scientific community to
              use the Gulf of Alaska to study tectonic-climate interrelationships,  this
              award will support a workshop to develop a strong synergistic science plan. 
              The workshop will be jointly funded by the National Science Foundation
              (Continental Dynamics Program) and the Joint Oceanographic Institutions (JOI). 
              The workshop will bring together scientists representing the fields of
              tectonics and geodynamic modeling, terrestrial and marine observational
              geophysics, GPS-based geodesy, glaciology, marine geology and glaciomarine
              sedimentation, micropaleontology, palynology, paleomagnetics, paleoclimatology
              and paleo-oceanography.
