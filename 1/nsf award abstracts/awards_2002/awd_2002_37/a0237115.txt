This award supports Professor Mark Gordon and three graduate
              students from Iowa State University for travel to Canberra Australia to
              collaborate in computational quantum chemistry with faculty of the Australian
              National University. Their Australian hosts and collaborators are Professors
              Michael Collins and Leo Radom of the Research School of Chemistry and Professor
              Alistair Rendell of the Computer Science Department. Each of the Ph.D. students
              has distinct research interests and will work with a different host with
              similar interests. Ms. Netzloff will work with Professor Collins on the
              interface between electronic structure theory and dynamics. They will link the
              multi-reference structure code developed at Iowa State with the potential
              energy surface building program developed at ANU and applying the new combined
              capability to the study of the dynamics of important molecular systems.  Mr.
              Olson will work with Professor Rendell and members of the ANU Supercomputer
              Center on the development of high performance electronic structure codes,
              including scalable and graphics code for electronic structure theory. Ms.
              Rintelman will work with Professor Radom and his group on practical
              implementation of multi-reference methods on problems in surface chemistry and
              solvation.

This suite of research addresses methodological and theoretical
              problems at the cutting edge of quantum chemistry, where experimental data are
              extremely rare and difficult to obtain. The improved computational methods that
              result will enhance the power of quantum chemistry for addressing important
              technological and industrial problems.  The collaborative arrangements with
              three world-class scientists and their research groups at ANU provide
              outstanding international research opportunities for three U.S. graduate
              students, two of them women.
