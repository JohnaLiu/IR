Abstract    :
              Self-assembly is the process by which simple objects 
spontaneously assemble
              into complexes. 
It is expected to ultimately become 
an important technology
              at the level of atoms and
molecules.  The development of researches in
              programmable
self-assembly is reaching the stage that we have
to understand
              it mathematically in order
to take full advantage of this new tool.
The goal
              of this research is to study 
the computational aspects of self-assembly.
              

The objectives of this project includes: 
(1) Solving concrete problems in
              the Tile Assembly Model,
including but not limited to
finding an
              approximation algorithm for the Minimum
Tile Set Problem (MTSP)
and
              characterizing the shape languages.
(2) Exploring different modelings of
              self-assembly, which
will give a more accurate abstraction of 
the
              experimental results and will reflect the massive parallelism 
in
              molecular/DNA computing.
(3) Studying the connections between 
the
              algorithmic self-assembly and the classical theory
of computation, especially
              the communication theory
and the resource-bounded Kolmogorov
              complexity.

This CAREER project will integrate teaching activity 
into the
              research of self-assembly.
The PI will offer  graduate level courses in
              
molecular computing and closely-related fields such as 
bioinformatics, and
              introduce the research
to undergraduate and graduate students in general
              theory courses.
This project will adopt the active learning techniques in
              teaching.
It is expected that the project will contribute to
              understanding
the engineering power of self-assembly, and to
              disseminating
the current research information to students as well.
