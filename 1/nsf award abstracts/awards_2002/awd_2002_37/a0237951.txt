              ABSTRACT
CTS-0237951
F. Mashayek, Univ. of IL - Chicago

The focus of the
              revised proposal in on development of DNS and RANS methods for simulation of
              particle laden gas flow, dispersed two-phase flows.  The results will have
              broad applications to environmental combustion in turbulent flows with either
              solid powder or droplet sprays, and the plan is to include heat transfer and
              compressible flow effects in the simulations. This project will build on the
              recent work by the PI for LES models of turbulent two-phase flows and should
              provide engineering tools for the prediction of turbulent particulate flows
              that are more reliable than at present. 

A key element of the project is to
              use the probability density function (PDF) for particle phase space and to use
              the Louiville equation as the starting point for deriving the LES and RANS
              models.
