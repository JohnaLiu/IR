Abstract    :
              	
Computational comparison of biosequences is fundamental to modern biology. 
              It is the fastest, most widely used technology to annotate the functional
              elements of a newly sequenced genome.  Algorithms for comparison must address
              the rapid increase in the size of sequence databases and the need for more
              sensitive tools of multiple alignments, as well as the need to compare inferred
              feature models.  Enhancing the pattern-matching algorithms that form the heart
              of fast comparison tools is the focus of this research.  A research framework
              for rational pattern design and a technique for combining pattern matching with
              substitution score matrices will be incorporated.  Pattern matching generalizes
              the word-matching heuristics of alignment algorithms.  The choice of pattern
              can impact the search speed and sensitivity.  The improved search patterns will
              be specialized to particular feature types, such as coding sequence, or to
              groups of organisms.  Collaborations with popular search tool developers are
              established and will help integrate the new methods.  Research training
              involves students at many levels and will also form the basis of
              cross-disciplinary student exchanges.
