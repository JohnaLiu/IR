Abstract    :
              
The eastern flank of the Andes supports the richest flora and fauna in the
              world. Climate change and forest destruction threaten these habitats. Research
              will be undertaken to provide the first detailed information on the composition
              of modern forest communities on the Andean flank of southern Peru, and how
              those communities change along an elevational gradient (600 m to 3000 m
              elevation). Simultaneously, an investigation will be made at eight sites on
              that gradient to determine the changes of local forest communities since the
              peak of the last ice age. Fossil pollen and diatoms recovered from ancient lake
              sediment will provide a detailed record of how lake systems and local forests
              responded to past sudden climatic change, such as rapid cooling events within
              the last ice age, and the rapid warming associated with the start of the
              present interglacial. Information will be provided on how forest community
              diversity has changed through time, and whether changes in communities were
              restricted to just the rare species or affected all species equally. These data
              will help biologists understand how high diversity floras and faunas, with a
              high proportion of endemic species, can survive climate change, and what will
              be required to conserve them.
