Abstract    :
              The scope of a genome project includes the determination of the sequence,
              identification of gene, and annotation of the genome.  Each step involves a
              huge amount of data and is computationally difficult.  Often several separate
              computational environments are required.  To make the system more efficient and
              less likely to be dependent on personal expertise, a common, reconfigurable
              computational environment for a genome project will be developed. Four major
              components will provide a computational environment for prokaryotic genome
              projects.  These include:  toolkits for string matching and clustering; an
              ordering procedure for sets of assembled sequence; a platform for comparative
              alignment and annotation; an exploratory sequence analysis environment.  The
              work will provide a single unified computational environment from sequencing to
              annotation, alleviating the obstacles encountered at different stages of a
              project and contributing to faster, more accurate determination of assembled
              sequences and their annotations.  Educational activity will focus on developing
              a bioinformatics program, with participation in research projects throughout
              the institution.
