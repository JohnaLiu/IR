Stomata contain pores that regulate gas exchange through the
              shoot epidermis.  The control of stomatal formation is central to leaf
              development and plant productivity.  Stomata are produced and patterned via
              asymmetric divisions.  TOO MANY MOUTHS (TMM) is a leucine-rich repeat
              receptor-like protein that regulates stomatal number and distribution.  TMM is
              expressed in a population of stem cells during leaf development.  It appears to
              control the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation in a
              cell-type- and organ-specific manner.  TMM is also likely to receive spatial
              cues used to orient the plane of asymmetric division so that stomata do not
              form adjacent to each other.  Thus TMM probably functions at multiple levels of
              a developmental hierarchy.  Downstream signaling is likely to require
              association with other proteins because TMM lacks a cytoplasmic domain.  The
              TMM protein complex will be analyzed biochemically, and the identity and
              function of interacting proteins will be characterized.  The relationship
              between TMM and another gene with overlapping functions will be defined at the
              levels of genetics, expression, biochemistry, and development.  The expression
              pattern of TMM will be evaluated in the context of leaf and shoot development. 
              Asymmetric divisions will be studied to determine whether TMM orients an axis
              of polarity and how it controls the division plane.  This work addresses
              fundamental questions in plant development such as how a receptor regulates the
              plane and frequency of asymmetric division, and how cell position and
              communication contribute to pattern formation. Because other plants, including
              crops, have TMM-like genes, this work should provide a context for a wider
              understanding stomatal development and of the evolution of a key feature of
              land plants.
