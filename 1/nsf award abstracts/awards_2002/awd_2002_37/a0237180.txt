Abstract    :
              Professor Andrew Ewing of Pennsylvania State University is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to fabricate unilamellar liposomes to
              use as models for biological cells. The idea is to study fusion of the
              liposomes using advanced electrochemical methods in order to learn about fusion
              itself, and as a model for cell exocytosis. Microelectrode work as well as
              scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) using nanotube tips will be
              performed. Parameters to be examined include vesicle size, mode of fusion,
              membrane composition, pH and ionic strength and development of an artificial
              dense core with hydrogels. 

Exocytosis is a fundamental process underlying
              communication between cells, for example between neurons.  A better
              understanding of exocytosis could lead to improved models of brain function and
              treatment.  Fusion of vesicles is an important process in drug delivery.  There
              are applications of this work in microfluidics and possibly for biosensors as
              well.
