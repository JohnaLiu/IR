Abstract    :
              
The focus of this research involves the synthesis of polyfuran and co-polymers
              of polyfuran, pyrrole, and thiophene, doped with various concentrations of
              p-toluene sulfonate, trifluoromethyl sulfonate and perchlorate.  The thermal
              and mechanical stability as well as electrical conductivity of the polymers
              will then be characterized and compared to undoped counterparts.  The research
              will be carried out by undergraduates in order to help prepare them for
              graduate school and careers in science and engineering.

With this RUI award,
              the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of
              Dr. Rose M. McConnell of the Department of Natural Sciences at the University
              of Arkansas, Monticello.  Professor McConnell  will focus her work on
              developing methods for the synthesis of a series of doped polymers which will
              be investigated for interesting physical properties.  The research will be used
              to train undergraduate students in research skills not normally available in an
              undergraduate institution.
