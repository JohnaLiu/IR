Abstract    :
              When humans instruct each other h w to carry out particular tasks,nly a limited
              number of
tokenized (linguistic)instructions are used.In contrast to
              this,classic control theory speci .es
a control action to be carried out at
              each time instant.But,in a number f applications,such
as semi-autonomous
              service robots for industrial and domestic use,intelligent
              appliances,and
communication constrained embedded and/or teleoperated
              devices,the control procedures have
a natural,linguistic .avor.The
              interpretation here is that linguistic control instructions specify
particular
              modes f peration rather than explicit control values.
The verall objective f
              this CAREER-prop sal is t develop and disseminate rational meth-
ds for
              understanding how continuous devices,such as mobile rob ts,should be controlled
              using
computer generated,linguistic inputs.In particular,it will be studied
              how these instructions
should be de .ned,selected,and coded in rder to
              minimize the number of bits transmitted from
the computer t the rob t,while
              guaranteeing that the system meets its speci .cations.F r this,
an information
              theoretic approach t control theory will be developed,serving as a useful
              tool
not nly for source coding of control signals,but also for describing how
              symb lic instructions
should be interpreted and perated n by the continuous
              systems.Questions concerning what
sensors and actuators to use in a given rob
              tic application can be addressed quite elegantly
within this framew rk as
              well.
The development of this program will serve as a foundation for a
              teaching and research career
in electrical and computer engineering,with
              particular emphasis n control theory and rob tics.
In particular,the e .ort
              will be focused n the following key areas:
Hybrid Models: Control theoretic
              models will be developed for bridging the gap between the
continuous (the
              device dynamics)and the discrete (the linguistic control inputs).The
              proposed
models will give the symbolic inputs a clear,control theoretic
              interpretation,at the same time
as the expressive p wers of di .erent sets f
              control inputs can be made explicit.
Complexity Measures and Coding Theory: A
              complexity measure,corresp nding to the
number of bits needed for c ding a
              particular control procedure,will be proposed.Furthermore,
by establishing
              probability distributions ver the set f control modes,optimal c ding
              algorithms
can be derived.
Multi-Modal and Multi-Agent Control Design:
              Strings of appropriate control modes will
be constructed that make the systems
              meet given speci .cations while keeping the descriptions
short.F r this we
              will design control laws that use the available sensory data in an e
              .cient
way.These results will be extended t multi-agent control where
              formation maintenance and
obstacle avoidance should be achieved while
              minimizing the inter-agent communications.
Educational Plan: Due t the
              multidisciplinary nature f the proposed w rk,the under-
graduate control
              curriculum will be modi .ed and tw senior level undergraduate courses will
be
              included in the curriculum at the Georgia Institute of Technology.A multi-agent
              rob tic
testbed where b th human and computer generated inputs can be used as
              a basis for the motion
control will furthermore be developed.
