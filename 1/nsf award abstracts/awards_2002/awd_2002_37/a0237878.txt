Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is the automated reconstruction of highly accurate
              photorealistic descriptions of large-scale 3D scenes with a minimum of human
              interaction and increased computational efficiency. Recent developments in
              laser-range sensing technology make possible the acquisition of accurate 3D
              scans of large-scale scenes. Dense and complex 3D range data-sets along with
              high resolution color imagery (ground and aerial-based) will be utilized.
              Research will be carried in the areas of range segmentation (in order to handle
              the geometric complexity), automatic registration between range and 2D images,
              3D modeling, fusion of aerial photography, and visualization.  The proposed
              research is going to directly affect applications in the areas of urban
              planning, urban design, disaster prevention, electronic journalism,
              architecture, archeology, historical preservation, and entertainment.  The
              novel solutions that will be developed will have a direct effect on the
              educational agenda of the PI and on his outreach activities.  The
              cross-fertilization between Computer Science, Geography, and Film and Media
              departments is another priority. Finally, collaboration with institutions such
              as museums, and with companies concentrated on 3D site modeling and site
              construction is an essential step for forwarding this research out of the
              academic environment.
