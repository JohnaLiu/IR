Abstract    :
              The goal of this grant is to study the coevolution between the plant genus
              Bursera and its herbivores, the beetle genus Blepharida. These are highly
              diverse, tropical groups with spectacular adaptations and counteradaptations.
              In Bursera, resin is stored in canals that run throughout the leaves. In some
              species, the resins are pressurized and when leaves are damaged, an abundant
              release of resins is triggered. Besides being toxic, resin solidifies when
              exposed to air and may entomb small insects completely. Yet some Blepharida
              species can neutralize Bursera's resin defense by severing the leaf veins to
              stop the flow of resins before feeding on the leaves. Using DNA-based family
              trees of insects and plants, I will investigate the role of plant defenses in
              directing evolutionary host shifts by Blepharida. I will also determine the
              historical correlations of Bursera's defenses with the insect counterdefenses,
              and the time when they originated. This grant also seeks to help expand the
              undergraduate and graduate basic science curriculum in the Department of
              Entomology at the University of Arizona, through the developing of courses in
              insect and plant biology and to help undergraduates develop their teaching
              skills by training them in teaching natural history in the field and lab.
