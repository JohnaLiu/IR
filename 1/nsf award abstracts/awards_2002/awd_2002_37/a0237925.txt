Abstract    :
              In the past decade, exciting new mathematics and resulting putative experiments
              have been proposed that involve quantum mechanics in an essential manner. A
              recent technological advance is the development of laser and pulse shaping
              techniques. These techniques make it possible to control processes at the
              atomic level, where the dynamics evolve according to the laws of quantum
              mechanics.

The main objective of this project is a general methodology for
              the control of quantum mechanical system. The theory developed will have
              significant impact on promising applications of quantum mechanics. For example,
              it will render possible the implementation of quantum information processing
              for efficient computation and communication, it will shape chemical reactions
              in order to achieve a desired outcome and it will aid the storage and retrieval
              of information in memories that approach the molecular size. Apart from control
              theoretic aspects, this investigation will shed light on aspects of the quantum
              theory that are still not fully understood. These include the nature of the
              entanglement with other quantum systems and with the environment, the
              characterization of quantum versus classical dynamics and the limits and power
              of quantum computation.
