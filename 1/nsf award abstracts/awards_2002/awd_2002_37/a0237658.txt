Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to develop an efficient general strategy for the
              asymmetric synthesis of pyranoid functionality found in numerous natural
              products.  Malonate-derived anions will be added to chiral auxiliaries to
              produce unsaturated lactones common to several important antibiotics, including
              callystatin and leptomycin.  Palladium catalyzed coupling will be explored to
              couple the lactone subunits.  The methodology will also be applied to
              hennoxazole A, an antiviral marine natural product.  

With this RUI award,
              the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and
              educational efforts of Dr. Thomas T. Smith of the Department of Chemistry at
              Williams College.  Professor Smith will focus his work on the construction of
              important anti-viral and anti-biotic substances.  The educational activities of
              the award will include teaching the art of organic synthesis to undergraduate
              students at Williams College.
