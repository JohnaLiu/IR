Abstract    :
              0237479  Burd  The proposal addresses the role that nano-scale colloids play in
              the transport of trace metals and pollutants in natural environmental and 
              engineered systems.
The combination of experimental studies encompassing
              microscopic methods (AFM and EM), synchrotron-based methods (SAXS, XAS), and
              multi-scale modeling will aid in elucidating the significance of particulate
              material in aquatic systems.
This project is collaborative and
              multi-disciplinary, combining expertise from chemistry, biology, and modeling
              to investigate the role of fibrils and macromolecules in inorganic colloid
              aggregation.  Results of this work should help in the understanding the
              self-cleansing capacity of fresh, estuarine and marine waters through transport
              and sedimentation.  Of special interest is the understanding of the
              similarities and differences between freshwater and seawater.
This proposal
              was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Initiative,
              NSF 01-157, category NIRT.
