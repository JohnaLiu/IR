Abstract    :
              The overall objectives of this project are to (1) create more effective
              pedagogical agents by incorporating novel methods of figure animation into
              them, and (2) rigorously assess the performance of these agents in K-12
              classrooms.  The research is divided into two components. The first component
              will develop and integrate a system for stylistically variable low-level motion
              specification, both full-bodied and facial, into the high-level cognitive
              components of a pedagogical agent.  The particular pedagogical agent that will
              serve as the research infrastructure is called a ``teachable agent.''  The
              second component of the research will deploy the system in K-12 classrooms as
              each stage is developed, and conduct controlled multi-method studies to assess
              the influence of the animated agent on learning-related outcomes. The
              significance of the proposed work is its potential to improve the education of
              children, particularly in the domain of science.  Additionally, controlled
              studies on the value of animated pedagogical agents in the area of K-12
              education are rare. These studies should further the scientific understanding
              of the components
of compelling animation, and result in a broader
              understanding of the proper role of graphics and animation in learning systems.
              An interdisciplinary course in computer science and education is being
              co-developed for the web and will be co-taught with faculty from the field of
              education. Finally, by introducing education as an important application of
              graphics and animation, the plan is to broaden the appeal of computer science
              to those who are traditionally under-represented.
