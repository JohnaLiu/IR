Abstract    :
              Today, high-performance clusters of shared-memory multiprocessors (SMPs)
are
              employed to cope with large data sets for scientific
applications. On these
              SMPs, hybrid programming models combing
message passing and shared memory are
              often less efficient than pure
message passing although the former fits SMP
              architectures more
closely.

The objective of this work is to determine the
              sources of
inefficiencies in utilizing memory hierarchies of SMPs and to
              optimize
memory behavior. The novelty lies in the reliance on
dynamic binary
              rewriting, i.e., performance analysis and tuning are
performed on the
              application while it executes.

The technical challenges are to

1) develop
              a framework for dynamic binary rewriting,
2) determine coherence traffic
              resulting in misses for
non-deterministic orders of executions in the presence
              of parallelism,
3) identify memory bottlenecks,
4) determine data
              dependencies between data references for
hot-spots for binaries,
5) study the
              potential for memory-improving program transformations
on the executing binary
              and
6) evaluate the merits of optimizations for large-scale benchmarks
among
              others.

The key intellectual merit is in providing additional,
              dynamic
optimizations for long-running applications.  The broader impact
              of
this work lies in its contribution to counter the increasing gap
between
              processor and main memory speeds by fully
exploiting software
              optimizations.
