Abstract    :
              The National Academy of Sciences, Center for Education through the Board on
              Testing and Assessment, will convene a committee to conduct a series of
              activities over the next two years that will: (1) provide guidance to states on
              designing and developing quality science assessments in light of requirements
              of the No Child Left Behind Legislation; (2) foster communication and
              collaboration between the NRC Committee and key stakeholders in states and
              school districts so that the guidance provided is practical and useable.  The
              Committee's report will be widely disseminated.
