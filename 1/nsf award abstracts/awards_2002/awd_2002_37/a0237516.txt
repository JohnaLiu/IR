Abstract    :
              It is proposed to develop a new framework for the distributed processing of
              images from networks of literally hundreds of cameras, for which no calibration
              is known in advance and in which cameras may freely appear, disappear, and move
              about.  Conventional computer vision methods are not adequate for such
              networks, because they assume a small, fixed number of stationary cameras that
              can be centrally, simultaneously processed.  We will study distributed
              solutions for both calibration (computing absolute and relative camera
              positions) and computer vision problems (such as view synthesis) in large
              dynamic camera networks.

This research has broader impacts in the design and
              effectiveness of the camera networks that will be ubiquitous in the city
              streets, airports, and battlefields of the 21st century.  Such networks will be
              crucial for automatically monitoring and extracting information from
              environments where the safety and security of human lives are at stake.  Our
              goal is to develop the models, algorithms, and applications that will form the
              foundations of the new field of dynamic camera networks.
