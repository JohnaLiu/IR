Abstract    :
              0237750  Schnoor  This proposal is for a joint workshop on mathematical models
              for the management of  water quality problems in the United States and Europe. 
              The workshop will be held in Venice and the US delegation will be led by
              Professor Gerald Schnoor.  The Italian coordinator is Professor Marcello
              Benedini. This workshop collaboration will advance the state-of-the-art as well
              as provide some practical solutions for modeling water quality problems such as
              eutrophication, ecosystem habitat suitability, and hypoxia.
