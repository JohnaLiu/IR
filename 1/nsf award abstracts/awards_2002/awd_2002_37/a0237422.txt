The unifying research and
              education theme of this project is improving the reliability of software by
              cost-effective automated reasoning techniques and tools. The project
              concentrates on extended
static checking (ESC), a powerful form of static
              checking aimed at detecting insidious run-time errors such as
              null-dereferencing and out-of-bounds errors. Because of its limited goal of
              just uncovering
as many run-time errors as possible, ESC is easier to automate
              effectively than full software verification. However, its wide adoption is
              presently hindered by the low speed of existing checkers.

The overall
              research objective of this project is to develop new automated reasoning
              techniques and tools for ESC, with the expectation that they will make ESC an
              attractive and cost-effective technology for software development. Routine use
              of ESC will help uncover more errors during the debugging phase of the software
              life cycle, leading to a more reliable final product.

The overall education
              objective of the project is to expose students to specification/verification
              techniques and tools that have proved effective with real-word problems. A new
              generation of professionals
better prepared and predisposed to the use of
              these tools will facilitate their adoption by the software industry, making it
              possible for our society to reap the benefits of more reliable software.
