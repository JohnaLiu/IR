Abstract    :
              This project responds to a request to manage the NSF 2003 Nanomanufacturing and
              Processing Workshop, to be held January 5-6, 2003 in Birmingham, AL.   Basic
              discoveries and innovations in manufacturing methods and processes will be
              needed to achieve the full impact of nanotechnogy.  To move forward on this
              multidisciplinary issue of national importance, fifteen  experts in
              nanomanufacturing will be invited  for this 1.5 day workshop.  These experts
              will provide input on research needs for the future.  The workshop will be held
              immediately before the 2003 NSF Design, Service, and Manufacturing Grantees and
              Research Conference, so in addition to reporting the workshop results by
              publications, they will be immediately reported to the research community at
              the conference.  

Basic discoveries and innovations in manufacturing methods
              and processes will be needed to achieve the full impact of nano-technology. 
              The multi-disciplinary experts from industry, small business and academia
              gathered for this workshop will advise NSF on research needs for the
              future.
