Abstract    :
              This research especially focuses on homopalladium and bimetallic Pd-Ni, Pd-Pt,
              Pd-M (where M is Cu, Ag, Au), and Pt-Au carbonyl clusters, because they are of
              potential technological importance as ideal precursors in the design of new
              materials with useful catalytic, electronic, magnetic, and/or optical behavior.
               A major goal is to devise preparative pathways under controlled conditions to
              produce new, nanosized metal clusters in reasonably good yields to enable
              physical/chemical studies.  Clusters under study include homopalladium ones
              with 35, 39, 52, 54, 59, 66, and 145 metal atoms in their cores and similarly
              large heterometallic ones with a number of other metals.  

Collaborations
              have been established to carry out particular state-of-the-art measurements and
              high-level theoretical calculations on a number of the unprecedented
              nanostructured materials, including comparative analyses of physical properties
              and electronic structures of these normally well-defined, homogeneous ligated
              clusters (of which at least several should possibly possess mesometallic
              behavior) with those of naked. and ligated nanoparticles of the same metals
              with narrow size distributions. 

This research capitalizes on synthetic
              breakthroughs to make new materials involving large nanoscaled metal complexes.
               The research has possible relevance to commercial catalysts widely used in
              many organic reactions.  Students will be trained in the synthesis and physical
              measurements of nanosized materials.
