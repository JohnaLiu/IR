Abstract    :
              A grant has been awarded to Dr. S. Boomer of Western Oregon University to
              identify, characterize, and monitor bacterial diversity at four long-term hot
              spring study sites in Yellowstone National Park.  This award funds a renewal of
              what is known as the Red Layer Microbial Observatory project, the overall goal
              of which is to discover novel hot spring bacteria and consortia, and to
              understand their patterns of distribution and diversification.  These studies
              will focus on Red/Green Nonsulfur microorganisms, a poorly understood ancient
              lineage of bacteria, and employ DNA sequence analysis and molecular population
              assessment techniques.  Site assessment will also include extensive geochemical
              monitoring, including a cooperative effort with collaborators at the Thermal
              Biology Institute (Montana State University).   This grant will also improve
              and support the maintenance of an on-line public database that integrates
              environmental and molecular data over time, allowing us to make correlations
              between environmental variation and observed genetic profiles of these
              microbial communities.  

Western Oregon University is a public institution
              that involves undergraduate students in research projects, both through
              research-based class and lab curricula as well as through intensive summer
              training experiences and workshops.  A new component of this project will
              include an extensive commitment to research-based pre-college education
              outreach and the development of workshops for training teachers in molecular
              biology.  During the first award period, this research project involved 83
              undergraduates and 65 pre-college participants.  Over the next five years, we
              anticipate this renewed project will impact twice as many undergraduates and
              three times the numbers of pre-college students, in addition to 35-50 teaching
              candidates per year.
