This award will support
              three annual conferences of the grantees and government partners of the Digital
              Government program, with expected attendance of 175 individuals per conference.
               Also supported will be the ongoing operation, maintenance and improvement of a
              digital government web sit at www.digitalgovernment.org.  These two activities
              are key in the development of a research community related to electronic
              government and governance.
