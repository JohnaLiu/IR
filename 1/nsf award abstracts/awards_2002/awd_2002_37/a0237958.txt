Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and
              validate the predictive capability industry needs to dramatically improve
              machined workpiece quality by controlling machining induced stresses while
              simultaneously reducing distortion in aerospace and automotive parts. The
              objective for Phase II will be to continue the development and verification of
              analysis tools for predicting residual stress and part distortion. The goal is
              to supply industry with a validated analytical tool to easily and economically
              predict and prevent part distortion-reducing costs due to testing trials, part
              scrap, and time-to-market, increasing product quality and
              competitiveness.

The commercial and broader impacts of this technology will
              be provide industry with the ability to predict and prevent part distortion due
              to machining induced residual stress. Current techniques, which rely upon
              testing, and experience are not sufficient technically nor are they cost
              effective. Aerospace parts (large, monolithic, thin-walled, and expensive) and
              critical automotive powertrain applications, which demand flat surfaces to
              maintain fuel efficiency, component life, and lower emissions, are typical
              examples. A significant impact will be to manufacturing costs, lower scrap
              material, higher productivity, lower time-to-market, and increased product
              quality and performance.
