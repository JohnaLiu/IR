Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for an international conference on seismogenic
              zone studies that are being done under the auspices of the NSF MARGINS program.
               The last workshop on this topic was held in 1997.  Since that time a number of
              studies have been conducted that have developed new and important information
              on the factors that influence the distribution, timing, magnitude, and
              mechanisms for earthquakes.  The purpose of the workshop will be to foster
              exchange of information and results between researchers and students and
              provide a venue for developing plans for cross-disciplinary work in the future.
