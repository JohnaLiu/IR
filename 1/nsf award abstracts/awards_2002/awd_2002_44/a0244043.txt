Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for the renewal of a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates Site in Minority Group Demography at the University of Texas at
              Austin. The Sociology Department and the interdisciplinary Population Research
              Center will host the REU.  For ten weeks each summer, eight students will be
              exposed to demography via course work, seminars, and hands-on research
              apprenticeships with faculty. In addition, they will write scholarly papers,
              present their work in colloquia and conferences, and participate in
              professionalization workshops. Students may be affiliated with projects ranging
              from race/ethnic infant mortality differentials, to the experiences of women of
              color in the labor market, to the performance differentials among college
              students by ascribed statuses like ethnicity and gender. An Ethics seminar will
              introduce professional ethics as an explicit part of the curriculum and
              professional socialization efforts. 

This award contributes to the
              Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in
              science through active undergraduate research experiences.
