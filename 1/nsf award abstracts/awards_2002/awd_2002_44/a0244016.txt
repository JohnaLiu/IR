Title:  REU Site in Information Technology at the
              Baskin School of Engineering

The Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship in
              Information Technology (SURF-IT) program provides an intensive and personalized
              summer program for 12 underrepresented (women and minority) and disadvantaged
              undergraduates. The students are drawn primarily from institutions that do not
              have strong, personalized research opportunities. SURF-IT is a 10-week summer
              program that includes research directly supervised by a faculty member in
              computer engineering, computer science, or electrical engineering. Students
              also have weekly meetings on graduate school preparation, research ethics, and
              research presentation, as well as field trips to local neighboring Silicon
              Valley research laboratories. The summer program concludes with
a research
              poster presentation by the SURF-IT students, coordinated with other
              undergraduate summer programs within the institution.  

The goal of the
              program is to promote diversity in engineering by assisting motivated students
              in obtaining graduate degrees to then become positive role models for future
              generations of college students throughout the nation. Thus after the summer
              program, the faculty maintains continuing contact with SURF-IT alumni to assist
              them in applying to and succeeding in graduate school, as well as in their
              eventual careers.
