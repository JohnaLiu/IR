Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for an REU Site in Sociology at the University of
              California, Los Angeles. Members of the Sociology Department, in collaboration
              with faculty from a variety of other disciplines on the campus, are currently
              involved in launching a large-scale research project concerning contemporary
              urban life in Los Angeles called LA Observed. The REU Site will focus on the
              training of undergraduate students to conduct ethnographic field research in
              one substantive area of that project: cultural activities around the city.
              Fifteen undergraduate students will participate in the eight-week program.
              Students will be recruited from the California State System and local
              California community colleges with a smaller number coming from the host
              institution. The goal of the Site is to attract a diversified pool of talented
              undergraduates, especially those from under-represented groups, who might not
              otherwise have the opportunity to participate in an intensive research
              environment. Students will work closely with faculty research supervisors in
              classroom activities for 8-10 hours per week, and will engage in independent
              fieldwork at their chosen site for an additional 10-15 hours per week. They
              will receive rigorous academic training that will quickly allow them to gain
              first-hand knowledge about the nature of sociological inquiry and analysis.
              Each student will produce a professional-quality final research paper. Students
              will thus have the opportunity to contribute to the success of the larger LA
              Observed project. 

This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing
              efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active
              undergraduate research experiences.
