The Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
              University for the summers of 2003-2005.  Mark R. Anderson is the site's
              program director. Ten students will carry out research with faculty and
              research groups in the chemistry department for ten weeks.  Student recruitment
              will focus on small colleges and underrepresented groups in Virginia and other
              Appalachian states.  The program will have a research focus on physical and
              physical-analytical chemistry.  It will emphasize undergraduate research
              projects that make extensive use of modern spectroscopic and analytic methods. 
              The students will participate in a nine-week lecture series. They will present
              their results at a mini-symposium at the conclusion of the program.
