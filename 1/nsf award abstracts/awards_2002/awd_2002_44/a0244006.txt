Abstract    :
              This project, submitted under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)
              program, will examine the impact of legal structures and institutions on
              federal district court decision making.  In particular, the investigator will
              examine proceedings in Pedreira v. Kentucky Baptist Homes in the Western
              District Court of Kentucky. This case presents the question of whether the use
              of religious organizations to provide welfare services creates a constitutional
              violation under the establishment clause.  Using material gleaned from ongoing
              court hearings and the parties' court filings, the investigator will test the
              impact of the legal structures and institutional arrangements on the policies
              expressed by the court. This research will advance the understanding of the
              influence of legal institutions on judicial decision making.  This is
              especially pertinent at the district court level given the variance in
              institutional structures found across districts.
