Abstract    :
              Professor Thomas Wenzel of Bates College is supported by the Analytical and
              Surface Chemistry program to continue work on combining macrocyclic hosts with
              lanthanide shift reagents to obtain chiral information about analytes using
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR). 

Determination of the unique
              absolute configurations of certain chemical compounds is extremely important
              for pharmaceutical and other biochemical industries.  While NMR is not
              inherently sensitive to the handedness of molecules, it can be used in this
              analytical application in combination with macrocycles that provide
              environments enabling the exact three dimensional structures to be determined. 
              In this project, undergraduate students receive training in synthesis and NMR
              methods on an industrially relevant topic.
