Abstract    :
              Symposium on dynamic failure and thin-film mechanics


The California
              Institute of Technology requests funding for a symposium
on "Dynamic Failure"
              and "Thin Film Mechanics," to be held January
16th-18th, 2003.  This symposium
              will assess the state-of-the-art in
research issues in these fields and their
              impact on engineering
applications.  The symposium will feature 25 invited
              speakers who are
established and emerging leaders in Mechanics, Materials
              Science and
Engineering, Mathematics, Applied Physics, Bioengineering,
              and
Geomechanics and will include minorities and women from
              academia,
industry and research laboratories. Presentations will occur in
              5-6
sessions, none in parallel, to facilitate close interaction
              of
participants.  The meeting will culminate in a panel discussion
              to
summarize the state-of-the-art in the field and identify
              research
opportunities.  The presentations and discussion summaries will
              be
collected in a bound volume of the Journal of the Mechanics and Physics
of
              Solids (JMPS).  JMPS editors have also allocated 375 pages in the
journal for
              material from this symposium.
