This award provides funding to the University of Kansas
              Center for Research for the establishment of a three-year Research Experience
              for Undergraduates (REU) Site for 13 students each year for research
              opportunities in chemical and petroleum engineering. Projects will be available
              in areas such as biomedical engineering; fuel cell technology; catalyst
              development; computer-aided molecular modeling and design; plasma deposition;
              and microchip fabrication. Students will be assigned individual projects and
              will interact with teams of faculty, graduate students, and professional staff.
              In addition to the research experience, students will participate in weekly
              seminars, oral presentations of interim results, written report preparation,
              and lectures on research methodology. Participants will be recruited from
              institutions nationwide, with special attention to recruiting students from
              institutions without extensive research programs and students from
              underrepresented groups. It is anticipated that this program will help
              encourage and direct American students to graduate school and careers in
              research.
