Abstract    :
              This proposal requests partial travel support for ten junior investigators to
              attend the Conference on Collective Motion in Nuclei Under Extreme Conditions
              (COMEX 1) to be held in Paris from June 10-13, 2003. COMEX 1 is the seventh
              conference of the Giant Resonance series as well as the
beginning of a new
              series that will provide the appropriate forum of discussion for the nuclear
              structure physics community. The conference will cover new experimental and
              theoretical developments in the study of collective excitations in unstable
              nuclei and in nuclei at high temperature or angular momentum.  The conference
              organizers have committed funds to cover the local costs for ten junior
              investigators from the U.S. The requested funds will support half the travel
              costs for ten students who would make important and valuable contributions to
              the conference, but who would not be able to participate without financial
              assistance.
