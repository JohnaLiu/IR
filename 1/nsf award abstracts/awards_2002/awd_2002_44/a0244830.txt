Abstract    :
              Professor Gang-Yu Liu of the University of California Davis is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry program to fabricate nanostructures that
              immobilize antibodies with designated positions while maintaining their
              bioreactivity.  Scanning probe tips are used to secure antigens followed by
              divalent binding of antibodies.  The structures are probed by scanning probe
              microscopy (SPM).  Can the assemblies trigger cell responses which mimic
              natural immune processes? 

These studies have the potential to open new
              avenues of study in bioanalytical and bioengineering areas.   The project also
              relates to the goals of miniaturizing electronics such as biosensors to
              molecular-size scale.  Students receive interdisciplinary training in
              electrochemistry and nanofabrication skills and benefit from close
              collaboration with a synthetic chemist and an immunologist.
