The
              objective of this proposal is to develop methodology for the separation of DNA
              by size on nanopatterned surfaces.  The separation mechanism is based on
              nanoscale dimension variations of an attractive potential within the plane of
              the surface.  This will be achieved by using controllable chemical patterning
              techniques to create a surface with a variable surface energy.  Nanoscale
              patterns on surfaces will be produced by using the process of self-assembly of
              block copolymers to form etching masks that will enable the production of
              patterned structures with feature sizes of 10 - 100 nm on silicon substrates. 
              The micelles are versatile in that they can act simultaneously as pattern,
              mask, and resist.  Preliminary work showed that this method of electrophoretic
              separation of DNA molecules has the potential to significantly increase the
              resolution of molecules by size.  The current hypothesis is that DNA surface
              contact friction is the primary factor determining mobility.  Measurements of
              diffusion constants and mobility will be performed as a function of molecular
              weight and ionic strength.  Since the proposed method of electrophoresis on a
              surface does not require any topological confinement of DNA molecules in the
              direction of separation, there are no limitations on the size of the molecules
              to be separated.  In terms of the broader impacts, this work could lead to more
              efficient methods for separating DNA by size, which is at the heart of genome
              mapping and sequencing.  Accurate genome mapping could lead to improved
              understanding and diagnosis of diseases.
