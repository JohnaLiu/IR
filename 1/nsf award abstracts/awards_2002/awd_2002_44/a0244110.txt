This award funds a five-year Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site at Boston University for 15 undergraduate students
              per year for research opportunities within the context of ongoing research
              programs in the Biomedical Engineering Department. Student participants will
              work on individual projects as members of research teams in the laboratories of
              participating research investigators. During the program, group sessions will
              be used to provide a forum for presentations and group discussions of topics
              intended to supplement the research experiences and encourage the interns to
              pursue graduate training in biomedical engineering. Session topics will include
              presentations on how to pursue independent research; the available options for
              graduate study in biomedical engineering; the myths and realities of research
              careers; and how to make oral and written presentations. The goal of the
              program is to provide stimulating and intellectually challenging hands-on
              opportunities in biomedical engineering research to undergraduates in a
              supportive environment. Students will be recruited from colleges and
              universities from around the country. Applications will be especially
              encouraged from students from population groups underrepresented in research
              fields in engineering.
