This project
              supports a collaborative effort of two Computer Science departments in two
              universities to establish an REU site in Pervasive and Mobile Computing.  The
              collaboration supports 16 undergraduate students per year at the two campuses
              who would not be otherwise exposed to research.  This Site builds on
              complementary expertise of the two institutions and on existing collaborative
              research projects in pervasive and mobile computing.  One university
              contributes expertise in wireless systems and in minority student education,
              and the other will contributes expertise in emergency reporting.  

The
              multi-university pervasive and mobile computing project is developing a system
              architecture for integrating information appliances such as PDA's and 3G mobile
              phones into first-responders' operations in emergency situations.  The goal of
              the research in which the undergraduates participate is to define not a
              particular 
system but a framework for public-sector mobile data systems based
              on empirical data derived from ongoing development of such systems.
