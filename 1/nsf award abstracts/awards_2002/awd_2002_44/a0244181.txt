The Chemistry
              Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at
              Colorado State University for the summers of 2003-2005.  Nancy E. Levinger is
              the program director and Ellen Fisher is the co-PI.  Eight students will carry
              out research with faculty and research groups in the chemistry department over
              a ten-week period.  Recruitment will be targeted at students with limited or no
              research opportunities at their own baccalaureate institutions.  Collaborative
              research opportunities will be undertaken with three minority serving partner
              institutions: Colorado State University, Fort Lewis College and New Mexico
              Highlands University.  Students will work on their choice of projects available
              from 23 potential faculty mentors in all areas of chemistry.  Many of the
              projects are interdisciplinary in nature.  The students will also participate
              in career skills activities: library resources, resume preparation, ethics,
              oral and poster presentations.  A capstone poster session will conclude the
              program.
