This award provides support to the South Dakota School of
              Mines and Technology for a three-year national and international Research
              Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site in collaboration with the Mongolian
              University of Science and Technology (MUS&T) for research in advanced materials
              and biochemical engineering. The goals of the REU site are to (1) provide ten
              undergraduates of chemical engineering or allied fields with a unique research
              opportunity; (2) provide American Indians, women, and other under-represented
              groups a working knowledge of research in chemical engineering as a career
              path; (3) provide an opportunity to gain research experience in an
              international setting; (4) enhance students' critical thinking and
              communication skills (including written, oral, listening, and audio/visual
              presentation skills); (5) increase the students' interest in graduate studies
              with a target of 30% of participants pursuing graduate degrees; (6) introduce
              students to the 'beyond the classroom' experience in a research setting; and
              (7) enhance the students' ability to think independently. At least 30% of the
              students will be recruited from Tribal, four-year, and community colleges and
              universities from the four surrounding states of Montana, Nebraska, North
              Dakota, and Wyoming, where research opportunities historically have been
              lacking.
