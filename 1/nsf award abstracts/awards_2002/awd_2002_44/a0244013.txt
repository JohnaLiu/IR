Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for an REU site at the University of Southern
              California's Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies. The academic focus of
              the program will be marine geobiology.
The program will support eight students
              each summer for three years. The students will spend ten weeks at USC
              conducting independent research projects under the supervision of various
              faculty members. Possible topics for student research include, but are not
              limited to, marine microbiology, ocean biogeochemistry, and the adaptation,
              evolution, and population dynamics for marine animals. Students will also
              participate in an orientation session held at the USC research facility on
              Catalina Island, a series of field trips, faculty seminars, and mini-symposia.
              The program will culminate with a public REU science symposium showcasing the
              student's research projects.
