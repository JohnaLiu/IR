Abstract    :
              This action is to support a reconnaissance survey of the September 9, 2002 Papua
              New Guinea earthquake and tsunami, with a team of US and PNG engineers and
              scientists.  The tsunami reportedly killed 2 people as opposed to the 1998 PNG
              tsunami that killed 2200.  The 2002 earthquake was a stronger earthquake with
              epicenter located at approximately the same relative distance off the most
              impacted coastline as compared to the 1998 event.  The question arises as to
              why the 2002 tsunami had a smaller impact than the 1998 event.  This is
              particularly important for the western coast of the United States where
              offshore earthquakes of similar magnitudes are possible.

The reconnaissance
              survey includes a significant public outreach component, with lectures and
              talks planned in numerous locales and schools in the affected areas.  In terms
              of technology transfer, the team will implement standard tsunami hazard
              mitigation numerical tools on servers at the University of Papua New Guinea, as
              well as field train PNG university students in tsunami field survey techniques.
               The team will also participate in local seminars discussing earthquake hazard
              mitigation in PNG.  The team will work entirely in PNG, and the budget will
              support both US and PNG scientists as participants.

The results of the
              survey will be available as a work in progress on the principal investigator's
              USC web site.
