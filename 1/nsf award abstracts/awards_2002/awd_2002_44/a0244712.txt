Abstract    :
              This award provides NSF support for a planning grant to help Delaware set
              priorities for the improvement
of its basic infrastructure in the life
              sciences.  The main planning activity will be an assessment of existing
              
strengths and weaknesses in research, education, and business development. 
              Partner institutions include the 
Delaware Biotechnology Institute, University
              of Delaware, Delaware Technical and community College, Delaware State
              University, and Wesley College.  The planning grant will enable Delaware to
              collect data, establish a state committee, and develop a process for selecting
              specific focus areas within the life sciences and biotechnology for future
              sustainable infrastructure improvements.
