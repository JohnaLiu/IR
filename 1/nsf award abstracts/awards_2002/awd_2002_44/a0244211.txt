Abstract    :
              The intent of this Workshop is to show how the Interagency Metabolic Engineering
              Working Group (MEWG) has benefited each of the participating Agencies.  An
              Agency representative will make a brief review of their Metabolic Engineering
              Highlights resulting from MEWG, and then introduce a Grantee from one of the
              four Grant competitions held by the Working Group.  

The Workshop is
              scheduled to be held at the National Science Foundation (NSF) on January 31,
              2003.   Information generated at this Workshop may be useful for planning
              purposes for MEWG and the Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology (BEB) Program
              in the Bioengineering and Environmental Systems (BES) Division of NSF. 
              Information from this Workshop will be distilled into a report for NSF and the
              MEWG.
