Abstract    :
              Oklahoma State University continues operating a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site.  The theme of the REU Site is Optical Materials,
              Lasers and their Application in Optical Sensing.  The Site is hosted by the
              Department of Physics and the Center for Sensors and Sensor Technologies at
              OSU.  Ten undergraduate students are recruited every year for a ten-week summer
              research experience.  Student research projects address optical,
              electro-optical, radiation-sensitive, biological and colloidal materials with
              present or potential applications in optical, laser and sensor systems.  In
              addition to participating in individual research projects, REU students attend
              research seminars and field trips to nearby industrial research
              facilities.

This REU Site is supported by the Department of Defense in
              partnership with the NSF REU program.
