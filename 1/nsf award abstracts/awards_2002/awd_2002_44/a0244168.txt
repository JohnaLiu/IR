Title:  REU Site - Research Experience for Undergraduate
              Students in Cybersecurity

This project establishes an REU site focusing on
              research experiences for undergraduate students in the area of cybersecurity
              and infrastructure protection.  The site is administered by faculty members and
              researchers from the Computer Science, Telecommunications, and ATLAS (Alliance
              for Technology Learning and Society) departments at the University of Colorado,
              Boulder, and Computer Information Sciences Department at the Florida A&M
              University, Tallahassee, FL.

The REU site involves 10 undergraduate students
              in cybersecurity-related research for
ten weeks during summer. The site has a
              specified evaluation plan.  The site addresses the current shortage of
              cybersecurity professionals. The project establishes mechanisms to increase the
              participation of underrepresented groups via collaboration and active
              interactions with minority institutions (Florida A&M University, Dillard
              University, and University of Houston-Downtown) and EPSCOR institutions
              (University of Nevada at Reno and University of Wyoming at Laramie).

This
              site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU
              program.
