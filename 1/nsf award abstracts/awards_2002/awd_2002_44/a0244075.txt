This award provides support to Louisiana Tech University to
              establish a three-year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site for 10
              students each year for research in the area of micro and nano engineering. The
              REU site is designed as a ten-week summer experience and will provide students
              with an understanding of micromanufacturing and nanotechnology for research in
              the interdisciplinary fields of biomedical engineering, trenchless
              technologies, and electromechanical engineering. Students will be recruited
              primarily from the region around Louisiana Tech University with a focus on
              students from colleges and universities that either do not currently have
              graduate programs in engineering or have limited masters programs in
              engineering. Student participants will be actively sought from Grambling State
              University, Southern University and A&M College, Prairie View A&M University,
              and Jackson State University. This REU Site is supported by the Department of
              Defense in partnership with the NSF REU Program.
