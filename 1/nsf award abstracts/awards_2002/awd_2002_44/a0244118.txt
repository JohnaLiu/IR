This award funds a three-year Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site at Cornell University at the Center for Nanoscale
              Systems in Information Technologies, an NSF Nanoscale Science and Engineering
              Center (NSEC) established in 2001. The program will support twelve students per
              year for research opportunities in nanotechnology. The central emphasis of this
              program is on providing each participant with a stimulating research experience
              and an effective introduction to nanotechnology research. The program is also
              designed to provide participants with new skills and resources to advance their
              research capabilities through short courses on topics that are not addressed in
              the standard undergraduate engineering and science curriculum. These will
              include short workshops on technical writing and public speaking; and short
              course lectures and hands-on experience with scanned probe instrumentation,
              metal machining, electronics, lithography, and pattern-transfer. Students will
              be recruited from throughout the United States for an opportunity to (1)
              experience independent research; (2) develop practical skills for research
              activities; (3) gain in-depth perspective on opportunities in nanotechnology
              and in interdisciplinary science and engineering; (4) become a part of the
              nanotechnology research community; and (5) recognize that effective reporting
              and dissemination of results is an integral part of research. The targeted
              undergraduate participants will be non-Cornell university students with a
              particular focus on students from institutions that are not major research
              institutions and students from population groups underrepresented in research
              fields in engineering in the United States.
