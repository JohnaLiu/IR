Abstract    :
              Concordia College will participate in the investigation of neutron-rich
nuclei
              using the Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) in experiments with fast rare
isotopes
              at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. Concordia College at
              Moorhead
is a member of the MoNA Consortium and has played a leading role in
              testing
and assembling the MoNA detector modules. Concordia undergraduate
              students
will participate in experiments at the NSCL using the MoNA detector
              and perform analysis at Concordia College on the data taken during these
              experiments. MoNA is planned to come online in the Spring of
              2003.


Concordia College will be part of the effort to use MoNA to begin a
              program
of study of nuclear systems along the neutron drip-line.  The high
              detection
efficiency (70%) and modular design of MoNA will allow the study of
              the
structure of short-lived nuclei via selected break-up reactions. Once
              the
sweeper magnet, currently being constructed at Florida State
              University,
becomes operational MoNA will be used to explore the break-up of
              very
neutron-rich nuclei in coincidence with the charged fragments being
              deflected by the sweeper magnet. The neutron-unbound ground states of nuclei
              far from stability will be studied using sequential
particle decay
              spectroscopy.  In addition studies of multi-neutron halos and
              collective
excitations in neutron-rich systems using the MoNA detector and the
              sweeper will be
explored.
