This award funds a five-year Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site at the Pennsylvania State University's University
              Park Campus for 14 students each year for research in electrical engineering.
              The REU site is designed as a nine-week summer experience. Students will have
              an opportunity to participate in a broad range of research projects that
              include both traditional and emergent interdisciplinary fields of electrical
              and electronics engineering. The program will introduce participants to
              hands-on, cutting-edge research experiences especially designed for
              undergraduate students. Each student participant will be paired with a faculty
              mentor to work on a specific research topic. In addition students will
              participate in a number of group activities such as weekly research seminars
              and biweekly field trips to world-renown research centers. At the end of the
              summer program a mini research symposium will be held to give students an
              opportunity to share their experiences. Students will be selected nationwide
              with an emphasis on junior-level students outside of the University Park Campus
              that desire research opportunities. Current research collaborations with other
              universities will be used to assist in attracting students from population
              groups underrepresented in research fields in engineering. This program seeks
              to broaden opportunities and enable participation of domestic undergraduate
              students in research careers in engineering.
