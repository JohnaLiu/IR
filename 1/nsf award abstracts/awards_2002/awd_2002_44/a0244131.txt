Title:  REU Site - Human-Computer
              Interaction

This REU site offers undergraduate students experience in
              research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).  Research lead by faculty mentors
              for this REU site includes investigation of input devices and methods including
              speech recognition, accessibility for people with disabilities, HCI for
              handheld devices, technical and social aspects of HCI for computer supported
              cooperative work (CSCW), inter-cultural aspects of usability, shared
              information seeking behavior and online communities. The program is organized
              around a ten week residential summer research experience for junior and senior
              level students paired with faculty mentors for individual research projects.
              

This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the
              NSF REU program.
