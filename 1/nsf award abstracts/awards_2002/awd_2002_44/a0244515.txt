In this proposal, the aim  is to study a number  of
              problems
related to Banach space  theory and its applications.   Part
of the
              project  deals with the  theory of extensions  of one
Banach space by another.
               For example it is planned to study
the problem  of classifying  those Banach 
              spaces such  that
every minimal  extension is  trivial.   This problem  can
              be
reformulated as a  problem in approximation  theory.  It  is
also  planned
               to  study  applications  to  problems  in the
nonlinear theory  of Banach 
              spaces, related  to problems of
existence  of  uniform  homeomorphisms 
              between  two  Banach
spaces or between their unit balls.  In a somewhat
              different
direction  the  proposer  plans  to  continue  his  
              ongoing
research on  Rademacher-bounded families  of operators 
              with
applications to sectorial operators and semigroups.

The theory of
              extensions can be considered in the  following
terms.  Suppose we are given a
              centrally symmetric solid  in
three or more dimensions and we are allowed only
              to  compute
its  cross-section  by  a  slice  in some directions and
              the
shadow cast  by the  body in  the perpendicular  directions.
This gives
              us some information about the solid, but does not
permit  complete 
              reconstruction.    The  idea  of  studying
extensions is to obtain more
              complete information about  the
body under certain additional conditions. 
              Many questions of
importance  in   mathematical  analysis   and 
              applications,
although  not  formally  expressed  in  this  way,  can  
              be
visualized in terms of extensions.  Sectorial operators  are
of importance
               in the  basic theory  of partial differential
equations  of  evolution  type;
               such  equations  are   very
important in physical  applications.  Typically 
              a sectorial
operator is a differential operator acting on some 
              suitable
space  of  functions.    By  understanding the properties
              of
sectorial  operators  and  the  semigroups they generate one
gains a
              better understanding of the behavior of solutions of
certain partial
              differential equations.
