The Chemistry Division
              award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Montana
              State University for the summers of 2003-2005.  Mary J. Cloninger is the site's
              program director. Twelve different research groups will offer research projects
              and mentoring for10 students for ten weeks in the areas of chemistry and
              biochemistry.   Students will be recruited primarily from the northwest region
              of the US with particular emphasis on Montana colleges and Native Americans in
              this region.  Research projects will involve a broad range of topics including
              isolation and characterization of natural products and biologically active
              compounds, bio-nanomaterials, structural biology, x-ray crystallography,
              bioorganic and biophysical chemistry.  The program will have weekly workshops,
              seminars, and research group meetings.  The participants will write a final
              paper and present a poster on their research at the conclusion of the program.
