This is a

Holomorphic curves 
              recently  have emerged
as a powerful tool in low-dimensional topology.
The
              goal of this project is to unite and coordinate
research in the area of
              applications of holomorphic
curves in order to: 
- construct new invariants
              of manifolds
  of dimension 3 and 4;
- develop new methods for proving
              diffeomorphism
  between the manifolds;
- find new relations between string
              theory and
  symplectic geometry on the one side, and knot
  theory and
              topology of 3-manifolds on the other.
The core of this project, Embedded
              Symplectic
Field Theory, is expected to provide a unified approach
to many
              seemingly different problems in low-dimensional
topology

The impact of this
              project is expected to be much broader
than its immediate goal of developing
              low-dimensional
topology. There is a hope that the  newly developed
              methods
open new horizons in our understanding of links
between Topology and
              Theoretical Physics, and in particular
String Theory. The project should also
              have a significant
educational value. In particular, under this project
              there
will be developed a Dissertation Subject Database,
an actively managed
              and supported list of problems which will
serve as a source of topics of PhD
              dissertation for graduate
students of the senior project personnel.
