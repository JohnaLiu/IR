This award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site
              at the Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory of the National Institute of
              Standards and Technology (NIST) for the summers of 2003-2005.  The program
              director is Albert Lee assisted by co-PI, Jeanice Thomas.  Five technical
              divisions at NIST will be involved: Biotechnology, Process Measurements,
              Surface and Microanalysis Science, Physical and Chemical Properties,  Process
              Measurements.  Nine staff scientists from these divisions will supervise the
              students.  Five students will be supported during the summer for 10-12 weeks of
              research.  Research projects will focus on various areas in chemistry, chemical
              engineering, and biotechnology such as synthesis, analysis, spectroscopy,
              bioinformatics, chromatography, and microscopy.  The program will have weekly
              seminar meetings.  A symposium and student presentation of their work will
              conclude the program.  This site is supported by the Department of Defense in
              partnership with the NSF REU program.
