Abstract    :
              The University of Arkansas continues operating a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site.  Ten undergraduate students are recruited nationwide
              every year for a ten-week summer research experience, with a recruitment focus
              on undergraduates from Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the
              region.  The theme of the REU Site is Modern Optics and Optical Materials. 
              Undergraduate students participate in research projects addressing synthesis,
              characterization and modeling of glasses, semiconductors, and other optical and
              laser materials. In addition to participating in individual research projects,
              REU students attend lab tours and professional development seminars.

This
              REU Site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF
              REU program.
