Abstract    :
              Nine students who have a solid background in mathematics will be selected to
              participate in  an eight-week research experience in computational number
              theory and combinatorics to be held at Clemson University.  Preference for four
              of these positions will be given to qualified applicants who have roots in the
              Southeastern United States, provided that there are a sufficient number of
              qualified applicants from this region.  No more than two of these four special
              positions will be filled by Clemson University students.  The nine students 
              selected will be offered up to $350 in travel support, a dorm room to be shared
              with another participant in the REU, up to $600 for meals and a stipend of
              $2,660 in return for their participation in this program.  

Participants
              will be introduced to various tools, techniques and problems from computational
              number theory and combinatorics.  The participants will be divided into teams
              of two or three and allowed to pick one problem on which to focus for the
              remainder of the REU.  The goal of the program will be to help students attain
              a higher level of independence in mathematical research by giving them the
              opportunity to take part in a significant and interesting research project. 
              Students will also  be encouraged to attend the SouthEast 
Regional Meeting On
              Numbers (SERMON) in the spring of the following year and present their work
              there. 

As a complement to working on their research, students will be
              required to attend a weekly lecture series.  These lectures will be given by
              faculty who have been recognized as leaders in the various fields related to
              the students' research problems and who have demonstrated the ability to
              clearly communicate 
mathematical ideas to audiences of varying levels of
              mathematical maturity.
