Abstract    :
              Schaffner/02-44039
This award provides renewed funding for an REU site at the
              Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), College of William and Mary. The
              award will support twelve undergraduate students each year during a 10-week
              summer research internship. The internship program focuses on interdisciplinary
              coastal marine science, particularly processes operating in the local
              Chesapeake Bay estuarine environment. VIMS is one of the largest institutions
              in the U.S. dedicated to the study of coastal and estuarine systems. Research
              areas available for students include marine ecology, biological and chemical
              oceanography, biogeochemistry, geological and physical oceanography, marine
              fisheries, and marine policy.
