Abstract    :
              In this project, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Duncan will investigate metal ion-ligand complexes
              synthesized in a molecular beam via a pulsed laser vaporization source.  The
              ligands are small molecules.  The spectroscopy and dynamics of these species
              are studied using mass-selected infrared laser photodissociation spectroscopy.
              The experiments measure ligand-based vibrational frequencies as they are
              shifted by bonding interactions with the metal ion.  Cluster solvation shells
              and intracluster reactions are also identified via ligand vibrations. The
              experiments focus on magnesium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon ions complexed
              with one or more solvent or ligand molecules, e.g., carbon dioxide, water,
              acetylene, and others.  Additional experiments include organometallic complexes
              in which metals interact with benzene or polycyclic aromatic
              hydrocarbons.

The experimental studies on both small and large complexes
              will contribute to an improved understanding of metal bonding interactions
              important in inorganic and organometallic complexes, in metal containing
              atmospheres, in metal materials and at biological metal centers.  The research
              is carried out with graduate and undergraduate students as well as with
              postdoctoral research associates.  The project benefits from collaborations
              with outside researchers and internationally with a group in the Netherlands.
