The proposal requests support for 11 U.S. participants to a
              3-day workshop to be held in Seoul, Korea. This U.S.-Korea Joint Workshop is
              about reliability. The workshop aims to bring researchers and practitioners
              from the U.S. and Korea to sharee the latest development and research
              activities to all areas of reliability engineering for a broad range of
              applications. The workshop covers both fundamental and theoretical work in the
              areas of reliability including optimization, muti-state systems, accelerated
              life testing, etc. The U.S. participants include eight junior faculty members
              and two graduate students.
