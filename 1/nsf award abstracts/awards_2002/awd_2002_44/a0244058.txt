Abstract    :
              Montana State University operates a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
              Site affiliated with its Physics Department. Eight students are recruited every
              year for a ten-week summer research experience; the recruitment effort targets
              Native American Indian Tribal Colleges.  Research projects offered to REU
              participants focus on materials physics, including research on magnetic,
              optical and ferroelectric materials, thin film growth and surface science.
              Students also attend research lectures, seminars on written and oral
              communication skills, and participate in organized social activities.
