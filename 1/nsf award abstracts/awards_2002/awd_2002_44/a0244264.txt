Abstract    :
              This project will investigate apparent rapid changes in global temperature in
              the early Danian.  The study will use isotopic analyses of planktic and benthic
              foraminifers and carbonate content measurements in several high-accumulation
              rate deep sea cores to determine the geographic extent and magnitude of a rapid
              cooling event in the early Danian that appears to be related to the Chicxulub
              impact event and a following warm event termed the Dan C-2 event that is
              associated with a large change in carbon isotope values.  The study will focus
              on records from DSDP 465A and ODP 1049.
