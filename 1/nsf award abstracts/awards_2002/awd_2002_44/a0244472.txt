              Abstract 

The principal investigators will work on two fundamental
projects
              in the field of geometric analysis.  The first
project concerns the
              interrelated analytic study of
rational billiards, moduli spaces of
              abelian
differentials, and the dynamics of the Teichmuller
geodesic flow. A
              recent theme has been the interplay
between the dynamics on flows on
              homogeneous spaces on the
one hand, and the dynamics of flows on rational
              billiards
and flat surfaces on the other.  This synergy has led to
recent
              breakthroughs in both subjects.  Broadly speaking, the
principal investigators
              propose to apply the methods and
ideas developed in the case of homogeneous
              spaces to study
rational billiards and dynamics on Teichmuller space.  
The
              second project is to give a combinatorial approach
to the study of Teichmuller
              Space and its geometry.  One
of the major goals is to develop a complete
              analogue
between this theory and the classical theory of the
geometry of the
              modular curve.

Many natural phenomena are studied via the branch
              of
mathematics known as dynamical systems.  One important
example is
              planetary motion. Another centuries old example
is the theory of billiards, or
              the study of collisions of
molecules. Triangular billiards occur in the study
              of
elastic collisions of two masses in an interval.  The
study of a dynamical
              system can take many forms. One
example is to study periodic orbits (or
              repeating
behavior); another is to study choatic behavior.
The principal
              investigators plan to study a variety of
dynamical systems that occur in
              mathematics. One of the
prominent topics will be billiards in polygons in
              the
plane, and a generalization known as flat surfaces.  
These surfaces also
              fit together into a family known as a
moduli space, and the principal
              investigators plan to
study dynamics on moduli spaces. A major component of
              the
project will be educational. The principal investigators
plan to give
              workshops for students, both at the
undergraduate and graduate levels, in
              order to introduce
them to these fields of mathematics.
