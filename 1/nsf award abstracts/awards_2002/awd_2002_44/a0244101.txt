Abstract    :
              The Institute of Ecosystem Studies (IES) will provide undergraduate summer
              research opportunities through our "Ecology in Context" program through funding
              from the National Science Foundation (NSF).  Each summer NSF provides support
              for 10 students who will carry out cutting-edge investigations of their own
              design, working closely with a mentor scientist.  The program emphasizes the
              community nature of the scientific enterprise.  As participants design and
              complete their independent research projects they consult with other
              scientists, present their plans for critique, and then speak in our annual
              Undergraduate Research Symposium and write a paper for a peer-reviewed IES
              Occasional Publication.  The program provides students many opportunities to
              reflect upon and think about the process of science and its place in the world.
               Seminars and informal meetings provide for training in many facets of the
              research process.  Through a case study of a regional environmental issue, a
              career forum, and a day spent teaching high school students from a nearby city,
              students explore the social, political, intellectual and personal dimensions of
              being an ecologist.  The twelve-week program provides undergraduate students
              $3,600 stipend and free housing in an Institute dormitory.  Some assistance is
              also provided for travel to and from the program.
