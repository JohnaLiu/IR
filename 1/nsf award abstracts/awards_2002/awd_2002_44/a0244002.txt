Abstract    :
              This award provides partial reimbursement for 25 participants in the conference
              entitled Teaching Entrepreneurship to Engineering Students.  The Conference is
              organized by Engineering Conferences International (ECI).  ECI is the successor
              of the United Engineering Foundation, which was established in 1962 to provide
              an opportunity for the exploration of problems and issues of concern to
              engineering from many disciplines. The organization recently changed its name
              and moved to be housed at Polytechnic University.   

The conference is
              chaired by Eleanor Baum, Dean of Engineering at The Cooper Union, and is
              co-chaired by Carl McHargue of the University of Tennessee.  The steering
              committee is exceptional including, Phil Weilerstein of the National Collegiate
              Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA), Joel Moses (MIT), Howard Flagg
              (Founder, Pair Gain) and Tina Seelig (Stanford University Technology Ventures
              Program). 

The goal of the conference is to develop a set of recommendations
              for engineering faculty, to identify exemplary curriculum and model programs,
              and to increase interaction between business and academia on these topics.
