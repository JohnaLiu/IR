Abstract    :
              This project uses a novel apparatus for the measurement of gravity-like forces
              in the 10 micrometer to 100 micrometer range, having an estimated sensitivity
              of order Newton's gravity at this range of length scales. The technique is
              similar to that of a miniature Cavendish-type experiment, with the original
              torsion balance replaced by the spring of a cantilever beam. A first generation
              of the apparatus was already built and tested yielding a  first set of data in
              a new excluded range which improves previous bounds by more than four orders of
              magnitudes in interaction strength at the length scale of approximately 10
              micrometers.

The project is expected to impact science at all levels. First,
              all theories that attempt to unify
gravity with the other forces in nature
              involve the modification of Newton's law of gravity. The 
experiment will
              therefore guide the theory in the currently most exciting range of length
              scales. The first set of data put new and important constraints on a large
              class of string theories where
moduli particles are expected to appear as a
              consequence of broken supersymmetry. Since Newton's law of gravity is one of
              the first concepts of nature that young students learn
at grade school, the
              possible modifications of this law at short, but mentally comprehensible,
              distances will ignite young peoples' minds. The problem becomes even more
              interesting as the technology used in the proposed experiment is at the cutting
              edge of micro-fabricated devices.
