Description:  This award supports the US-India Cooperative
              Research: A Multibeam Survey of the Equatorial Carlsberg  and Central Indian
              Ridges  and their Fracture Zones, 3N-10S.  Drs. D. DeMets, University of
              Wisconsin, Madison, R. K. Drolia, Indian National Geophysical Research
              Institute, and R. Mukhopadhyay, Indian National Institute of Oceanography will
              conduct a 3-year multibeam and kinematic study of the Carlsberg(CR) and Central
              Indian Ridges(CIR).  They will examine multibeam data already collected by the
              Indian research ship (R/V Sagar Kanya), study new data generated by Indian
              domestic research cruises, and work on new proposals using the Sagar Kanya to
              map the CR and CIR.  The proposed work is a wide-ranging and long-awaited study
              that will shed light on the axial and transform morphology of a 2000-km long
              unmapped section of the mid-ocean ridge system in the Central Indian Ocean. 
              

Scope:  The proposed research is important for grasping the behavior of
              plates at the fundamental level and for building a plate kinematic framework
              that will lead to better understanding of Himalayan geology.  Study of the
              central Indian Ocean is essential for the global characterization of the ridge
              system and will have favorable impacts on many allied fields.  The merging of
              US and Indian databases will benefit both groups of scientists and eventually
              lead to future shipboard collaborative programs.  The scientists are leaders in
              the field and this study of the Indian Ocean ridge system will contribute to
              resolving some major unanswered questions at the forefront of geophysical
              research.  Additionally, this research has implications bearing on climate
              change and the geodynamics of both oceanic and continental regions.  This
              project is jointly funded by the Office of International Science and
              Engineering and the Division of Ocean Sciences.
