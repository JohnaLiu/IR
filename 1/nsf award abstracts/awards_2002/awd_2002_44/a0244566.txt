This award provides partial support for nine U.S.
              scientists to participate in a workshop with Australian scientists on the topic
              of artificial photosynthesis. The meeting has been co-organized by Prof.
              Christa Critchley of the University of Queensland and Professor Robert
              Blankenship of Arizona State University, among others.  It will be held January
              13-14, 2003 in Sydney, Australia.  In addition to reviewing the participants'
              ongoing relevant research, the workshop is specifically intended to encourage
              and expedite planning of U.S.-Australia cooperation in this area. The workshop
              will immediately follow an international Boden Research Conference that is
              designed to review the state of the art in this interdisciplinary field.
              

Artificial Photosynthesis comprises the design and assembly systems that
              mimic various aspects of the natural photosynthetic process.  Research in
              artificial photosynthesis is motivated by the objectives of improving a wide
              variety of technologies and production systems including energy conversion and
              storage, catalysis, biotechnology, photomedicine, optoelectronics and sensors. 
              Approaches vary from making small modifications to the natural process in order
              to enhance solar energy conversion or storage to  much larger synthetic efforts
              based on specific components of the process that can enable the production of
              new materials.  This workshop is a timely and worthwhile effort involving
              leading researchers in the field from the US and Australia who will identify
              promising areas for future research that can benefit from combining the varied
              and complementary expertise of the participants.
