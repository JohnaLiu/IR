Abstract    :
              There is now strong evidence that some of the most scientifically interesting
              and technologically promising phenomena exhibited by correlated systems occur
              near low temperature phase boundaries.  These phenomena include the spontaneous
              organization of mesoscale charge, spin, and orbital structures, and "colossal"
              sensitivities of physical properties to applied pressure and magnetic field.  A
              better understanding of these exotic phenomena demands greater insight into how
              the low energy dynamical properties evolve across the low temperature phase
              transitions of these materials.  This individual investigator award supports
              research that utilizes a unique method for using inelastic light scattering to
              spectroscopically explore - in a way not previously possible - the important
              evolution of the spin, charge, and lattice dynamics of correlated systems while
              pressure- and/or field-tuning through low temperature phase transitions.   The
              principle focus of this study will be on two classes of phenomena: (A) Quantum
              phase transitions in complex oxides, to study the evolution and effects of
              spontaneous charge-, spin-, and orbital-organization near low temperature phase
              transitions.  (B) Spin electronics in magnetic semiconductors, to explore the
              evolution and impact of magnetic cluster formation near phase transitions.  Not
              only will this research afford critical information about the dynamics near
              various low temperature phase transitions of technologically important
              materials, but it will provide the scientific community a greater understanding
              of the limitations and benefits of applying low-temperature/high-pressure light
              scattering for studying phase transitions and extreme phase regimes in a
              variety of systems.  Further, this project will train graduate student and
              postdoctoral researchers in cutting-edge pressure and spectroscopic techniques,
              eventually adding to the technical base of the country.

Intensive recent
              research has uncovered a variety of functional materials exhibiting
              scientifically important phenomena with technologically promising properties,
              e.g., in magnetic storage devices, magnetic sensors, switches, etc.  These
              exotic properties include extremely large sensitivities of the electrical
              properties to the application of magnetic fields ("colossal"
              magnetoresistance), and abrupt magnetic field- and pressure-sensitive
              transitions between electrically-conducting and -non-conducting phases.  It is
              now believed that these exotic properties are likely caused by the spontaneous
              formation of nanometer-scale structures when these materials transition between
              conducting and non-conducting phases; however, the nature of this causal
              connection needs to be significantly elucidated before scientists can
              understand how best to design these materials for technological advantage. 
              This individual investigator research project will utilize a unique method in
              which laser light is used to study how the magnetic-field- and
              pressure-dependent evolution of nanometer-scale structures give rise to the
              dramatic and technologically-useful properties in complex oxides and
              spin-electronic materials.  The information that will be obtained with this
              project is an essential prerequisite to the effective design and utilization of
              these materials as devices.  Further, this project will train graduate student
              and postdoctoral researchers in cutting-edge pressure and spectroscopic
              techniques, eventually adding to the important technical base of the country.
