Abstract    :
              This conference will bring together experts in the areas of Topological Quantum
              Field Theory, Hopf  Algebras, Category Theory, Representation Theory, Knot
              Theory, and Mathematical Physics.  It will contribute to research in all of the
              above subjects.  Generally, such a conference will increase the knowledge of
              the participants and could result in the invention of new theorems, interesting
              conjectures, and fascinating generalizations.

An essential feature of this
              conference is that it brings together people from many different disciplines. 
              Although these areas of mathematics and physics have impacted each other often
              in the past, not all the researchers in a given field are fully aware of the
              recent advances in the other ones. One goal of this conference is to foster a
              dialogue between the researchers.  The second goal of the meeting is to help
              students, in particular graduate students, and recent Ph.Ds become acquainted
              with the new areas of research.  This will broaden their perspective and will
              contribute to their mathematical careers, mathematical research, and teaching.
              This conference encourages and supports participation of minorities and
              women.
