A theoretical study of acoustic propagation in the Southern
              Ocean and an in-situ test will be conducted to help determine the experimental
              parameters needed to plan future field work. The results will also be of some
              fundamental interest since so little is known about large-scale acoustical
              propagation of signals relevant to float tracking in the Southern Ocean. 
              Future observational studies of the role of small-scale (subgrid scale)
              processes in the Southern Ocean, the transports they produce, and their effect
              on the larger scale circulation will involve a combination of measurement
              techniques, including Lagrangian techniques, because these have played a key
              role constraining lateral eddy fluxes. Floats have also been deployed to
              support both lateral and diapycnal studies with deliberately released tracers,
              in a variety of environments. Acoustically tracked floats have not, however,
              previously been used in large-scale experiments in the Southern Ocean, outside
              of the Agulhas-Benguela current system just north of the ACC (and still within
              the subtropics). Questions of dispersion, for sampling requirements, and sound
              propagation, for float tracking, need to be answered to be able to proceed
              reasonably with experiment design.
