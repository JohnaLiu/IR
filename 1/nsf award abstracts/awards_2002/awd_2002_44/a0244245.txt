Abstract    :
              Our group is active in research that uses spin-polarized beams
              and
spin-polarized targets to study issues in fundamental and applied
              physics.
Currently, our primary focus is in the search for new physics beyond
              the
Standard Model by performing a precision measurement of parity
              violation
in the scattering of polarized electrons by unpolarized electrons in
              a
liquid hydrogen target.  The experiment, which is now being performed
              at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, should eventually provide the
              most
precise measurement of the electroweak mixing angle at low
              energies.

Recently, our group has joined the Star Collaboration at
              Brookhaven.  This
large collider physics experiment is presently commissioning
              a program to
scatter spin-polarized protons with high center-of-mass energies
              in order
to learn about the internal spin structure of the proton.  The
              primary
question being addressed is 'how much do gluons contribute to the
              proton's
one-half spin'.  Data over the next few years is expected to give
              the
first direct glimpse into this important question.  Finally, our group
              is
also involved locally at Caltech in the development of
              spin-polarized
noble gas, namely helium-3 and xenon-129, for use in nuclear
              physics and
magnetic resonance imaging.
