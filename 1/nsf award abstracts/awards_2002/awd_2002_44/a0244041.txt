The Chemistry Division award supports a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Kansas for the
              summers of 2003-2005.  Cynthia K. Larive is the program director and Mikhail
              Barybin is the co-PI.  Twelve students will carry out research with faculty and
              research groups in the chemistry department over a ten-week period.  Student
              recruitment will be principally from Kansas and the 17 states roughly bounded
              by the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains.  Students will work on their
              choice of more than 28 projects in all areas of chemistry.  Many of the
              projects are interdisciplinary in nature.  Twenty per-cent of the mentors have
              appointments in Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry.  The students will
              participate in weekly meetings and seminars to discuss research methods,
              results, and career opportunities.   They will prepare a mid-term oral report,
              a final written research paper and participate in a poster session during the
              final week of the program.
