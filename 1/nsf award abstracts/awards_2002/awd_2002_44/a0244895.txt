Abstract    :
              Nuclei with equal numbers of neutrons and protons near 72Kr provide
interesting
              and important tests of nuclear theory, as they can supply information on
the
              interaction of neutron-proton (np) pairs, and test our understanding of the
              evolution
of nuclear shape. Recently, two possible consequences of np pairing
              have been offered: a
delay in the rotational frequency at which nucleon pairs
              break and align with the
angular momentum of the core, and the apparent low
              level density of odd-odd N=Z nuclei.
The primary focus of this work is the
              collection, analysis and interpretation of data on
low-spin states in the
              odd-odd nuclei 74Rb and 88Y, of which little or nothing is known. 
              The
experiments will be carried out at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) using
              the
Gammasphere array, an array of neutron detectors, and the Argonne Fragment
              Mass Analyzer
(FMA).  A secondary focus of this work is on studies of the
              nucleus 72Kr,
including a low-spin experiment using the Gammasphere array
              coupled to the FMA.  The goal of
this experiment is to observe and
              characterize the states at low excitation
energy and angular momentum,
              including the expected continuation of an oblate band that
has remained
              elusive through the years.  This work will be done with the support of
two
              undergraduate research assistants who will have the opportunity to participate
              in the
setup of experiments, and the collection and analysis of the data.
