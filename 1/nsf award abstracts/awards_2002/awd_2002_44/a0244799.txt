Sixth North American Meeting of
              New Researchers in Statistics and Probability

This proposal describes plans
              for the Sixth North American Meeting of New Researchers in Statistics and
              Probability, a conference sponsored by the Institute of Mathematical
              Statistics, to be organized by and held for junior researchers. The primary
              objective is to provide a much needed venue for interaction among new
              researchers. In contrast with large meetings, this conference will be
              restricted to 90 participants. Sessions will be followed by discussions and
              breaks to facilitate interactions. 

The proposed conference will take place
              July 29-August 1, 2003, on the University of California campus at Davis, CA.
              Housing, meals, and conference facilities will be provided on campus. The Joint
              Statistical Meetings will be held in San Francisco providing an easy
              opportunity for conference participants to attend both events. Participants
              will be statisticians and probabilists whom have received their PhD since 1998
              or are expecting to receive their PhD degree by 2004. Each participant will
              present a talk or poster. Topics will include the gamut of statistical research
              from theory and methods to applications. There will be four senior speaker
              sessions in which topics of particular interest to new researchers will be
              presented. Professor Charles McCulloch from the University of California at San
              Francisco, Professor Xiao-Li Meng from Harvard University, Professor Jessica
              Utts from the University of California, Davis, and IMS president Raghu Varadhan
              from the Courant Institute, have all accepted invitations to speak. Three panel
              discussions during the conference will cover the topics of journal
              publications, opportunities in statistics laboratories, and funding.
