This award funds a five-year Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Alabama Birmingham (UAB) for
              interdisciplinary research in the field of Environmental Health Engineering.
              Students will gain a basic understanding of the mechanisms involved in altering
              environmental, human, and ecosystem health; and the research skills needed to
              analyze and understand environmental issues in the context of engineering and
              public health. Eight students will participate in the first project year, and
              twelve students thereafter each year. The site will provide research
              opportunities to outstanding students from colleges and universities that do
              not routinely provide research opportunities to undergraduate students.
              Students will be recruited from engineering, pre-engineering, and science
              undergraduate programs. In particular UAB will work together with Tuskeegee
              University, Clark Atlanta University, Alabama A&M University, and
              Birmingham-Southern College to recruit students. The research in which students
              will be involved will be in the following general topic areas, based on the
              on-going research of faculty mentors: (1) Air Pollution and Interactions in the
              Human Body; (2) Engineering and Public Health in Disaster Management; (3)
              Environmental Impacts of Coal Combustion Byproducts; and (4) Pollution
              Prevention.
