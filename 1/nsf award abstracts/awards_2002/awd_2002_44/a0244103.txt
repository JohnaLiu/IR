The Chemistry Division
              award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Syracuse
              University for the summers of 2003-2005.  Karin Ruhlandt-Senge is the site's
              program director. Thirteen students will carry out research with faculty and
              research groups in the chemistry department over a two-month period.  Student
              recruitment will be from the greater geographic area, including Pennsylvania,
              New Jersey, New York and to a lesser degree nationwide.  Regional
              first-generation college students and students from low-income situations will
              be targeted.  Research projects from sixteen participating faculty will be
              chosen by the students covering all facets of chemistry, including
              multidisciplinary investigations.  The students will participate in weekly
              meetings to explore technical issues and hear research presentations. They will
              prepare a research paper and present their results at a poster session at the
              conclusion of the program.
