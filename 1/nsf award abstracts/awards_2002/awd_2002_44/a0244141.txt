Abstract    :
              Virginia Tech continues operation of a Research Experience for Undergraduates
              (REU) Site.  The theme of the REU site is adhesives and adhesion science.
              Twelve undergraduate students are recruited every year nationwide for a
              twelve-week summer research experience, with specific recruitment efforts at
              Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the Southeast.  Undergraduate
              students participate in science and engineering research projects in the areas
              of nanomaterial reinforcement and testing of adhesive bonds, and chemical
              modification of surfaces and films for improved adhesion.  In addition, REU
              participants attend a weekly seminar on oral and written communication skills,
              and professional development sessions
