Abstract    :
              This project is focused on two areas of nuclear physics
research. The first
              area is the realization of the basic
symmetries of the strong interaction in
              the low energy
interactions of the nucleon. The second topic is
              the
determination of the Fermi coupling, a fundamental
constant in
              electroweak theory.

Encoded in quantum chromodynamics are various
              symmetries.
In general these internal symmetries yield conserved
              currents
that constrain the interactions of pions and nucleons.
Our
              experiments address the signatures of chiral
symmetry and isospin symmetry in
              low energy
processes. The manifestation of chiral symmetry and
isospin
              symmetry is rich and complex, and involves
spontaneous symmetry breaking and
              explicit symmetry
breaking. Further their realization is deeply connected
              with
the origins of hadron masses, the effects of quark masses,
and the
              special nature of the pion. Our proposed experiments
on muon--nucleon
              interactions and pion-nucleon interactions
will address two puzzles in our
              current understanding
of how both chiral symmetry and isospin symmetry are
              realized
in low-energy interactions of pions and nucleons.

Electroweak
              theory is the fundamental theory
of electromagnetic interactions and weak
              interactions.
The theory is based on two local symmetries which
generate two
              gauge forces. Through the interaction
between these gauge fields and the
              Higg's field the
bosons mix and acquire mass, thus yielding the massive
W, Z
              bosons that mediate weak interactions, and the
massless photon the mediates
              electromagnetic interactions.
The interactions are determined by three
              parameters,
which themselves are fixed by measurements of the fine
structure
              constant, the Z boson mass, and the Fermi coupling
constant. We are
              undertaking a new measurement of the
positive muon lifetime to obtain an
              improved determination
of the Fermi coupling constant. The Fermi coupling
              constant
is an input parameter in all electroweak calculations,
and combined
              with other quantities it permits
both important tests of the standard model
              and key constraints
on the physics beyond.

This experimental research is
              conducted with beams
of pions and muons at the TRIUMF Laboratory in
              Vancouver,
Canada, and the Paul Scherrer Institute near Zurich,
              Switzerland.
The relatively small-scale of our experiments offers both
              broad
opportunities and excellent training for undergraduate
              students,
graduate students and post-doctoral researchers.
