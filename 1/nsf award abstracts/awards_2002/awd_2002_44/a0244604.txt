              ABSTRACT:  EIA 0244604, Indiana Univ., Wm. Aspray, PI

The purpose of this
              project is to carry out a meta-analysis of the forty projects funded in NSF's
              Information Technology Work Force (ITWF) program over its three-year history. 
              This analysis will compare, contrast, and consolidate the knowledge of the ITWF
              projects with other research and implementation projects in the IT workforce
              area.  The final product is to be a report that provides analysis that is
              planned to help guide further research on these topics, as well as recommend
              actions to decision-makers (NSF and other local, state, and federal agencies;
              policymakers at local, state, and federal levels; professional societies; the
              academic community; and individuals desiring more productive careers in the IT
              area).
