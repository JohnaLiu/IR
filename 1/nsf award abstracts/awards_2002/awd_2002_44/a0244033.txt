This award funds a five-year Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Central Florida (UCF) for ten
              students each summer. The program is designed as a twelve-week summer
              experience with research opportunities and other educational experiences in the
              area of optics, lasers, and materials. A primary emphasis of these programs
              will be on encouraging talented undergraduate students, in particular students
              from groups underrepresented in research fields in engineering, to pursue
              graduate studies in the field of optics and lasers. Ten internationally
              recognized faculty in the School of Optics Center for Research and Education in
              Optics and Lasers (CREOL) will serve as research supervisors in the program.
              The program will include (1) Introductory informal coursework on the basic
              principles of optics, lasers, and optical materials; (2) Research seminars for
              undergraduates by the School of Optics/CREOL Faculty; (3) Industrial site
              visits to numerous companies in the area; (4) Seminars, workshops, and
              discussion sessions on issues of ethics in engineering research; and (5)
              Continuous monitoring of the students' progress by the principal investigators.
              The summer program will conclude with a poster session in which the REU
              students will present their research results to the UCF community.
