Kra proposes
              research in several areas of ergodic theory and
differentiable dynamics, with
              an emphasis on applications of ergodic
theory to number theory and
              combinatorics.  The major area of research is
the study of
              ``non-conventional'' ergodic averages, studying ergodic
theorems for averages
              of functions where even if the system is ergodic,
the limit need not be
              constant.  The investigator proposes studying
polynomial averages, averages
              for commuting transformations and averages
along other sequences of
              recurrence.  Additional lines of research are
based on her work on circle
              maps, including connections between the
differentiability of the map, the
              arithmetic properties of its rotation
number and the dimension of its
              invariant limit set.

The project studies the long term behavior of systems
              whose dynamics is
too complicated or too chaotic to be understood locally. 
              Dynamical
systems are used to model problems in natural and social sciences
              and
their study leads to an understanding of the evolution of the
              modeled
phenomena.  The educational portion of the project aims to contribute
              to
the graduate and undergraduate programs at Penn State University,
              with
special courses designed to inject research into the learning process
              at
an early stage. In fall 2003, the PI will develop and teach a course
              on
topological dynamics and Ramsey Theory in the MASS (Mathematics
              Advanced
Studies Semesters) program, a long-standing program aimed at talented
              fourth-year undergraduates chosen in national competition.  The outreach
              portion aims to make the
Mathematics Department at Penn State a more
              attractive place for women to
study and work, with the creation of a focus
              group on women's issues and
support of research projects for undergraduate
              women.
