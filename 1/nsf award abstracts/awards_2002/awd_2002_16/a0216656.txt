Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project creates new
              technology and materials that emphasize data analysis in science education. 
              Data analysis makes scientific concepts and processes concrete and gives
              students another way - besides memorization or analytical understanding - to
              learn quantitative science, often bypassing the need for advanced symbolic
              mathematics.  This project will emphasize physics classes in high school and
              beyond, where labs are often cookbook demonstrations of phenomena and the data
              analysis mere verification.  The first phase of this research, with the help of
              new technology, provided evidence those students understanding and competence
              could be improved beyond their previous capabilities.  This project enhances
              that technology-Fathom Dynamic Statistics Software (KCP Technologies 2000) - to
              make it more useful in the science classroom, and it develops curriculum
              materials that use this software.  Specifically, the firm will produce complete
              manuscripts for two supplemental books in physics appropriate for the
              high-school, AP, or college introductory course: a lab manual and a book of
              problem sets.  In addition, Epistemological Engineering will begin to explore
              and prototype additional materials in physics, materials for other sciences,
              and staff development offerings.

The proposed research will lead to
              significant enhancements to Fathom software and open the door to creating
              curriculum materials in science education using tools previously available only
              to math educators.  Epistemological Engineering proffers technology that will
              contribute to strengthening science education in this country by teaching
              students to thoughtfully approach the world with a zest for measurement and
              prediction.
