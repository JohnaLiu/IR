Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will enhance the
              company's approximate record-matching  software, the Maximum Entropy De-Duper,
              MEDD(TM) by: 1) Enhancing MEDD's performance using advanced standardization
              tools to convert data, such as names and addresses, into standard formats; 2)
              Expanding MEDD's market by matching business names not only person names; 3)
              Internationalizing MEDD to support Canadian French or Mexican Spanish; 4)
              Benchmarking MEDD against the competition and developing a methodology to
              objectively compare matching systems; 5) Reducing MEDD's reliance on training
              data to ease deployment; producing the best possible "untrained" models that
              will adapt and improve through client use; 6) Applying the latest advances in
              machine learning technology to the record-matching problem to increase
              competitive advantage; and 7) Speeding MEDD word blocking with a fast,
              innovative memory-resident data-store.

MEDD's market includes all business
              and government entities that store mission-critical information in large
              databases.  The project will yield societal benefits for public health,
              anti-terrorist efforts, epidemiological research, the U.S. Census, and the data
              quality of records relating to racial and ethnic minorities.
