This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award will provide
              partial support for the acquisition and installation of a gas-source
              isotope-ratio mass spectrometer in the Department of Geological Sciences at
              California State University, Long Beach (CSULB)..  This mass spectrometer will
              enable research projects to be implemented by a consortium of stable isotope
              researchers at CSULB and California State University, Fullerton (CSUF).  Areas
              of research to be carried out using this instrumentation include hydrogeology,
              the fluid evolution of the crust of the Earth, the origin of magmas, ore
              deposits, diagenetic processes in sedimentary basins, and the effect of water
              on deformational processes.  Research opportunities involving stable isotopes
              will now be available to undergraduate students and this technology will be
              incorporated into the curriculum of many courses offered in geochemistry,
              petrology, and hydrology both at CSULB and CSUF.  Thus, this instrument is
              expected to have immediate impact by servicing the teaching and research needs
              of the California State University, the largest educational establishment in
              the United States, as well as the most populous and ethnically diverse
              metropolitan area on the West Coast.
