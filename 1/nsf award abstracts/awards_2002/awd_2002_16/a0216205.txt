Abstract    :
              This project seeks to develop a high-average power, femtosecond laser system
              with
capabilities well-beyond what exists anywhere in the world at present.It
              will generate pulses
with energies of 1-4mJ,with a pulse duration of under
              20fs,and at a repetition rate of 10 - 40
kHz.It will also be capable of
              generating shaped light pulses for experiments in quantum control
of
              matter,optimizing EUV generation,novel high-resolution microscopies,and
              micro-
machining.This laser will be used for a wide variety of application
              experiments which will be
done by the JILA group,and also involving
              collaborators from the University of Colorado,MIT,
SUNY Stony Brook,UC
              Berkeley,Colorado State University,Princeton University,and Wayne
State
              University.Thus,a new,high-performance laser system will be heavily used for a
              wide
range of optical science and engineering projects.Furthermore,the laser
              designs will be made
available to the ultrafast laser community through
              publications,web pages,and technology
transfer to industry.The JILA group has
              a very strong track record of technology transfer,both
to the scientific and
              engineering communities and to industry.Most importantly,this project
              will
also provide an excellent training ground for students in high technology
              areas such as laser and
optical design,fast electronics,EUV generation,novel
              pulse shaping technologies,and
mechanical design.
