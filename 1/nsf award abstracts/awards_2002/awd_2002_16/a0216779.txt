Abstract    :
              This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports the
              acquisition of a field emission gun for a scanning Auger Microscope at PA St U
              University Park. Scanning Auger Microscope is an important tool for the study
              of surfaces, interfaces and thin films. The purchase of an electron gun will
              allow this technique to be performed in existing equipment at Penn State.
              Materials researchers will use scanning Auger microscopy to address important
              questions in the development of 
both conventional and nanoscale semiconductor
              devices, superconductors, and carbon nanostructures. Users in the Center for
              Innovative Sintered Products, Center for Thin Film Devices, and National
              Nanofabrication Users Network at Penn State will also 
benefit from
              availability of the technique. The equipment will be integrated into an
              existing undergraduate laboratory course in materials science and engineering,
              and a new one credit graduate course will be offered to teach students about
              the principles and  operation of the scanning Auger microscope. Both graduate
              and undergraduate students will use the equipment for research.
