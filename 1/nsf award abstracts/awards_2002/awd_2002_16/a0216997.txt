Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will study the use of MEMS
              devices as distributed and embedded sensors for highway material monitoring. 
              MEMS sensors and telemetry systems will be put on a chip (0.5-in in diameter)
              and will be embedded into concrete and act as distributed sensors.  The
              position of each individual smart aggregate in the concrete over time will be
              monitored remotely using radio frequency (RF).  Each chip will contain
              different sensors to monitor concrete compaction quality, concrete stress
              distribution, concrete damage, moisture, temperature, chloride and sulfate
              concentrations, concrete curing and traffic history as well as telemetry and
              long-life powering systems.  To the Principal Investigator's (PI) knowledge,
              the use of MEMS devices as wireless and as integrated sensing method for
              highway material monitoring has not yet been explored.  In the first phase of
              this research, MEMS sensors for temperatures, chloride, stress and traffic flow
              monitoring will be embedded into concrete specimens to evaluate their responses
              under different test conditions and evaluate their durability during concrete
              curing.  If successful, wireless monitoring techniques, including telemetry and
              long-life powering systems will be developed.  The SGER is appropriate for this
              work because of its novelty, and because this work has elements of risk in that
              the MEMS sensing technique may not be well- suited for concrete materials
              because the MEMS sensors may not survive during the concrete curing, or the
              possibility that unforseen difficulties with such a sensing technique may
              arise.  This resesearch will allow the PI to quickly evaluate the concept of
              embedding MEMS sensors into the concrete.
