Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Southwest Texas State University will add CCD
              capability to their P4 diffractometer, which will allow small molecule
              diffractometry. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including the following: a) site-directed mutagenesis; b) combinatorial
              synthesis of catalysts and sensors based on bis-bridged calix[6]arenes; and c)
              polyhedral borane anion investigations.

The X-ray diffractometer allows
              accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a
              molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate
              information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the
              neighboring molecules.  These studies will have an impact in a number of areas,
              including the preparation of more efficient catalysts, chemical sensors, and
              biochemistry.
