Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project builds on
              algorithms developed for simulating turbulent incompressible flows in and
              around time-varying geometries.  The Phase II project proposes to develop and
              commercialize a state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package
              utilizing the algorithms developed.  The computational engine is based upon an
              advanced parallel, adaptive fast multipole (FMM) implementation of a 3-D
              Lagrangian vortex-boundary element method.  Turbulence is accounted for via
              Large Eddy Simulation (LES) using a dynamic Smagorinsky sub-grid scale model. 
              The method is (1) grid-free in the fluid domain, (2) virtually free of
              numerical diffusion, (3) inherently solution-adaptive, and (4) capable of
              modeling inhomogeneous unsteady wall-bounded turbulent flow.  During Phase II
              additional innovative algorithms will be developed for FMM to substantially
              increase it computational speed as well as accuracy.  Additionally, an LES
              model for unsteady inhomogeneous flows will be implemented and tested
              rigorously using problems of potential interest to industry.

The software is
              ideal for simulation and analysis of complex laminar-through-turbulent flow
              phenomena involving massive flow separation, unsteady vortex shedding,
              transient jets in cross-stream, and wake-body interaction.  Examples of
              interest to industry are flow over bluff bodies such as ground vehicles or
              buildings, in data storage units with rotating and moving parts; in internal
              combustion engines; and in and around rotating machinery such as pumps and
              fans.
