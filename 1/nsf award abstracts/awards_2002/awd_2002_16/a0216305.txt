Abstract    :
              0216305  Paul  The objective of this research is to develop a sensor to detect 
              enteric viruses that will have application to provide real-time monitoring of
              problem microorganisms in coastal waters.  Solid phase immobilization of target
              mRNA, amplification and detection by means of microbial beacons is the plan
              that these investigators have.  Each of these steps is available technology. 
              Putting them together to provide real time monitoring of enteric viruses, and
              modeling the data to determine predictive patterns of enteroviral release to
              the environment as a function of environmental perturbation and climate
              variability is to be done with this grant.
