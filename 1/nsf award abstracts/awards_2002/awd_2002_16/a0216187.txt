Abstract    :
              This proposal provides funds for the purchase of a combination laser-amplifier
              system that would allow the PI to enhance her activities in the area of control
              of molecular motion and quantum state character through coherence effects
              inherent in the laser-molecule interaction.  This control is achieved through
              the exploitation of the Autler Townes splitting and electromagnetically induced
              transparency in simple molecules.   If successful, quantum control using these
              coherence effects would complement control achieved through ultrafast laser
              systems.
