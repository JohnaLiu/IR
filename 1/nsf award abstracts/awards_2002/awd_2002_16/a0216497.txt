Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Purchase College, State University of New York will
              acquire a gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric (GC/MS) detection. This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including a) cuticular
              hydrocarbons of Hawaiian Drosophila: Drosophila heteroneura and Drosophila
              silvestris; b) cuticular hydrocarbons and pheromones of the Drosophila
              paulistorum semispecies; c) organoselenium chemoprevention in promotion phase
              of rat mammary cancer; d) investigation of the effects of propylene glycol on
              the biodiversity and chemical balance of Blind Brook; e) synthesis of
              aryltrimethylsilanes via the Diels-Alder reaction; and f) biological
              degradation of methyl tert-butyl ether in aqueous systems and soil microcosms. 
                

Gas chromatograph with mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS) is an
              extremely powerful technique used for the separation and analysis of complex
              mixtures.  These studies will have significant impact in a variety of areas,
              including  chemistry, biology and environmental sciences.
