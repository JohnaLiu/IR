Abstract    :
              This proposal will provide funds to upgrade a detector known as BigBite, which
              will be moved from its present location at the NIKHEF nuclear physics facility
              in the Netherlands to Jefferson Laboratory (JLAB) in Newport News, Virginia. 
              The large acceptance of BigBite will complement the two existing
              high-resolution spectrometers in Hall A at JLAB, enabling experiments to be
              completed in months or weeks that might otherwise have taken years to complete.
               The upgrade supported by this award will enable BigBite to handle the
much
              higher counting rates (up to six orders of magnitude) at JLAB compared to
              NIKHEF.  Key approved experiments that will make use of BigBite include a
              high-precision measurment of neutral pion electroproduction (providing a test
              of chiral QCD dynamics), a measurement of the neutron electron form factor at
              high momentum transfer, and a study of short-range properties in nuclei via a
              triple-coincidence proton-knockout reaction.  The detector upgrade and the
              experiments themselves will involved students and junior investigators in an
              essential way.
