This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant supports the
              research needs of Mount Holyoke College science faculty through acquisition of
              a new scanning electron microscope (SEM) with a low-vacuum sample chamber and
              energy-dispersive spectrometer. A new environmental SEM (JEOL JSM-5610) will
              supercede an existing JEOL 35 CF SEM that is 17 years old and lacks beam
              stability, image quality and the capability to image hydrated or uncoated
              samples. Faculty from multiple departments including biology, chemistry and the
              earth sciences are all engaged in research that will make excellent use of a
              state-of-the-art ESEM.  Specific studies that require high resolution textural
              and compositional analysis of materials include, taxonomic investigations of
              marine invertebrates (Rotifera, Copepoda and Cladocera), studies of latex
              coated industrial materials, studies of graphite-calcite carbon isotopic
              exchange during metamorphism as a proxy of the temperature of formation of
              metamorphic assemblages, compositional mapping of Fe-rich mantle phases to
              better understand deep earth chemical dynamics and redox conditions, and
              taxonomic investigations of agriculturally-engineered crops.  This facility
              will also expand the resources available to Mount Holyoke's renowned
              educational program for women.
