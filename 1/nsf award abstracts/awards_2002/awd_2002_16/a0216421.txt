Abstract    :
              This MRI proposal provides funding for the purchase of a three-dimensial
              particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) device to augment the existing equipment at
              the Auburn University Plasma Science Laboratory (PSL).  The PSL has a unique
              niche in the dusty plasma community - the ability to perform real-time,
              two-dimensional particle transport investigations.  This new device makes it
              possible to overcome the key limitation of the present PIV device, that it is
              only able to measure two of the three velocity components of the particles. 
              Because dusty plasmas, plasmas containing charged microparticles, are present
              in many different environments, from astrophysical systems such as nebula and
              planetary rings to industrial processing tools, understanding the behavior of
              dusty plasmas in detail will have broad impact in a number of fields.
