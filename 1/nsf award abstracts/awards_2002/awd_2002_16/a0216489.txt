Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will focus on
              developing polymer coated superparamagnetic nanobeads for isolation of
              biomolecules; namely cells and nucleic acids. The superparamagnetic nature
              along with the "nano" size of the particles offers low remnant magnetism,
              magnetization at low fields, and larger active surface area per unit volume. A
              proprietary microwave plasma synthesis technique was adopted to reduce these
              nanospheres and the feasibility of the technique was established during Phase
              I. Process scale up and extensive cell/DNA isolation testing will be the main
              R&D objectives for the Phase II project. Industrial partners will evaluate
              beads produced to evaluate parameters, which are critical for transitioning the
              technology to an immediate useful product. 

The commercial potential of
              polymer coated nanospheres can be used in various separation modules. This
              technology could also be extended to isolation and detection of pathogens in
              water.
