Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a new
              analytical tool for characterizing drug delivery aerosols and powders. This
              instrument will be based on a previously developed aerosal mass spectrometer
              that provides real-time size distribution and chemical composition measurements
              for aerosol particles. During Phase I research, a new inlet for the aerosol
              mass spectrometer, allowing  detection of particles in the size range relevant
              to inhalable drug delivery aerosols and powders (2 to 10 mm in diameter), was
              successfully developed. The key objectives of the Phase II project are :  (a)
              to further improve the collection efficiency for particles in the 2 to 10 mm
              diameter size range ; (b) to design and construct a sampling apparatus that
              conforms to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U. S. Pharmacopeia
              Convention (USP) guidelines for sampling drug delivery aerosols from metered
              dose inhalers (MDIs) and dry powder inhalers (PDIs); and (c)to develop and to
              validate an analytical method that meets FDA standards.

The commercial
              applications of this project will be in the area of drug delivery.
