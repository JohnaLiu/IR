Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
              scanning automultiscopic 3-D visualization system.  Current 3-D systems have
              very limited field-of-view or require intrusive headgear with head tracking to
              emulate look-around, and introduce inconsistencies between binocular
              convergence and eye accommodation.  This project will develop a new class of
              3-D displays based on proprietary liquid crystal scanner panels that
              time-sequentially project a large number of perspective images over a wide
              field-of-view into the view space in front of the display.   The device will be
              a fully functioning full color, high resolution 3-D display system with large
              screen, large look-around field-of-view with many-perspective-image scanning at
              a flicker-free rate, using a high speed video projection system.

The
              proposed 3-D system will be used for visualization of multidimensional
              scientific and medical data, for 3-D design and simulation, training and
              education of government and civilian personnel in a collaborative 3-D virtual
              environment, and for telepresence and teleoperation
