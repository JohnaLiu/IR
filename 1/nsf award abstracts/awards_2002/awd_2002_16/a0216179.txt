Funds from this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant will
              be used to acquire a dual-inlet stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer for the
              Department of Geology at Colgate University.  The instrument will be used
              primarily in the analysis of oxygen isotope ratios in silicates by on-line
              laser fluorination, in addition to analyses of gases prepared by combustion or
              reaction with acid off-line. Laser fluorination is the method of choice for
              analysis of refractory mineral separates for oxygen isotope ratio, has short
              analysis times (15-20 minutes per sample), and yields routine precisions of
              +/-0.1 per mil or better for samples as small as 1 mg.  A mass spectrometer at
              Colgate will allow new and continuing interdisciplinary research projects in
              the Geology Department, including studies of granulite facies stable isotope
              thermometry and hygrometry, tectonic, magmatic, and fluid studies of the
              Grenville orogen, plume-ridge interaction in the Galapagos, and studies of
              paleoclimate in Alaska, New York, and Antarctica.  All of this research will
              expose undergraduate students at Colgate to the use of stable isotopes in the
              geosciences, allowing hands-on exposure to modern instrumentation.
