Description:  This award supports US-India cooperative
              research entitled Investigation of the Superelectron Density at the
              Superconductor-Insulator (SI) Transition in Two Dimensions.  US PI Allen
              Goldman, Institute of Technology Distinguished Professor of Physics, University
              of Minnesota will start a collaborative research program with N. Chandrasekhar,
              Indian Institute of Science (IISc).  Goldman's NSF supported research focuses
              on properties of electrons confined to a plane (2D), particularly
              superconductivity in the extreme 2D limit, where there are issues of quantum
              critical behavior and the existence of a metallic state in 2D.  Chandrasekhar's
              efforts are concentrated on similar problems, but with specific experimental
              investigations, which differ from Goldman's.  They propose to join forces to
              carry out investigations on a subset of their respective broader programs.   
              

Scope:  This research will add an international dimension to both research
              programs and will greatly speed the progress of research on measurements of the
              superfluid density near the SI transition.  The collaboration will enhance the
              training of graduate students and postdocs at both institutions and promote
              interaction between the powerful groups in condensed matter theory at the IISc,
              (Ramakrishnan) and at Minnesota (Larkin and Glazman).  These individuals are
              world-class theoreticians.   Goldman's research program is very strong in the
              development of young scientists.  This activity is supported by the Indian
              Department of Science & Technology (DST) under the NSF/DST joint program.
