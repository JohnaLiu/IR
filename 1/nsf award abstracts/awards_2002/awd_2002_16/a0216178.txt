MRI:  Acquisition
              of High Performance Computer For Wichita State University

This proposal from
              an institution in an EPSCoR state, expanding the high performance computer in
              their High Performance Computing Center, enables the faculty in physics,
              chemistry, mechanical and aeronautical engineering, and their students to solve
              large-scale computational problems.  Over 120 faculty, staff, and students will
              use this centralized facility.  The National Institute would also use the
              machine cycles for Aviation Research (NIAR).  The current facilities have been
              outgrown.  Below follows some examples of the projects underway:

1. 
              Integrated Computational Tool for Hypersonic Flow Simulations
2. Evaluation
              and Retro-fit of Fail-Safety in KC-135 Fuselage Structure
3. Design of Plasma
              Sprayed Coatings through Computer Simulation
4. Computational Analysis in
              Adhesive-Bonded Composite Joints
5. Quantum Neural Networks
6. Model
              Atmospheres for Cool Stars
7. Mixed-Metal Complexes: Multielectron Transfer
              Agents
8. Molecular Modeling of Dimeric and Polymeric Ionic Liquids
