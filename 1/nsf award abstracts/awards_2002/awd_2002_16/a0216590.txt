Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
              computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling technology that uses
              state-of-the-art techniques for modeling finite rate chemistry in chemically
              reacting turbulent flows with recently developed numerical methods for solving
              systems of non-linear equations.  In Phase I an improved CFD solver was
              developed that used reduced chemical kinetic mechanisms to model finite rate
              chemistry effect and solved the resulting stiff system of partial differential
              equations with a matrix-free Newton-Krylov method.  In Phase II two
              Newton-Krylov based CFD tools will be developed, one to model combustion from
              turbulent, diffusion flames and the second to model turbulent, pre-mixed
              flames.

The commercial potential for this work is the electric power
              industry, designers and builders of commercial chemical plants, and designers
              of chemical process heaters and other industrial furnace applications.
