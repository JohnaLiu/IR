This is an exploratory project that will use meta analysis
              linked to modeling to  provide a synthesis of the extensive literature
              published on carbon and nitrogen cycling processes in agricultural systems. 
              The expectation is to be able to predict the impact of changes in management
              practices on primary productivity, yields and global biogeochemical cycles. 
              Another product of this work will be to determine the impact of substituting
              N-fixation for mineral N fertilization.
