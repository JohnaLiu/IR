This proposal will create a modern analytical facility at
              Stanford University capable of accurately measuring emerging environmental
              contaminants at trace levels in aquatic systems.  By building on the
              University's new campus-wide Environmental Initiative, this proposal represents
              a strategic opportunity to significantly impact environmental research and
              education at Stanford University among faculty and students in chemistry,
              biology, geological and environmental sciences, and environmental engineering. 
              The proposed emerging contaminant analytical facility will create
              interdisciplinary research opportunities and promote the teaching on the fate,
              transport, and effects of emerging contaminants in aquatic systems.
