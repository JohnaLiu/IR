Abstract    :
              This MRI proposal requests support for several university groups for the
              development of new components for the trigger of the D0 experiment at the
              Fermilab Tevatron antiproton-proton collider. This facility is at the energy
              frontier of experimental particle physics. The primary goal of the experiment
              is to search for the Higgs boson, the physical manifestation of the Higgs
              field. Within the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs field provides
              a means of generating the particle masses and spontaneously breaking the
              symmetry of the electroweak interaction. There are many indications that the
              Tevatron collider could produce the Higgs boson, provided that enough
              antiproton-proton collisions are delivered to the experiments. 

The planned
              luminosity upgrade of the Tevatron will require the experiments to be even more
              selective than in the past and thus an efficient trigger system is essential.
              Selection algorithms giving background rejection factors of more than 105 with
              high efficiency must be implemented in real time. This proposal would support
              the development of the hardware and algorithms necessary for the D0 experiment
              to cope with the higher interaction rates produced at the upgraded
              luminosities.
