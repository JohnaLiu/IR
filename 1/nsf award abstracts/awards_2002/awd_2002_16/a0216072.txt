Abstract    :
              Nuclear Astrophysics has developed a very successful model of stellar nova
              explosions based on a series of reactions in which protons are captured by
              atomic nuclei and high-energy electromagnetic radiation is released in the form
              of gamma rays.  The probabilities of these reactions determine the time scale
              for the stellar explosion events and are unknown in many cases.  The
              measurement of these probabilities is a prominent research subject at a number
              of research facilities around the world.  In many of these studies, a
              high-efficiency gamma-ray detection system would provide a great increase in
              sensitivity for these measurements.  The aim of this project is to establish an
              efficient and versatile gamma-detector system which will be used for
              experimental research in nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics.  The system
              will be used at several laboratories (most of which are capable of producing
              "exotic" ion beams) in the United States in conjunction with charged-particle
              detector systems and spectrometers.  The
components of the detector system
              will be maintained and calibrated with the help of Undergraduate students at
              Purdue University Calumet.
The students will learn essential skills and
              techniques of modern Nuclear Physics experiments, and will assist in the setup
              of the detector array in collaboration with researchers at Florida State
              University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Michigan State University, and
              Argonne National Laboratory.
