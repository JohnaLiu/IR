The goal of this project is to design and develop a
              specialized robot manipulator with a state-of-the-art augmented-reality
              display. This development project is a collaboration of world-leaders in
              engineering, robotics, virtual-reality, motor system neuroscience, and
              rehabilitation; affiliated with the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (RIC),
              Northwestern University, the University of Illinois in Chicago and Barrett
              Technology Inc, an advanced robotics company based in Cambridge, MA. This
              system will be a natural extension of technologies that are currently employed
              at RIC's Robotics Lab.
