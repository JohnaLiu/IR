Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project will develop
              improved monolithic carbon electrodes for capacitive deionization. Capacitive
              deionization technology (CDT) is a new method for purifying ocean and brackish
              well water. In this process, a constant voltage is applied between two porous
              carbon electrodes, and soluble salts are collected on their surface, thus
              purifying the water. The operating costs of CDT are roughly half those of
              reverse osmosis, the current system of choice. 

Obtaining a reliable and
              plentiful supply of clean water is becoming a worldwide problem. From this
              work, society (both in the U.S. and worldwide) will benefit from an inexpensive
              method of producing potable water from large existing reserves of brackish
              (saline) water.  Inexpensive mesoporous carbon electrodes could also be used in
              capacitive deionization for industrial processes such as boiler feed, as well
              as in electrical energy storage, such as in capacitive energy storage.
