Abstract    :
              This grant will provide travel support for participants in the 5th International
              Symposium of the ESIQIE of National Polytechnic Institute in Mexico City, May
              29 - 31, 2002.

The topics covered in the symposium are: environmental
              engineering, energy, process development, thermodynamics, supercritical fluids,
              catalysis and reactor engineering, polymers, process simulation, gas
              processing, petroleum refining, petrochemicals, optimization and control,
              quality, productivity, metallurgical and material processing and materials
              characterization.  Plenary lectures deal with catalysis, thermodynamics,
              reaction engineering, data banks, process simulation, metallurgical processes
              and materials characterization.  In addition to technical sessions, the
              symposium contains an industrial forum and cultural festival.

Immediately
              preceding the symposium, international participants will present a series of
              short courses.  The topics of these courses are: process simulation,
              experimental and theoretical thermodynamics, reaction engineering and
              catalysis.
