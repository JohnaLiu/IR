Lowman
The acquisition of an Environmental Scanning Electron
              Microscope (ESEM),is requested. To date, no Philadelphia area universities have
              ESEM capabilities, so this project would also be of significant interest to
              local universities and industries through partnerships established through the
              Nanotechnology Center. Additionally, the proposed work will have a strong
              impact on Drexel University's educational initiatives with respect to community
              outreach, mentorship activity and graduate/undergraduate education. This will
              also include high students through summer courses designed for underrepresented
              minorities from Philadelphia schools as well as students from Math and Science
              academies. Additionally, new graduate and undergraduate curricula are being
              established that will make use of ESEM as a training tool.
