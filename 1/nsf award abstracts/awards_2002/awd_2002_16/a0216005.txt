Abstract    :
              The sulfur butterflies, Colias eurytheme and C. philodice, common in fields and
              along roadsides across most of North America, are remarkable because they
              hybridize extensively.  Up to 10% of the butterflies are hybrids, an
              interbreeding rate that is sufficient to blend them into a single species. 
              Yet, they have remained distinct.  Many other species pairs show similar
              patterns of hybridization, including Darwin's Finches and numerous plant
              species.  These cases challenge our traditional definition of species, which do
              not normally interbreed.

One untested hypothesis, first proposed in 1957, is
              that hybridizing species do in fact share part of their genome, and that
              selection acts to keep the remaining parts of the genomes distinct.  To test
              this, new methods will be used to map the chromosomes of these butterflies in
              great detail.  This genetic map will then be used for a fine-scale analysis of
              the rates that genes are able to spread between species. 

If superficially
              distinct, hybridizing species do share major portions of their genomes in
              common, then it will cause biologists to restructure their thinking about what
              species are.  It would suggest that species identities can exist as a mosaic of
              genomically complex, stable polymorphisms, maintained in an otherwise dynamic,
              fluid genome.  If this alternative explanation is not upheld, the study will
              provide strong support of the traditional view of species.
