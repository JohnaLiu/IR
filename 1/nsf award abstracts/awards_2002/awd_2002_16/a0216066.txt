This proposal is for the acquisition of instrumentation that
              can be used to measure the carbon-14 isotope. The equipment will support
              undergraduate research activities in Seattle University's Department of Civil
              and Environmental Engineering. The research activities discussed in this
              proposal seek to study uptake and transformation of the explosives RDX
              (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine) and HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-
              tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine) by plants. The requested equipment will enable
              mass balances on [U- 14 C]RDX and [U- 14 C]HMX to be performed which will in
              turn determine the transport and fate of the explosives in plant tissues.
              Previous plant uptake studies with RDX and HMX have indicated an undesirable
              tendency to accumulate in the leaves of plant tissues with slow rates of
              transformation. This project will explore two ways in which to decrease RDX and
              HMX accumulation in plants and thus increase the applicability of
              phytoremediation of these compounds.
