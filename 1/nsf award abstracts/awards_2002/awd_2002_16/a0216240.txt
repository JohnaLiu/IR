Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a
              high level graphical programming environment for distributed measurement and
              control networks used in industry.  Using this environment, an industrial
              control engineer will be able to describe the desired behavior of his/her
              system at a high level of abstraction (e.g. 'control motor speed', 'monitor
              bearing', 'monitor pump') and then "click a button" for the executable
              distributed application to be generated.  In addition, the engineer will be
              able to monitor the behavior of the executing system at the graphical level to
              help identify problems.  This system will automatically partition the graphical
              description into components targeted at specific processors on the network
              based upon the resources required by the algorithm.  This functionality will
              greatly benefit the industrial control engineer, who will be able to focus on
              algorithm and application development rather than details of hardware and
              networking realizations.

As the commercial potential of distributed
              approaches are becoming more prevalent in industrial applications, the
              potential of this software system will grow at a fast rate.  For example, 15
              network controllers instead of one now manage a Proctor & Gamble diaper
              manufacturing line.  Currently the market for distributed measurement and
              control is fragmented, with over 60 proprietary process network standards in
              use.  The advent of the IEEE 1451 smart transducer standard creates a huge
              market opportunity by providing a portable application model that enables
              development tools, such as those being developed in this project, to be used
              with the multitude of existing commercial process busses.
