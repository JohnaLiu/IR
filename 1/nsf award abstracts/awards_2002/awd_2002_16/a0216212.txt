Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further
              develop a new Flow Path Management System (FPMS) representing an innovation in
              Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Supply Chain Management (SCM) that is
              more effective than existing supply-chain management software paradigms,
              incorporates "lean manufacturing" principles, and is more available to smaller
              manufacturing companies than existing systems in that it can be delivered via
              the World Wide Web. The software has the potential to reduce inventory by 20%
              or more in companies with complicated manufacturing operations and/or supply
              chains. In addition, the software can recommend supply chain planning policies
              that increase throughput, decrease cycle times, and improve customer
              service.

The commercialization strategy is to use distribution channels: (1)
              on-site Intranet installations at large companies (2) delivery as a web service
              via the Internet for smaller companies, and (3) licensing the algorithms to
              larger ERP/SCM vendors for incorporation in their software suites.
