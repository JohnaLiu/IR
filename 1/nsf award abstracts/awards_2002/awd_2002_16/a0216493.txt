Heacox, William D.

A 32-inch clear aperture telescope will be
              built and instrumented by the faculty and students of the University of Hawaii
              at Hilo, Hawaii for the purpose of training students in astronomical
              instrumentation technology development and for use by the astronomical sciences
              research faculty for compelling research in the areas of: evolution of galaxies
              in dense clusters, the formation and early evolution of multiple star systems,
              the formation and early evolution of planetary systems and the chemical
              evolution of our galaxy.  The State of Hawaii will provide the building and
              observatory dome). The undergraduate astronomy degree program at the University
              of Hawaii, Hilo, will extensively use the planned observatory.  Young people of
              the State of Hawaii will be trained for careers in astronomy and for technical
              jobs within the many Observatories on Mauna and in Hilo.
