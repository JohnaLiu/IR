Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Sweet Briar College will acquire a 300 MHz NMR
              Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a)
              structure-activity relationship, and the synthesis and testing of analogs of
              bioactive compounds; b) structure elucidation and characterization of natural
              products; c) the synthesis of novel ligands for palladium and platinum
              bioactive compounds; and d) the synthesis and purification of dithiophosphate
              oligonucleotides, and the testing of activity in cell culture of antisense DNA.
                Faculty at Randolph-Macon Women's College, Hollins University and The
              University of the Virgin Islands will also have access to this equipment. 
              

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
              available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
              used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
              atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from
              these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas including
              biochemistry and drug development.
