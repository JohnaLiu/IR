Abstract    :
              0216531
John
Texas A&M University-Kingsville (TAMUK) seeks NSF support for the
              acquisition of a gas chromotograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS).  The proposed
              GC/MS will include peripherals to enhance and supplement the research abilities
              of the department.  Research interests in the following areas would benefit
              immediately:

Hydrocarbon characterization in the ambient urban atmosphere
              and the evaluation of voc/n0x ratios in Corpus Christi.

Characterization of
              sorption and interphase mass-transfer of complex mixtures and their
              constituents for use in risk and remedial applications.

Research project to
              evaluate potential fruit and nut organic compound bio-accumulation near
              contaminated groundwater sites.

Control of ozone precursors using an
              enhanced oxidation - biofiltration technology .

Innovative biofilter designs
              for chlorinated compound and dioxin precursor air emission
              control.

Surrogates for dioxins furans monitoring from combustion
              emissions.
