MRI: 
              Acquisition of a Network of Workstations Serving as a Platform for Distributed
              Automated Reasoning

This proposal from an EPCoR state, adapting current
              parallel and distributed theorem 
proving technology to a setting in which
              different computation servers become available in an unpredictable fashion,
              aims at building a network of workstations that can be used as a computational
              server for research. A cluster of high-performance workstations running Linux
              and the required networking infrastructure will be acquired. The effort will
              make available a large proportion of the computational facilities of the
              department for theorem proving efforts. In this setting, the search for the
              proof of a single theorem will be spread between all the idle workstations
              participating in the distributed proof effort.
In extending model checking to
              infinite state spaces, the research involves exploring two approaches for
              protocol verification: Development of,
1.  On-the-fly model checker based on a
              3-values logic and,
2.  Theorem proving methods that can reduce a protocol's
              state space to a finite size.
