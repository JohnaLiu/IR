Title:  MRI/RUI/MII: Acquisition of a Linux Cluster Super
              Computer for Meteorological Modeling and 
           Computer Science Research
              and Education 

Project Proposed:

This proposal from an RUI/MII
              institution, establishing a Linux-based parallel computing cluster, aims to
              simulate meteorological phenomena and study and teach the use of parallel
              processors. The infrastructure will be used in support of ongoing
Numerical
              modeling of the atmosphere of Mars using the Mars Regional Atmospheric Modeling
              System (MRAMS) and
Computer Science Research in the parallel and distributed
              hardware and software.
The first component will benefit the following current
              research underway:
Large eddy simulations (LESs) of the Martian atmosphere to
              provide insight into the structure and dynamics of the highly unstable
              convective boundary layer (including the dynamics of dusts devils)
Mesoscale
              simulations of past and proposed Mars landing sites
Simulation of local and
              regional dust storms, and wind-produced landforms (aids satellite
              observations)
Simulations of orographic water ice and carbon dioxide
              clouds.
The second component will investigate and/or explore
Software
              optimization of the MRAMS code (tune it for maximum performance on hardware
              platform) and
Alternative hardware architectures for high-performance
              computing
The cluster will serve as a central research platform to investigate
              processor-to-processor communication overhead, memory contention of symmetric
              multiprocessors, cache coherence, and distributed processing. Moreover,
              performance of novel processor, memory, and network topologies will be
              evaluated.
