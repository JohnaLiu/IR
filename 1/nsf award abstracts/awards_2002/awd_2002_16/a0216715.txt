Abstract    :
              A state-of-the art (scanning)transmission electron microscope (TEM)will be
              upgraded to an environmental TEM allowing near-atomic resolution imaging at
              pressures up to 8 Torr and temperatures up to 900 degree C. These capabilities
              are vital for proposed nanoscience, biotechnology and environmental science
              research. Near-atom-scale patterns will be defined by electron-beam
              decomposition of molecules adsorbed on surfaces. In situ investigation of
              vapor-liquid-solid grown Si nanopillars will facilitate rapid process
              optimization allowing growth on technologically relevant Si(100) surfaces.
              Characterization of artificial bone synthesized using genetically engineered
              osteoblasts will be facilitated by the capability for imaging hydrated
              specimens. Imaging at elevated pressure and temperature will be employed to
              discover novel materials useful for mineral sequestration of greenhouse gases.
              These advanced characterization capabilities will be fully integrated into the
              classroom learning experience and will significantly enhance industrial
              outreach facilitating academic/industrial knowledge transfer.

              state-of-the art (scanning)transmission electron microscope (TEM)will be
              upgraded to an environmental TEM allowing near-atomic resolution imaging of
              diverse samples at pressures of up to 8 Torr and temperatures of up to 900
              degree C. These capabilities are vital for cutting edge research proposed in
              strategic thrust areas at ASU including nanoscience and technology,
              biotechnology and environmental science. Specifically, electron beam stimulated
              surface chemistry will be employed for writing near atomic scale patterns,
              real-time imaging will be used to optimize process conditions for Si nanopillar
              formation, characterization of tissue engineered artificial bone and in situ
              investigation of mineral sequestration of greenhouse gases. The advanced
              characterization capabilities of this instrument will be fully integrated into
              classroom learning at ASU through its internet connection to the Goldwater
              Materials Visualization Facility. Further, these capabilities will enhance
              academic/industrial knowledge transfer facilitated by our highly successful
              Industrial Associates program.
