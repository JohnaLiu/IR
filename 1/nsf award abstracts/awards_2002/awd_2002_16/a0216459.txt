This Major Research Instrumentation award to San Francisco
              State University's Romberg Tiburon Center provides funds for acquisition of
              research instrumentation for isotope tracer research in coastal marine science
              and estuarine ecology.  Instruments supported here include a stable isotope
              mass spectrometer with gas chromatograph interface, a high resolution
              scintillation counter, and an elemental analyzer and reduction furnace.  The
              instruments will be used in a variety of projects, including ongoing studies of
              carbon and nitrogen fluxes in phytoplankton near Bodega Bay, CA, oceanic
              fixation of nitrogen by Trichodesmium, nitrogen dynamics of natural planktonic
              communities in response to iron enrichment, coupling of carbon and nitrogen
              cycles in coastal upwelling, and invasive species in the San Francisco Estuary.
               The instrumentation award is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at
              NSF. San Francisco State University will provide cost-share support from
              non-federal funds for a portion of total project costs.
