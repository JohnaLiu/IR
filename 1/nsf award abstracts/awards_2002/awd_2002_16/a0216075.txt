Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Washington and Jefferson College will acquire a400
              MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will facilitate the following studies:  a)
              characterization of polymers, specifically by studying the aging phenomena of
              solicone elastomers; b) design and synthesis of potential metallomesogens; and
              c) synthesis of new DNA analogs with an amide linkage.   

Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists
              for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify
              unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
              solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
              studies will have an impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry
              and biochemistry.
