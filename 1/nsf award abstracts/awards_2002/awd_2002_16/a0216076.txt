Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will demonstrate
              a capability for locating imperiled firefighters in buildings using wireless
              technology based on long wavelength signals that penetrate buildings with lower
              perturbation than observed at higher frequencies. The system is being developed
              for firefighters (estimated 5 year market of over $150 million) but is useful
              for any application requiring geolocation in buildings where GPS cannot work.
              Such applications include tracking personnel and equipment in crisis
              situations, military combat, inventory management and police and military
              training. This concept has significant advantages over competing technologies;
              ultra-wideband solutions pose frequency licensing problems, and man-portable
              inertial units are bulky, costly and have significant time-dependent errors.
              

The Wireless Firefighter Lifeline (WFL) system is completely mobile and
              supports multiple firefighters. It complies with Part 15 rules and will not
              require FCC licenses. Phase II will demonstrate the underlying technology over
              a wide range of conditions and will produce a prototype system that will serve
              as the baseline for future system development. It provides extensive commercial
              and societal benefit, offers performance superior to that of other potential
              technologies, and is well positioned to attract further funding.
