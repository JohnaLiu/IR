Abstract    :
              This project seeks to expand our understanding of the years surrounding the
              South Sea Bubble of 1720, the first great financial crisis of modern
              capitalism, by focusing on the individuals who actually purchased shares and
              thus made portfolio decisions.  We examine in detail the responses of stock
              market participants before, during, and especially after the financial collapse
              of the South Sea Company.  To do this, we exploit data we have already
              collected (NSF 99-11270) and continue to collect and encode on the holdings and
              transfers of the major financial assets available in the London market among
              all individuals who held these assets before, during, and after the crisis of
              1720.  We reconstruct the transfers of stock holdings in the South Sea Company
              itself after its reorganization in 1723, as well as in the Bank of England, the
              East India Company (both competing with the South Sea Company for investors),
              the Royal African Company (complementary to the South Sea Company), and the
              Hudson's Bay Company (completely removed from the action).  Combining all four
              sources, then, we determine how all stockholders responded to the spectacular
              rise and fall of the South Sea Company in two competing companies, a
              complementary company, and a noncommittal company.
Our examination of the
              changes that took place in the distribution of these assets, especially in the
              period 1721 to 1730, is an intensive analysis of the reallocation of financial
              risk by market participants in the first emerging market after a major
              financial collapse.  Especially interesting to us are contrasts in trading
              activity between the pre- and post-bubble periods and the changes we observe in
              activity by specialized traders as well as the role played by the increasingly
              diverse consumer base.  Analyzing these changes in individual behavior within
              the unregulated and untaxed stock market of the time helps us understand how
              financial markets recover from systemic shocks.
