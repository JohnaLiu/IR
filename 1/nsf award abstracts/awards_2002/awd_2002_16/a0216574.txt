Abstract    :
                   This SBIR Phase II project will develop a through material imaging system
              that will locate
human targets through opaque media. The technology will also
              provide wide area subsurface sensing for ground probing applications. The phase
              I results demonstrated that the system has the capability of detecting human
              targets on the opposite of building walls and through walls of granite over 10m
              thick. The thrust of the phase II research lies in software development to
              classify targets in the downrange profile, track targets, and count targets;
              and hardware development to eliminate the need for an external off the shelf
              receiver. The latter effort will also require software development to process
              data for the classification algorithms. The unique innovation of this project
              is that it can conduct full area investigations and locate stationary targets
              from a fixed location.
     There are two primary applications for this
              technology, situational awareness and subsurface investigation. The former,
              which is the most attractive for early market entry, comprises homeland
              security, police/fire/search and rescue, and military actions where the
              location of human subjects on the opposite side of walls, vegetation, snow,
              fire, or other opaque media is sought. The latter includes geophysical
              exploration, ore body investigation, utility detection and location, road-bed
              and bridge subsurface scans
for cracks and voids, and unattended ground
              sensing from a fixed point to assess subsurface changes that can be used to
              predict earth or structural failure.
