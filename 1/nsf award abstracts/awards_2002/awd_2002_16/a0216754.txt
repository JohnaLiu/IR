Abstract    :
              Economic theory suggests that the lack of product market competition in
              non-competitive industries gives employers in these industries more latitude to
              employment discriminate relative to employers in fiercely competitive
              industries. This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will utilize
              individual data from the Current Population Survey and industry data from the
              Census of Manufacturers and Manufactured Commodities to explore factors, which
              influence the racial composition of US industries.  Particular emphasis will be
              given to examining the influence of product market competition on racial
              employment.  The specification developed will measure the influence of both
              foreign and domestic competition on racial composition.  Indeed, if the stated
              hypothesis holds true, competition, regardless of its source - international or
              domestic product markets- will reduce employers' ability to engage in racial
              preference hiring. Additionally, the developed empirical model will allow for
              labor supply and labor demand effects that may influence the racial composition
              of industries.
