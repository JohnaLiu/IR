Abstract    :
              This is a Major Research Instrumentation award to support the development of an
              instrument for measuring the absorption of aerosol particles at different
              wavelengths in the solar spectrum.  Aerosols absorb and scatter solar radiation
              and thus influence regional and global climate.  Though accurate data on
              aerosol absorption spectra are lacking, the available evidence indicates that
              aerosols from different sources have markedly different spectra.  For example,
              Saharan dust appears to absorb strongly in the ultraviolet but weakly in the
              visible part of the spectrum.  Diesel soot, on the other hand, absorbs more
              uniformly over the spectrum.  To now, no instrument has been available to
              measure the in-situ absorption of aerosols at more than two wavelengths, though
              what is needed for radiative transfer calculations is a detailed representation
              of the absorption spectrum.  Accordingly, a multi-wavelength unit will be
              built, based on the resonant photoacoustic principle, to measure the absorption
              at six wavelengths spanning the spectrum from the ultraviolet to the infrared. 
              Calibration is established by measuring the (known) absorption of the 760-nm
              oxygen A-band.  The instrument will be employed for measurements of the
              spectral absorption of different kinds of natural and anthropogenic aerosols. 
              This information is essential for understanding the consequences of the human
              use of combustion on climate.
