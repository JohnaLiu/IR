This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant provides
              support for investigations of  possible alternative Aluminum compound source
              targets for subsequent Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS)-based analysis of
              sputtered Al- ions to determine the isotopic abundance of the cosmogenic
              nuclide 26Al.  Aluminum-26 is a rare isotope that can be used to date exposed
              rocks surfaces.  The capability of AMS for high precision analysis of 26Al for
              surface exposure age dating has created something of a resurgence in the field
              of geomorphology where scientists have long struggled to nail down rates of
              erosional processes.  This effort will investigate two alternatives to the
              current standard Al2O3 source target for subsequent AMS analysis of 26Al,
              namely, aluminum nitride (AlN) and aluminum boride (AlB2).  Preliminary work
              conducted at PRIME Lab by the investigator has shown some evidence for much
              higher negative Al ion yield as a result of Cs+ sputtering of AlN and AlB2
              targets than for standard alumina targets but potential isobaric interferences
              were not fully resolved.  The PI and an undergraduate student will therefore
              conduct further interlaboratory AMS analyses of AlN and AlB2 targets at the
              Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement facility (PRIME Lab) and at the higher energy
              Livermore AMS facility, GEOCAMS to further characterize new target materials. 
              In addition, they will conduct preliminary testing of storage, packing and
              loading of samples to assess possible sample degradation that would effect
              subsequent AMS analytical precision and accuracy and will disseminate the
              results.
