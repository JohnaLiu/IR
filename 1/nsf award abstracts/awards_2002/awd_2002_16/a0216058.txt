Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin in Eau Claire will 
              acquire a Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and sampling
              accessories.  This instrument will support research in a number of areas,
              including a) fundamental vibrational spectroscopy to determine molecular
              structures; b) investigations of protein structure, dynamics and interactions
              with surfaces; and c) inorganic synthesis, aimed at modeling enzyme functions,
              as well as developing catalysts for organic reactions and olefin polymerization
              processes.  

The general effectiveness of Fourier transform spectroscopic
              techniques in academic and industrial research has been firmly established. 
              Many advanced spectroscopic courses now routinely include the teaching of FT
              spectroscopy.  These studies will have an impact in areas such as surface
              science, catalysis, materials science and biochemistry.
