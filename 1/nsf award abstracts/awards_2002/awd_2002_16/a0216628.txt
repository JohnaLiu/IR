Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will build upon
              and extend the encouraging results obtained in the Phase I program, which
              investigated the properties of thin, electrically conductive, UV transparent
              films and tri-layer metal coatings as possible diamond switch electrode
              structures for power electronics. Phase I benchmarked UV transmission,
              electrical conductivity and substrate adhesion for 14 to 44 nm Mo films,
              deposited using an energetic filtered cathodic arc deposition process. A
              companion program demonstrated a significant reduction in the diamond switch
              on-state resistance, and hence, improvement in switch efficiency, using these
              films as contact electrodes. The Phase II program will apply these results to a
              commercially relevant specification by demonstrating that the thin film
              deposition process can be scaled and the complex thin film mesa-shaped
              electrode topology can be realized. The anticipated mesa-shaped design will
              consist of a series of narrow tri-layer conduits, with the relatively large
              spaces in between coated with the thin UV transparent, electrically conductive
              film. This design maximizes the UV input into the diamond, which is used to
              activate the switch, while minimizing the electrical resistance. The properties
              of the electrode will be benchmarked against commercially relevant operating
              requirements.

The project's commercial potential is considered significant
              since it both supports the entry of diamond switch technology into the $21
              billion per year power electronic device market as well as advancing the
              energetic deposition process thin film knowledge base, which in turn provides
              an improved platform for launching additional commercial ventures.
