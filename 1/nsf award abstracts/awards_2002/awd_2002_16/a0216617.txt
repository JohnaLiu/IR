Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Lawrence
              Margerum and colleagues at the University of San Francisco will acquire
              electrochemical instrumentation to enhance research training and teaching.  The
              equipment includes a very sensitive potentiostat/galvanostat, a frequence
              response detector for AC impedance measurements and modern software to be used
              with microelectrodes.  Research projects that will exploit this instrumentation
              include a) voltammetric studies of small molecule binding to potential
              macromolecular catalysts (dendrimers); b) characterization of the redox
              properties of potential bioinorganic catalysts; c) measurements of
              heterogeneous electron transfer rates via rapid scanning techniques; and d)
              characterization of the biological gels found in the electrosensory organs of
              sharks.  

This equipment will be used in advanced undergraduate courses in
              the Chemistry and Environmental Science departments at the university, and in
              an outreach program for a community-based sampling program in collaboration
              with teachers and students at local high schools.  These studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including development of more efficient catalysts
              for the manufacturing industry and polymer chemistry.
