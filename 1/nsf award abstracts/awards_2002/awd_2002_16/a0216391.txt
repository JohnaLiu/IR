Abstract    :
              A grant has been awarded to Dr. Jeffrey M. Osborn at Truman State University to
              enhance undergraduate research opportunities at Truman through the acquisition
              of electron microscopy instrumentation. Funds from this grant will be used to
              purchase the following instruments: 1) a digital image system for an existing
              transmission electron microscope (TEM), 2) a digital image system for an
              existing scanning electron microscope (SEM), 3) an ultramicrotome, 4) a block
              trimmer, and 5) a critical point dryer.  
	This proposal brings together five
              faculty members who utilize electron microscopy in their research and teaching.
              1) Pollen Developmental Evolution in Basal Angiosperms - Jeffrey Osborn (PI). 
              2) Functional Morphology of Prey Capture by Arrow Worms - George Shinn (Co-PI).
              3) Structure-Function Relationships in Fleas: Water Uptake - Laura Fielden
              (Co-PI).  4-5) Programmed Cell Death in Maize - Diane Janick-Buckner and Brent
              Buckner (Co-PIs).   
Truman is Missouri's highly selective, public liberal
              arts and sciences university, whose mission includes a significant emphasis on
              involving undergraduate students in original research.  Student research is
              achieved through faculty mentoring of individual and group projects, as well as
              direct inclusion of original research into the curriculum.  Electron microscopy
              continues to play a pivotal role in both approaches.
