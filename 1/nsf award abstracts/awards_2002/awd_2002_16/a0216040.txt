Abstract    :
              This proposal provides funds for the purchase of a solid-state,
              frequency-stabilized, single-mode cw laser system that will have several
              applications within the context of an undergraduate research and education
              program.  The laser will be used to pump a 12 femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser for
              the research purpose of probing and modifying collective motion of atoms in
              solids using shaped pulses, ultra-short pulses, and optical control feedback
              techniques based on genetic algorithms.  The educational applications focus on
              optical trapping and acceleration of particles via a laser-tweezer technique,
              interferometry, and non-linear optics.
