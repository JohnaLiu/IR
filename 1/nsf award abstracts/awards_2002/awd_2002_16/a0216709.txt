Abstract    :
              Many nutrients, natural toxins, and manmade toxins and drugs are hydrosoluble
              (soluble in water).  Efficient transport of hydrosoluble chemicals across the
              vertebrate small intestine is generally thought to depend on membrane transport
              proteins (mediated transport), but some birds can efficiently transport
              hydrosoluble chemicals through the gaps between cells (i.e., by a passive
              paracellular pathway).  This research will (1) test the generality of this
              finding in other birds, mammals, and reptiles spanning a broad size range (0.05
              kg - 50 kg), (2) test mechanisms that may explain differences among species in
              the importance of paracellular transport of hydrosoluble chemicals, and (3)
              determine hydrosoluble absorption of toxins by the paracellular pathway. 
              Physiological, pharmacokinetic, and microscopy  techniques will be used to test
              these hypotheses.   The differential absorption of carbohydrate probes, which
              range in size from 150 -666 Daltons, will be used to assess how the gap between
              cells restricts transport according to molecular size.  Differences in the
              absorption of two forms of glucose (D- and L-glucose) will provide information
              about the relative rates of glucose absorption by the mediated versus passive
              pathways.  The effects of a nutrient (sugar) in the gut on absorption will be
              determined. Intestinal tissues will be examined via light and electron
              microscopy to characterize structural features (e.g., intestinal surface area
              and density of tight junctions at the gaps between adjacent cells) that may
              contribute to variation in paracellular absorption.  Another study will measure
              absorption of a man-made hydrosoluble toxin (the herbicide glyphosate) and a
              natural hydrosoluble phytochemical (anthocyanin) in two species.  Movement of
              the toxin glyphosate along the paracellular path between (not through)
              intestinal cells will be directly observed using autoradiography.  The proposed
              studies have important implications for vertebrate ecology, digestive
              physiology, evolutionary physiology and ecotoxicology.
