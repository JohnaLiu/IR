Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Martin Kirk
              and colleagues at the University of New Mexico will acquire a combined
              X-band/Q-band CW EPR/ENDOR spectrometer.  Projects that will exploit this
              instrument include a) studies of molybdoenzymes and relevant model complexes;
              b) research on thermally induced charge transfer materials; c) the use of
              cobalt as a spectroscopic probe of zinc sites in metalloproteins; d)
              spectroscopic studies of high symmetry cobalt coordination compounds; and e)
              biophysical studies of photosynthetic water oxidation and iron regulation.
              

An electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer is an instrument used
              to obtain information about the molecular and electronic structure of
              molecules. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of
              free radicals which are often essential for the initiation of tumor growth
              and/or a variety of chemical reactions.  These studies will have an impact in a
              number of areas, in particular biological chemistry.
