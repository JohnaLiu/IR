Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to develop a
              novel method for on-site and on-demand generation of an extremely potent and
              safe disinfectant.  Phase I research has established the basic feasibility of
              this unique method to generate the disinfectant, as needed, at appropriate
              concentrations. The overall objective of the Phase II project is to design,
              demonstrate, and challenge test a fully operational bench-scale device for
              on-site and on-demand generation of the disinfectant. Additional work will be
              done to improve the yield of the disinfectant, to examine various additives,
              and to conduct antimicrobial experiments in accordance with EPA test
              requirements.

The commercial applications of this project will be in the
              areas of domestic/personal healthcare, food service and healthcare delivery.
