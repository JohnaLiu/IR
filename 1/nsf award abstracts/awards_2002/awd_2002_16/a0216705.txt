Abstract    :
              This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports
              Florida International University with the acquisition of a structural
              monitoring system for a laser- molecular beam epitaxy (LMBE)-scanning tunneling
              microscope system. The PI's will construct comprehensive tools with
              multi-component growth capability coupled with in-situ nano-scale
              characterization capabilities. This is essential for success in "Complex
              Materials Growth by Design." The in-situ structural monitoring system includes
              a newly designed in-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED)
              instrument for real-time monitoring of materials growth and low-energy electron
              diffraction (LEED I-V) optics for surface structure determination will be the
              essential component for the studies of artificial structured materials. The
              system will be added on a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) system, forming a
              controlled growth LMBE facility. This facility will be integrated with a
              variable temperature (VT) (25 - 1500K) scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and
              other existing surface characterization probes with a growth capability in an
              ultra-high vacuum (UHV) cluster. The objective is to construct a unique
              facility capable of growing and characterizing materials in-situ for
              interdisciplinary research and education of materials scientists in the new
              field of nano-technology.  The goal is to: 1) exploit materials tailoring for
              desired functionalities, 2) explore new physical phenomena in artificially
              structured materials, and 3) educate a new breed of materials scientists with
              an expertise in science-driven nano-fabrication.
