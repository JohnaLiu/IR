Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry
              Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Programs, Prof. Mark A. Berg of
              the University of South Carolina will develop a state-of-the-art 2D vibrational
              spectrometer for materials characterization based on NMR analogs. 
              Two-dimensional vibrational spectroscopy can be used to directly probe the
              inter- and intramolecular vibrational coupling patterns in complex molecular
              systems.  The 2D vibrational spectrometer combining infrared and Raman lasers
              can be used to study time-resolved structural evolutions of various systems
              including protein-ligand, organic-inorganic materials and other systems.  Thus
              it promises to be one of the major experimental tools in characterizing the
              molecular nature of functional materials such as conjugated polyenes, in
              determining ultrafast dynamics of protein and protein-ligand binding processes,
              and in studying microscopic solvation dynamics by directly probing the
              real-time dynamics of solvent molecules close to solute molecules.   

These
              studies will have important consequences in each of the above areas, and
              accelerate the national development of two dimensional vibrational
              spectroscopy, an important emerging area.  In addition, student participants
              will be exposed to a wide range of techniques.
