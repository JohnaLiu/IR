Mathematical Sciences: VIGRE Program Meeting
              2002

The Mathematical Association of
              America (MAA), the American Mathematical Society (AMS), the American
              Statistical Association (ASA), and the Society for Industrial and Applied
              Mathematics (SIAM), will host a meeting to provide information about the
              program in Vertical Integration of Research and Education (VIGRE) of the NSF
              Division of Mathematical Sciences.  Attendees will be representative faculty
              members from U.S. institutions with Ph.D.-granting departments of mathematical
              sciences.  This award supports attendance of these representatives at the
              meeting.

Since the VIGRE program (now in its third year) has awarded
              approximately thirty grants, valuable experience with the various core elements
              of the VIGRE solicitation should now be shared with the mathematical sciences
              communities. This conference of interested parties will emphasize the
              experiences and exemplary practices of VIGRE projects nationwide.  The format
              of the meeting allows for discussions of the impact that the VIGRE program has
              had on the mathematical sciences both locally and globally.
The meeting, held
              in the Washington, DC area on 3-4 May 2002, includes speakers from institutions
              that employ mathematical scientists, including a variety of academic
              institutions, business, industry, and government agencies. It is anticipated
              that between 125 and 150 interested mathematical scientists will attend this
              meeting.
