Funds from this grant will support the purchase of synthetic
              aperture radar (SAR) imagery from agents of the European Space Agency.  The SAR
              imagery will be archived at computational facilities of the Western North
              America InSAR (WInSAR) Consortium.  SAR imagery supports tectonic,
              volcanological, and hydrologic research by consortium members through
              interferometric analysis of temporally separated SAR pairs to detect to
              spatially continuous, subtle (mm to cm) deformation of the earth's surface over
              large baselines (100s of km).  As the U. S. does not currently have a satellite
              borne SAR sensor that provides global coverage while Western Europe, Canada and
              Japan do, WInSAR negotiated SAR data buys from ESA address a national
              deficiency in the short-term and create a cost-effective means of providing SAR
              imagery to the nation's geoscientists.  The NSF Division of Earth Sciences, the
              USGS and NASA co-support WinSAR data buys.
