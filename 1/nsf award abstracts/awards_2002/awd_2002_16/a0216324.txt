Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop
              photonic devices based on a new and proprietary family of rare earth oxide -
              aluminum oxide glasses, the real glasses, doped with Yb, Tm, and Er oxides.
              Phase I research showed exceptionally broad emission from Yb 3+, efficient
              energy transfer in co-doped glasses, and fluorescence lifetimes and spectra of
              Tm and Er that meet device requirements at high dopant concentrations.
              Feasibility of scaled-up production of the glasses was demonstrated. The Phase
              II activities include: collaboration with firms engaged in the glass and
              optical device business; scaled-up glass synthesis; optimization of dopant
              concentration and optical properties for devices; and construction and
              characterization of prototype laser devices.

Markets for optical device
              products are extremely large, multinational, and growing though expanded
              applications and displaced technologies. The Phase II R&D is focused on lasers,
              amplifiers, and optical devices for communications, laser surgery, and emerging
              military applications. The patent position and the absence of complex
              proprietary interests in the technology place this work in a strong commercial
              position.
