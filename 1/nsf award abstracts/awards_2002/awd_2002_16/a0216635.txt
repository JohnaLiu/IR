Abstract    :
              This award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program supports the
              acquisition an ultra-high resolution electron beam nanolithography system for
              research and education programs led by a multi-disciplinary team of
              investigators from physics, chemistry, electrical engineering, materials
              science, and biomedical engineering at the University of California, Irvine
              (UCI). The instrumentation will further enhance current research activities at
              UCI's Integrated Nanosystems Research Facility (INRF), currently serving over
              100 academic users in collaboration with over 50 companies (25 of whom are
              users) in order to support research in the nascent fields of nano-electronics,
              nano-fluidics, molecular electronics, nano-mechanics, and nano-biotechnology.
              The system will offer a unique capability to university, industry, and
              community researchers to (among other things) design and process novel
              materials and devices at the nanoscale such as molecular wires and devices,
              carbon nanotubes, and single-electron transistors, to investigate
              single-molecule chemistry, to investigate the use of nano-electronic devices
              with the preparation of nano-biological polymer materials, and to accomplish
              nano-bio tasks such as cell membrane signal transduction characterization and
              protein and DNA analysis and sequencing.
