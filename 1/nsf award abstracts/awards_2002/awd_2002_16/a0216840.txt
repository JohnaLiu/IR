Abstract    :
              This grant supports the purchase of an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber pumped by
              a turbomolecular drag pump. The chamber will have a mass spectrometer, an Auger
              electron spectrometer, and a reflection/absorption infrared spectrometer for
              analytical equipment. The chamber will also have an ion gauge, an ion gun, and
              a xyzq sample manipulator. The laboratory currently does not have access to a
              UHV chamber. Without a UHV chamber, the investigators can only observe the end
              products and the kinetics of their formation in a low-vacuum reactor. A UHV
              chamber allows determination of what intermediate species form on the surface,
              which in, turn, leads to a fuller understanding of the reactions. This is
              necessary for research to determine reaction pathways of b-diketones on various
              surfaces. With a deeper understanding of the reactions, the investigators can
              develop methods of cleanly etching surfaces such as nickel/iron alloys,
              alumina, and tungsten with b-diketones. 

This UHV chamber will permit the
              training of graduate and undergraduate students in UHV techniques and will
              provide new opportunities for students in UHV surface science. This project
              will greatly enhance the training of students in surface science at the
              University of Tulsa.
