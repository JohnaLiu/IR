This is a proposal submitted by Dr. Peter Arzberger
              requesting funds to establish a Pacific Rim and Grid Middleware Assembly
              (Network). To accomplish this, he requests the involvement of domain scientists
              and technologies in the Pacific Rim countries through a series of working
              meetings (3 in 2002, 1 in 2003, and 1 in 2004) to accelerate daily use of the
              GRID for advancing science.  The development and deployment of the East Asia
              GRID middleware and application network is critical for the cooperation in
              information technology between the U.S. and East Asia.  This effort will
              promote a regional collaboration in software development and form a partnership
              between the U.S. and key western Pacific Rim countries, such as Australia,
              China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand.  Efforts to promote this
              technology throughout Asia and the world could enhance the development of
              worldwide standards to make grid-enabled computing and resource sharing a
              reality.  The initial efforts will be supported jointly by the Chinese Academy
              of Science, Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information, the Taiwan
              National Science Council and NSF.
