Funding is requested for the development of a novel matrix
              assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass
              spectrometer. The goal of this development is to replace the conventional
              microchannel plate (MCP) detectors in an existing MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer
              by resonant nano-mechanical sensors to improve its mass spectrometric
              capabilities.

The proposed development will result in a room temperature
              MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer with very high mass resolution and sensitivity and
              practically no upper limit for detectable mass.  This is a much-needed
              analytical tool for chemical and biological sciences and offers prospects for
              studying many different macromolecules. It also appears that this will be the
              first application where nano-mechanical systems are being employed as
              ultra-fast sensors.
