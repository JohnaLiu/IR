Draine, Bruce T.

The Principal Investigator and his team will
              create a powerful parallel-processing facility for research in astrophysics on
              problems, which do not require "shared memory" or ultra-fast inter-processor
              communication.  Studies will include: Light scattering from irregular
              interstellar grains, cosmological structure formation, dynamical evolution of
              gaseous protoplanetary accretion disks, and several other compelling
              astronomical sciences research topics.  The system will contain 96 dual CPU
              "slave" systems with a total of 192 Central Processing Units, and 192 gigabytes
              of RAM with a 3.8 TB disk.
