Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Western Washington University will acquire a 500 MHz
              NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies
              on a) the total synthesis of allelopathic natural products and the preparation
              of medium ring ethers via phenol-epoxide cyclization reactions; b) synthesis
              and characterization of novel diamagnetic d10 metal isoindoline complexes; c)
              structural characterization of mutant proteins implicated in early-onset
              familial Alzheimer's disease; d) molecular recognition studies of neurosteroids
              important in a number of neurodegenerative diseases; e) structural
              characterization of circular permuteins of myoglobin to understand the
              folding-function relationship in oxygen transport proteins; and f) structural
              elucidation of novel sesquiterpenoid natural products.   

Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists
              for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify
              unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
              solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
              studies will have an impact in a number of areas including  molecular biology
              and medicinal chemistry.
