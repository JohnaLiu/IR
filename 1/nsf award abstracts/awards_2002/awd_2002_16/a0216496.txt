Funds from this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI)grant
              will be used to acquire a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer that
              will be housed in the Department of Geology at the University of Wisconsin at
              Eau Claire (UWEC).  The instrument will be equipped with a microscope
              attachment that will aid in the study of the kinetics of mineral growth and
              diffusion in natural geologic environments.  The FTIR facility will be the
              primary analytical tool for a variety of collaborative research projects with
              undergraduates at UWEC.  In particular, the instrument will be used in
              conjunction with funds secured by the Petrology Division at the NSF (award
              EAR-0126285) to investigate the nature of water-bearing impurities in
              hydrothermal quartz crystals  This research builds on previous contributions
              resulting from collaborative research with undergraduate students, including
              discerning the growth rate of natural crystals and the timing of thermal events
              in metamorphic processes.  The instrument will be the first of its kind
              available for academic use in an educational environment in all of northern and
              western Wisconsin.  The University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire will provide a 30%
              match for the cost of acquisition of the equipment and will further provide
              100% of the maintenance and upkeep costs of the instrument for the first five
              years after purchase.
