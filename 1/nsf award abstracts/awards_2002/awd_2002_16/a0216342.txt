Abstract    :
              This Major Research Instrumentation award to Old Dominion University in Virginia
              provides funds for acquisition of oceanographic instrumentation to outfit a
              55-foot coastal research vessel for research and education projects in and
              around the Chesapeake Bay.  Specific instrumentation to be acquired included a
              Conductivity-Temperature-Depth system (CTD), a precision depth recorder, an
              acoustic current profiler, a global positioning sytem, a box corer and a data
              logging computer system.  The award also included partial support of a marine
              technician to integrate, install and oversee operation of the instrumentation
              during the initial three years.  The project is supported by the Division of
              Ocean Sciences at NSF. Old Dominion University will provide cost-share support
              from non-federal funds for more than 30% of total project costs.
