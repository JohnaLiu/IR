Abstract    :
              The project will begin the development and demonstration of a new method to
              produce quantitative bounds on the risk that can be attributed to a set of
              environmental agents in circumstances in which conventional agent-by-agent
              "front-to-back" risk analysis produces results with extremely wide uncertainty
              bounds.  The method will begin by summarizing available toxicological and
              epidemiological evidence on the end-point(s) in a form that facilitates easy
              comparisons.  A constrained sum expert elicitation procedure will be developed
              which uses these data, together with expert judgment, to probabilistically
              attribute known and suspected causes of the health end-point to the observed
              cases. The result of this work should be a 
new set of methods which can be
              used by the risk analysis community in conjunction with more traditional risk
              analytic methods to bound the magnitude of possible health impacts from some
              types of environmental risks.
