Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase II project will continue the
              successful
work from the Phase I project and develop integrated
              amplifier/splitters through laser
direct writing of wet-chemically derived,
              erbium-doped coatings. Precursor solutions will
be mixed on the molecular
              level to produce pure and homogeneous materials. Waveguide
structures will be
              written into the erbium-doped fluoride coatings with a laser, which
raises its
              index of refraction to confine light. The erbium-doped channel waveguides
              will
be pumped with a 980 nm source to amplify 1550 nm signals.
Markets in
              which integrated optical devices, such as amplified splitters, can be
              used
total several $100 million. This device will expedite bringing fiber the
              last mile because
it will replace the current serial arrangement of discrete
              splitters and amplifiers, which
is bulky and expensive due to the number of
              components and interconnects. The proposed
integration techniques will also
              enable optical integrated circuits and next-generation
computing.
Prototypes
              will be fabricated during Phase II. TPL has extensive experience
              in
wet-chemical processing and demonstrated ability to commercialize its
              technologies. The PI
is a pioneering researcher of laser-fired, sol-gel
              derived films. LightPath Technologies
will assist TPL with device and
              marketing development.
