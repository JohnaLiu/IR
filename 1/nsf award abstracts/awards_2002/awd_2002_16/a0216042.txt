Abstract    :
              This Small Buisness Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the
              urgent need to improve control of the blast chemical reaction.  These blasts
              are produced by drilling boreholes into the overburden and filling them with an
              ammonium nitrate/fuel oil (ANFO) mixture.  These explosive charges are then
              ignited to push the overburden into a previously excavated trench.  This Phase
              II project will complete the design, fabrication, and testing of a prototype
              detonation system to be deployed in surface mining boreholes to preferentially
              initiate detonation of the powder column, thus insuring a high efficiency blast
              without the unwanted release of toxic air pollutants.

This project will lead
              to commercialization of a method of improving the efficiency and environmental
              quality of the cast blasting technique used by the surface mining.  The market
              for this detonation system is any mining that involves cast blasting, primarily
              the surface coal mining industry.  The United States is one of the two world
              leaders in coal production with nearly one billion tons of coal being produced
              in 2001.
