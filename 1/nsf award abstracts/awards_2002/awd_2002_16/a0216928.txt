Knowledge of the chemical compositions of rocks is essential
              for understanding Earth processes.  In particular, chemical analysis is a major
              part of the investigation of igneous rocks.  X-ray fluorescence is the primary
              workhorse technique providing accurate and precise analyses of the major
              chemical constituents of rocks, plus some important minor and trace elements. 
              Centralized analytical services have the benefit of being cost-effective, and
              of reducing noise from inter-laboratory discrepancies in the geochemical data
              used by the scientific community. The GeoAnalytical Lab at Washington State
              University has offered such a centralized XRF service for over two decades. 
              The current spectrometer has been in operation since 1987, and needs
              replacement.  This grant will enable the WSU Lab to purchase a new
              spectrometer, in order to continue to provide a reliable major- and
              trace-element analytical service to the geochemical community.  Installation of
              the new instrument will improve sample throughput and turnaround time, and
              significantly enhance data quality for some trace elements, as well as enabling
              the Lab to continue to provide a service for the next decade or more.
