Abstract    :
              This award, funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering, the
              Division of Environmental Biology's Biotic Surveys & Inventories Program, and
              the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems Program, supports preliminary
              research to study the dynamics of climate and land-use change in the tropical
              Andes region in Peru and Bolivia in collaboration with teams of researchers
              from the Universidad Nacional San Antonio Abad el Cusco, Universidad Nacional
              Agraria, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Herbario Nacional de
              Bolivia, Nacional Forestal Martin Cardenas, and Universidad Autonoma Gabriel
              Rene Moreno.

Data needed by climate, ecosystem, vegetation researchers, and
              species distribution modelers will be collected and analyzed to gain insight on
              how global and regional forces affect local biodiversity. It is anticipated
              that this work will facilitate interaction among a variety of research groups
              studying the Andes, and will provide general insight on the unique aspects of
              the Andean forests, the natural processes that produce and maintain life's
              diversity, and their conservation.
