Abstract    :
              This award funds the acquisition of an axial Servo Hydraulic Test System,
              consisting of a closed loop control-loading frame with the appropriate
              electronic interface. The specific Test System requested by this proposal is
              manufactured by MTS with the following components: 
Model 810.25, 220,000 lbs
              (1000 kN) System 
Model 505.60 (60 GPM, 3000 psi) Hydraulic Power Unit 
MTS
              TestStar IIm Digital Control System and Software 
MTS Load cell, COD gage,
              grips and testing fixtures
Desktop  Pentium III Computer

The test system
              provides a broad range of testing capability for performing load or
              displacement controlled testing. Testing capabilities include tension,
              compression, shear, flexural and cyclic testing of most materials and
              structural components. This test system was selected in order to fulfill the
              testing needs of not only the proposed research projects but also the current
              and future undergraduate and graduate laboratories in the area of materials and
              structural mechanics for the Civil and Mechanical Engineering programs at
              Clarkson University. 

The awarded equipment will be used in the following
              research activities:
-	Characterization of the Interfacial Crack Propagation
              in Reinforced Concrete Beams Strengthened by Externally Bonded FRP
              Laminates.
-	Time-Dependent Cleavage Fracture of Ice.
-	Conditions for
              Localized Deformation in Rock.
-	Testing of Composite Materials for Model
              Validation.

Acquisition of the testing system will also strengthen the
              following undergraduate and graduate courses at Clarkson University:
              Introduction to Design, CE212; Fracture Mechanics of Concrete Structures, CE
              401; Reinforced Concrete Design, CE 441; Structural Steel Design, CE 442;
              Advanced Design of Structural Concrete, CE 544; Manufacturing Processes, ME
              390; Analysis of Materials Processing, ME 393; and Composite Mechanics and
              Design, ME 457.

The awarded equipment will provide a critical enhancement to
              both the research capability and pedagogical scope of faculty as well as the
              relevant educational experiences of students. Moreover, these enhancements will
              affect students and faculty across several academic units as well as
              interdisciplinary work that cuts across customary departmental lines.
