MRI/MII: Acquisition of Collaborative High Performance Computing
              and Visualization Center

This proposal from an MII institution, establishing
              a Beowulf cluster for High Performance Computing (HPC) and visualization, aims
              at enabling, supporting, and enhancing research and education in modeling and
              simulation.  The main applications addressed use a variety of numerically
              intensive algorithms, which require many "runs" of a base computational
              algorithm in order to view the big picture.  Technical areas which will benefit
              from the infrastructure include enterprise modeling and simulation and
              visualization, high performance computing in areas such as PDE solvers and
              bioinformatics, control systems modeling, automatic speech recognition, and
              physical electronics simulations.  Current specific research activities at ODU
              include:
1. Modeling and Simulation Research,
2. A JSC Augmented Reality
              Trainer for International Space Station Space Lab Window Assembly,
3. Virtual
              Environments for Training,
4. VMASC Battle Lab (war gaming, human computer
              interfaces, visualization and distributed simulation)
5. Center for
              Computational Science,
6. Terascale Optimal PDE Simulations,
7.
              Bioinformatics,
8. Speech Communications Research,
9. Physical electronics
              simulations (Bio-electrics, Nanoelectronics, Lattice Boltzmann Simulations,
              and
10. Systems Research on Life Critical Control Systems.

The
              computational cluster will have approximately 50 nodes on the main campus and a
              number of similar notes at the modeling and simulation center in Suffolk. 
              Coupled via gigabit network and loosely coupled between the two subclusters,
              the machines within each local cluster will use public domain (e.g., Linux
              based) operating systems and scheduling such that computationally intensive
              investigations can be initiated from various locations.  The equipment will
              support faculty and student training providing hands-on experience in advanced
              computing research.
