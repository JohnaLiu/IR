Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Computational Science Research Center at San Diego State University will
              acquire a computer system consisting of  an Intel/Linux cluster and 4
              workstations.  This equipment will enhance research in the following areas:  a)
              calculation of structural and dynamical properties of reactive chemical
              intermediates with low-barrier mechanisms for chemical transformation; b)
              development of numerical integration techniques for application to oceanic flow
              patterns around static objects; c) modeling of protein-protein docking as a
              component in iterative protein design techniques; d) development and testing of
              mathematical models of flame dynamics; e) simulation of collisions between
              different planets and between planets and their suns; f) calculation of
              dynamical properties in quantum fluids; and g) three-dimensional mapping of
              mitochondrial structures and associated statistical analysis.  

A cluster of
              fast, modern computer workstations is vital to serving the computing needs of
              active research departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as a
              development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides
              state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities, and supports research
              in state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing.  These studies will
              have a significant impact in a wide number of areas, including biochemistry,
              ocean sciences, drug development, combustion chemistry, astronomy, and
              materials sciences.
