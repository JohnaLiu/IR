Abstract    :
              This Major Research Instrumentation RUI grant supports acquisition of a desk top
              x-ray diffractometer that will be used in materials science and solid-state
              chemistry research at Jackson State University, an undergraduate,
              teaching-oriented university. This diffractometer does not require water
              cooling and is sufficiently simple that undergraduate students can use it after
              a short training period.  The diffractometer will be used in teaching
              laboratories as well as in research. The research is varied. One example is
              exploring new forms of silicon, including amorphous silicon that contains on
              the order of 40% molecular hydrogen. New open framework structures such as
              silicon-germanium and tin clathrates will also be characterized.

This
              equipment will see shared use with the University of Alabama at Birmingham and
              Auburn University. It should enhance the on-going collaborations between the
              three universities. The equipment will also be used as a demonstration tool for
              high school students in collaboration with a program called "Alabama Science in
              Motion" and will be employed in the continuing education Masters Program for
              local high school teachers.
