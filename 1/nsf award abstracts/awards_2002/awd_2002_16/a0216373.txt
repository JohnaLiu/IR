Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is focused on
              designing a series of extremely efficient metal extraction products (MEPs) with
              tailor-made properties for specifically extracting and purifying platinum group
              metal (PGM) anions from acid solutions. Existing PGM recovery and separation
              methods are complex and expensive. The Phase II project will fully develop the
              separation and purification of PGMs, scale up the MEP synthesis and expand the
              scope of the work to launch the technology into PGM recycling market. 
    
              These novel MEPs will have wide applications in the precious metal refining as
              well as recycling industries. It is estimated that the total value of precious
              metal catalysts in spent automobile catalytic reactors in the United States
              alone is $ 800 million a year. Additionally, these MEPs could also be used in
              the separation and purification of actinides, such as plutonium, and in the
              pre-concentration of trace amounts of anions (e.g. chromate, arsenate) to aid
              in environmental analysis. Modifications of the structure may also lead to the
              production of highly specific environmental sensors for the in-situ detection
              of contaminants in groundwater and other aqueous streams.
