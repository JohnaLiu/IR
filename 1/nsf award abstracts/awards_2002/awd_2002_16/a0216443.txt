Abstract    :
              This award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program will enable the
              Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at The University of Texas in Austin
              to acquire a Raman microscope/nanoscope.  With these new capabilities, faculty
              will carry out the following investigations:  a) semiconductor materials
              characterization; b) quantum confinement in group IV nanostructures; c)
              compositional studies of advanced photoresists; d) nanoscale compositional
              mapping of nanostructured materials for electrochemical energy
              conversion/storage; e) light-emitting polymers; f) characterization of polymer
              micelles adsorbed on surfaces; g) the nanomechanics and interphase chemistry of
              interfacial fracture; and h) Raman imaging as a diagnostic probe for cervical
              cancer.

Optical and electron microscopy have informed essentially every area
              of modern science and technology whereas the vibrational spectroscopies
              (infrared and Raman) have been the most incisive probes of structure and
              bonding in molecules and solids.  Recent developments in vibrational microscopy
              have made it possible to characterize materials on the micron and submicron
              length scales, probing, for example, chemical composition, crystalline phase,
              microcrystallite orientation and stress in both homogeneous and heterogeneous
              samples.  Raman microscopy has very high intrinsic spatial resolution, and
              sample preparation is minimal.  These studies will have a strong impact in a
              wide variety of fields including microelectronics, optoelectronics and polymer
              science.
