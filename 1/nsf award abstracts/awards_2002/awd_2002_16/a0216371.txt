Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Center for Laser and Optical Spectroscopy at the University of Akron will
              acquire a femtosecond/picosecond laser for ultrafast spectroscopic probes of
              the structure and excited state dynamics of molecular systems.  This equipment
              will enhance research in the following areas:  1) time-resolved optical
              spectroscopy of novel nanoscale, porphyrin-containing, dendritic photosynthetic
              mimics; 2) equilibrium geometries and excited-state dynamics of aromatic
              clusters; 3) real-time measurements of intramolecular vibration-energy
              redistribution (IVR) in OH-containing molecules; and 4) time-resolved optical
              spectroscopy of unusual porphyrins.


A femtosecond/picosecond laser
              provides ultrafast pulses of coherent visible or infrared light, which enables
              researchers to obtain important information about fast occurring chemical
              reactions.  Its use may enable breakthroughs in our understanding of the
              properties of reactive and nonreactive molecules.  This laser system will be
              available to researchers from a number of neighboring universities and colleges
              in Ohio.
