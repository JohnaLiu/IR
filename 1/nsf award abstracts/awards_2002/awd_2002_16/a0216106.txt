Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project continue the
              development and commercialization of novel plasma display panels which utilize
              gas filled microspheres (Plasma-spheres) as the pixel elements. The project has
              six objectives: (a) improve process control of the Plasma-sphere production
              system, (b) produce Plasma-spheres with optimum properties and characteristics,
              (d) develop reliable microsphere-electrode configurations, (e) develop a
              semi-automated process for fabricating Plasma-sphere panels,  (f) construct and
              evaluate prototype plasma-sphere panels, and  (g) determine techniques for a
              fully automated production process. The Plasma-spheres will be produced with a
              prototype production system built in Phase I. The Plasma-sphere panels will be
              characterized for operating voltages, current and brightness. As part of the
              prototype panel construction a reliable method of applying the Plasma-spheres
              to substrates will be developed. 

The use of Plasma-spheres will
              dramatically increase manufacturing throughput, reduce materials cost by half,
              and eliminate many process steps and expensive specialized machinery which are
              part of the current plasma panel technology. These cost reductions along with
              new applications which will result from the availability of an open flexible
              substrate (e.g., large conformal and panoramic displays), will provide
              Plasma-sphere panels with a significant competitive edge
