This project will equip the University of
              Virginia's Fan mountain observatory with a state-of-the-art infrared imager.
              Graduate and undergraduate students will design and build the instrument, which
              is based on a 1024x1024 HgCdTe Rockwell Science Center "HAWAII" array to
              provide sensitivity to 2.5 micrometers wavelength. In addition to broad and
              narrow-band imaging capabioity the camera design includes a low resolution
              (R~300) grism-based spectrographic mode. The completed system will be used for
              several scientific applications, including 1.variability studies of young
              stellar objects, 2. Spectral classification studies of brown dwarfs,
              parallax/proper motion measurements of brown dwarfs, 3. Classification and
              variability studies of asymptotic giant branch stars, and 4 rotational
              mineralogy studies of asteriods and near-earth objects.
