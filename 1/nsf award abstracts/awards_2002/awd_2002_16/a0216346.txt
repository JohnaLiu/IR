Researchers at UC-Davis have recently developed a technique
              that uses  partial hysteresis curves to determine the distribution of magnetic
              properties within a material.  The method probes the microscopic mechanisms of
              magnetic behavior in greater detail than is possible with major hysteresis
              loops or with conventional magnetometry.  This Major Research Instrumentation
              grant will provide funding for a combined Alternating Field Gradient and
              Vibrating Sample Magnetometer with high magnetic field and low temperature
              capabilities. The instrument will allow researchers to look at a much wider
              variety of materials under a much broader range of conditions than can be done
              presently.  These enhanced experimental capabilities will lead to new advances
              in paleomagnetism, rock and mineral magnetism and environmental magnetism as
              well as new insights into condensed matter physics, particularly synthetic
              magnetic materials and magnetic nanostructures.
