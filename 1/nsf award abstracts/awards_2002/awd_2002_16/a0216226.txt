Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Biosphere 2 Center at Columbia University will acquire a Proton Transfer
              Reaction Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS) and a gas chromatography-time of flight
              mass spectrometer (GC-TOFMS) to support a collaborative, interdisciplinary
              research agenda in chemical ecology and biosphere-atmosphere chemistry. This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including a)
              investigations of host-plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and CO2
              emissions in insect neurobiology; b) analysis of chemical communication and
              defense in a pantropical ant; c) on-line measurements of biosphere-atmosphere
              chemistry influenced by plant emission of VOCs; d) understanding the role of
              plant-emitted isoprene in (insect) chemical ecology; and e) ion mobility
              spectroscopy development.  

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to
              probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a
              vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The results
              from these studies will have an impact in a number of areas including chemical
              ecology and atmospheric sciences.
