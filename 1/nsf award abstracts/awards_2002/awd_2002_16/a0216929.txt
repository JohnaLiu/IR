Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Phase II project is directed toward optimizing
              and scaling up fabrication of exchange coupled Fe/ceramic nanocomposites for
              high performance soft magnetic applications. In Phase I, Inframat  Corporation
              took pioneering steps to develop Fe/ceramic magnetic nanocomposites, which
              resulted in significant improvements over microsized ferrites including higher
              saturation magnetization and lower power loss. The design of the Fe/ceramic
              nanocomposite is based on an exchange coupling effect between neighboring
              nanoparticles, where Fe nanoparticles are uniformly distributed within an
              insulating ceramic matrix. Successful Phase I efforts have provided the
              scientific and technological groundwork for further magnetic nanocomposite
              technology advancement in Phase II. The proposed Phase II program scales-up the
              Fe/ceramic nanocomposite technology performed in Phase I. Emphasis is on rapid
              commercialization of nanocomposite cores. Key Phase II milestones include (1)
              scale-up of the demonstrated chemical synthesis into pilot-scale production,
              (2) demonstration of prototype cores having desirable magnetic properties
              through exchange coupling, and (3) demonstration of high performance prototype
              DC-to-DC converters using the exchange coupled magnetic nanocomposite
              cores.

Phase II participants include Ceramic Magnetics, UConn, Villanova
              Univ., Georgia Tech, and a converter specialist, Colonel William McLyman.
              Ceramic Magnetics has pledged $75,000 cost share to the Phase II and will carry
              a $250,000 follow-on funding.
