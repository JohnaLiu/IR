Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and
              commercialize an ultra fast block data retrieval method for the company's
              patented chiral film-based optical data storage system.  The technology will
              combine ultrahigh storage capacity with ultra fast retrieval speed.  The
              current retrieval rates of CD-ROM, DVD-ROM and MO technology is inherently
              limited for applications such as image retrieval for medical diagnosis or
              target recognition.  The company's block retrieval technique is a new method
              for solving the bottleneck of data retrieval.  Using imaging and pattern
              recognition techniques, data is retrieved in 2D blocks.  This retrieval method
              will result in orders-of-magnitude increases in throughput and increases in
              storage density.

Since the need for high density, high-speed storage is
              continuing to escalate, there will be a ready market from storage system
              vendors who supply products to the myriad of industries whose business depends
              upon volumes of storage and quick retrieval.
