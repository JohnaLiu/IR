Abstract    :
              With support from theMajor Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Simmons College  will acquire a Matrix-assisted
              Laser Desorption Ionization - Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometer. 
              This instrument will be used in a wide variety of studies, including a) the
              development and testing of organic light emitting diodes; and b) the
              investigation of cell signaling proteins associated with the activation of B
              lymphocytes in the humoral immune system.  

Matrix-assisted laser desorption
              ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry is the technique of
              choice for obtaining accurate molecular weights on molecules up to and over
              300,000 daltons, with extremely high sensitivity.  Use of a MALDI-TOF mass
              spectrometer has therefore become a standard technique in most DNA/protein core
              facilities.  The ability to obtain very accurate molecular weights of
              biological molecules is fundamental to all biological and biomedical research
              and essential in a modern research and training environment.  Simmons College
              is a member of the Colleges of the Fenway consortium of six neighboring
              colleges.  One of these colleges, Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health
              Sciences, will also benefit from the use of the proposed instrument.
