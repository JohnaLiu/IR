Abstract    :
              This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program to the
              University of Washington supports the acquisition of a solid phase peptide
              synthesizer, and a triple channel CPMAS probe. The instrument will provide new
              NMR capability to the university. It will have impact in the area of molecular
              engineering, in characterization of biomolecules immobilized at material
              surfaces, in atomic level information on the structure of biopolymers adsorbed
              onto material surfaces and the details of protein side chain-surface
              interactions.
