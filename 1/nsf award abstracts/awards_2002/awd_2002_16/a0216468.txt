Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Ryan S.
              Winburn and John R. Webster of Minot State University will acquire an X-ray
              diffractometer.  The research projects to be undertaken with this instrument
              include a) examination of instrumental factors affecting the accuracy of
              Rietveld quantitative X-ray diffraction; b) structure solution of materials; c)
              quantitative mineralogical analysis of volcanic rocks as part of petrologic
              research; d) determination of structural parameters of volcanic rocks; e)
              quantitative mineralogical analysis and determination of structural parameters
              in solid solutions for heavy mineral separates from North Dakota sandstones;
              and f) clay mineralogy of river embankment slopes to determine correlation with
              stability.  

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise
              measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including
              bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about the
              spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. 
              These studies will have a strong impact in geochemistry.
