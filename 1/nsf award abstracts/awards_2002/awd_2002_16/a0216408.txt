NSF-MRI Abstract:
A grant
              has been awarded to Dr. Ken Belanger at Colgate University for the development
              of a fluorescence light microscopy facility to be used for research and
              undergraduate education. This award will allow the acquisition of four 
              fluorescence light microscopes and accompanying high-resolution digital
              cameras, as well as a variable temperature, stage-mounted incubation chamber.
              This instrumentation will be used for faculty and student research projects as
              well as investigative teaching laboratory exercises in the Biology, Geology,
              and Neuroscience Departments at both Colgate University and Hamilton
              College.

The fluorescence microscopy facility funded by this proposal will
              initially support six research projects and seven undergraduate laboratory
              courses, and will be available for use by faculty members and laboratory
              courses not included in the original proposal. The research projects outlined
              in this proposal address a broad range of questions across a variety of
              disciplines, including examination of intracellular protein targeting
              (Belanger, project 1), Antarctic paleogeology (Leventer, project 2),
              dopamine-induced neuromodulation (Tierney, project 3), gene expression at
              temperature extremes (Hoopes, project 4), steroid hormone regulation of
              neurotransmission (Lehman, project 5), and intracellular signal transmission
              (Festin, project 6). In addition, the microscopy facility will be used for
              educational purposes for seven different laboratory courses (project 7),
              including Cell Biology, Environmental Studies, Genetics, Molecular Analysis,
              Neurophysiology, and Developmental Biology. Based on current research
              activities and course enrollments, approximately 30 independent research
              students and 180 - 200 lab course participants will utilize this microscopy
              facility annually. Thus, this facility will not only serve to enhance the
              quality of research performed within this consortium, but will also enhance the
              educational experience, technological preparedness, and enthusiasm for
              continued scientific research for a significant number of undergraduate
              students.
