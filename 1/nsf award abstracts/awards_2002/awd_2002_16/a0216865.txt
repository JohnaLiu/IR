Abstract    :
              The funds provided by the NSF Instrumentation for Materials Research program
              support Michigan State university with the acquisition of a unique
              micro-compounding molding system to support research in emerging new bio-based
              materials and polymers, and related educational programs. The equipment will be
              used in support of research which includes: (i) investigation of fundamental
              phenomena in newly developed bio-based materials and polymers, (ii)
              optimization of processing parameters at the micro-scale - - to establish
              structure, property, and performance relations and (iii) expansion of the
              integration of research and education in the area of polymer blending, polymer
              compounding and nanocomposites.
