Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase (SBIR) II project will further
              develop ELEX (Electro-Extrusion) which is a manufacturing process for
              prototyping and batch manufacturing high-aspect ratio microelectromechanical
              systems (MEMS) and related microparts and microstructures.  The goal is to
              replace (in many applications) the so-called LIGA process, which is an
              electrodeposition-based technique, requiring the use of a clean room and
              synchrotron. 

The commercialization potential of this project to the MEMS
              industry will provide a dramatic reduction in cost and time, which will greatly
              accelerate the commercialization of MEMS and other microscale devices.
