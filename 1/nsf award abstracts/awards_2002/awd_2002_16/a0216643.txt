This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of
              California at San Diego  provides funds for acquisition of an isotope ratio
              mass spectrometer for shared use in studies of climate and global climate
              change, ocean sciences and anthropology at the Scripps Institution of
              Oceanography and other UCSD departments.  The award is supported by the
              Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF.  UCSD will provide cost-share support from
              non-federal funds for 33% of total project costs.
