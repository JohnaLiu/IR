Abstract    :
              This grant supports the acquisition of a BRUKER IFS 66v/S Fourier Transform (FT)
              Raman and Infrared (IR) spectrometer. The optics bench of the instrument has
              rapid FT Raman, FTIR (far IR to near visible) and photoluminescence measurement
              capabilities. This instrument is configured for spectral analysis of
              micron-sized samples with the help of the Ramanscope and IR scope attachments.
              The FT Raman and IR spectrometer will assist current research activities on
              carbon nanotubes, thermoelectrics, photonics and biomaterials. The instrument
              will be used to enhance laboratory experience to students enrolled in
              spectroscopy courses taught at Clemson University. 

Raman and infrared are
              two forms of vibrational spectroscopy that yield complementary information of
              chemical substances. Both of these are used extensively in materials, physics,
              chemistry and biological sciences. The instrument brings unique research
              capabilities to teaching institutions in South Carolina by providing a
              well-equipped, interdisciplinary learning facility that will be used to train
              undergraduate and graduate students in the use of next generation equipment for
              materials research. It will facilitate joint research projects between faculty
              members engaged in interdisciplinary research fields.
