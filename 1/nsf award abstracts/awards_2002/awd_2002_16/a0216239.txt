Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Prof. R.
              Graham Cooks of Purdue University will develop a state-of-the-art Kingdon trap
              mass spectrometer for high performance chemical and biochemical analysis.  This
              instrument represents a fundamentally new approach to high accuracy/precision
              mass measurements.  In addition, its performance should be equivalent to a
              Fourier Transform-Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR) instrument, which is
              considerably more expensive.  

The project will impact the education of a
              number of graduate students and postdoctoral associates at Purdue, who will
              work directly to develop the instrument or will be involved in its testing.  A
              set of short courses in biological instrumentation will also be offered.
