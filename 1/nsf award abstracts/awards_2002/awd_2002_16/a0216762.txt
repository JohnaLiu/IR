This project studies the interaction between culture,
              activity-related expertise about the natural world, and the structure, content
              and intra-community distribution of folk biological knowledge. The study
              community is the Tzotzil Maya township of Zinacantan, Chiapas, Mexico. The
              research will explore the effects of the many economic and social changes that
              have occurred in the community in recent times on the distribution and content
              of folk biological knowledge. Several sets of formal tasks will be accomplished
              exploring the content, organization and distribution of knowledge about plants
              and animals as well as local religious rituals. In addition the PI will engage
              in ethnographic studies of daily life, informal interviews and surveys.  The
              results will be compared with data from previous studies, to assess the changes
              (any observed loss of factual knowledge about the environment will be compared
              to any observed loss of religious knowledge). This research will contribute to
              our understanding of the nature of cognitive models in human populations, their
              stability and sources of variability. The wider impacts will include the
              training of local students in social science research methods.
