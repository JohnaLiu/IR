Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop the
              Local Electrode Atom Probe (LEAP) to rapidly provide three-dimensional
              atomic-scale imaging and elemental identification of nano-biotechnology
              devices. Structural characterization of nano-biotechnology devices is currently
              problematic because available microscopy and analytical techniques have
              substantial limitations in quantitative imaging at the atomic-scale. Moreover,
              current microscopy techniques cannot adequately resolve three-dimensional
              biomacromolecules, which are intrinsic to nano-biotechnology devices. Until
              better analytical instrumentation is developed, researchers will "fly blind" as
              they develop more complex nano-biotechnology devices. The overall goal of this
              Phase II project is to rapidly analyze the three-dimensional atomic-scale
              structure and elemental composition of biological and organic molecules on
              nano-biotechnology devices. The focus will be on developing technologies to 
              analyze commercial specimens using LEAP technology, and to initiate
              commercialization and marketing of this technology to academic and industrial
              researchers.
     The commercial application of this project will be in the
              area of bioanalytical instrumentation and nano-biotechnology devices.
