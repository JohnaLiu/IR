Over a three year instrument development program, a new
              generation of noninvasive quantitative three-dimensional microscopy technology
              specialized for longitudinal (nondestructive) studies of development and gene
              expression in small animals will be developed. This instrument will integrate
              recent developments in optical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical coherence
              microscopy (OCM), which employ cutting-edge ultrahigh-bandwidth optical
              communications technologies for micron-scale resolution non-contact imaging in
              translucent materials including living biological tissues.
