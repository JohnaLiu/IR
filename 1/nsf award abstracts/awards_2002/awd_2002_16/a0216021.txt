Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR)Phase II project will develop full
              waveform models and minimal sensor algorithms for the General Dynamics -
              Advanced Technology Systems (GDATS) eddy current sensor (ECS).  These
              algorithms will enable the practical real-time high performance health
              monitoring for turbine engines.  Current processing techniques could require
              four or more sensors; however, these approaches do not make use of all the
              information made available by the ESC.  Using the full ECS signature, it is
              possible, in theory, to estimate integral vibration frequency, phase and
              amplitude using only a single sensor.  The reduction of the number of sensors
              required in each engine stage could potentially save millions of dollars over
              the life of the engine.

There are no systems commercially available today
              for continuous health monitoring of gas turbine engines.  Once in use, this
              system will allow pilots to react immediately to critical engine health
              problems thus avoiding potentially catastrophic engine failures and loss of
              lives.  The minimal sensor algorithms for continuous health monitoring have a
              large market spanning the aviation industry, as well as the rapidly expanding
              power industry.
