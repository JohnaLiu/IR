Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at making
              Photovoltaic (PV) solar electric power more affordable to our nation and to the
              world.  The technology in this program, represents a new process for the
              manufacturing of  cadmium Telluride (CdTe) solar cells. In this process the
              contact layers of copper-doped tellurium nanoparticles are sprayed on rather
              than sputtered, which promises to be a more efficient method of manufacturing. 
              The successful CdTe solar cell prototype will be designed with input from
              potential end-users as a means of increasing the likelihood for
              commercialization. 
     It is anticipated that this process will result in
              solar cells with superior initial and long-term efficiencies. Such improvements
              in performance could result in reduced costs for solar cell manufacturing
              ($/W), higher power during operation (kW-h/yr), and an extension of the useful
              lifetime - three aspects that will allow solar energy to be more competitive
              with existing methods for electric power production.
