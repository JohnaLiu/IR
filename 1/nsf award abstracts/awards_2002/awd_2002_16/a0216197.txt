A group of investigators at Duke University and North
              Carolina State University request funding to purchase an imaging X-ray
              photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) for the shared use of faculty. This request is
              motivated by an urgent need for contemporary surface analysis tools, especially
              XPS, in the research of participating faculty and the lack of such
              instrumentation currently at Duke University or in the Research Triangle area
              for shared use. The proposed Axis Ultra (Kratos Analytical Inc.) instrument
              allows XPS of both conductors and insulators with an energy resolution of <1 eV
              and a spatial resolution of ~10 um. This instrument will be used by the
              research groups of nine faculty at Duke University in the following
              departments: Biomedical Engineering (Chilkoti, Reichert and Truskey), Chemistry
              (Craig, Grinstaff, Liu, and Pirrung), Materials Science and Engineering
              (Zauscher), and Electrical Engineering (Massoud). In addition, two faculty at
              North Carolina State University in Chemical Engineering (Genzer) and Chemistry
              (Gorman) are also core investigators in this proposal, because of their
              pressing need for high spatial- and energy-resolution XPS in their research.
              The instrument will be located in the Shared Materials Instrumentation Facility
              in the Levine Science Research Center at Duke University, and will be used in
              diverse projects that require high spatial and energy resolution XPS.
