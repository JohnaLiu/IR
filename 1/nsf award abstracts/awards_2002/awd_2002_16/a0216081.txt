Faculty at UPRM involved in biotechnology and related
              areas have access to the Department of Biology Microscopy Center (DBMC),
              located in the Physics Building, which houses a scanning electron microscope
              (SEM) and a fluorescent microscope.  The addition of a confocal laser
              microscope to the DBMC would provide a new state-of-the-art microscopy
              visualization tool to the life sciences and biotechnology research community at
              UPRM and the island of Puerto Rico.
