Abstract    :
              This project solicits support to acquire a state-of-the-art fluorine laser to be
              used in laboratory studies of atmospheric processes. SRI International will
              host this laser system in a modern laser laboratory that will be made available
              to the atmospheric research community as a shared facility. With this system,
              large quantities of oxygen atoms can be generated under conditions with a low
              concentration of residual oxygen molecules. These conditions mimic those in the
              upper atmosphere of the Earth and will permit the study of collisional
              processes that would be difficult or impossible to study with other methods.
              This laser will make possible a series of laboratory studies addressing
              important unresolved problems in the fields of aeronomy and atmospheric
              science.
