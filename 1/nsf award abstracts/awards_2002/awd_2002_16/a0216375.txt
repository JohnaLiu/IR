MRI/RUI:
               Acquisition of Computational Modeling Facilities for Research and  Education
              in Engineering

This proposal from an REU institution, advancing the
              computational infrastructure of the institution (TCNJ) in Engineering, aims at
              improving the areas of computer aided design and numerical modeling (structural
              and thermal fluids) in both research and education. Three high performance
              workstations with 3-D graphics and visualization capabilities and expanded
              dynamic memory are requested along with licenses and training for two industry
              finite element modeling packages. The proposal addresses two strategic areas of
              national importance:

  High Performance Computing and
  Advanced Materials
              and Processing.

The former will be addressed through the infrastructure and
              training aspects; while the latter will be addressed through the research of
              the following topics:
  Numerical Study of Transient and Interfacial Effects
              in Physical Vapor Transport and
  Process Modeling of the Warm Forming of
              Aluminum.
Modeling will be done using commercial code such as ANSYS and
              FLUENT. Education and training activities are also planned. The project also
              addresses educational outreach and curriculum integration opportunities.
              

The funds requested include the equipment listed below and associated
              expenses.
  Sun Blade 1000 workstations
  ANSYS RFD upgrade license
  FIDAP
              and Exceed software
  Training for maintaining the packages

The equipment
              will support educational outreach programs and will be integrated with the
              curriculum to involve high school student, undergraduates and underrepresented
              groups.
