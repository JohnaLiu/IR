Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project concerns the
              development of an optical alloy composition sensor based on laser induced
              plasma spectroscopy. A key element of the sensor is the use of a microchip
              laser excitation source.  The technology has the capability to detect
              industrially relevant compositions in steel alloys and possibly aluminum
              alloys.  The Phase I results indicated the efficacy of the technique for the
              analysis of iron alloys. The Phase II project will focus on the development of
              a small, lightweight and mobile field prototype, which will be able to analyze
              various alloy samples.

The key commercial application of this technology is
              aluminum and iron scrap metal analysis, substantial market niches which are not
              effectively covered by existing analysis
technology.  The major market is for
              steel and aluminum alloys that have significant components of light elements. 
              These precision instrument currents have sales worldwide in excess of $10
              million per year.
