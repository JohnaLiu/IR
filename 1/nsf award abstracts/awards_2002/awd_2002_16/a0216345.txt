Abstract    :
              A heavy-ion tracking system is being developed by the University of North
              Florida to support nuclear astrophysics research at the Superconducting
              Accelerator Laboratory of the Florida State University (FSU).  The tracking
              system consists of two identical ion detectors and is modeled after a focal
              plane detector system implemented at the Fragment Mass Analyzer of the Argonne
              National Laboratory.  In each detector, a thin plastic foil emits delta
              electrons when a heavy ion passes through it.  The delta electrons are
              accelerated away from the foil toward an electron "mirror" which reflects the
              electrons toward a stack of micro channel-plate electron multipliers. The
              detector system will provide position and direction information on heavy ions
              incident at rates up to approximately one million per second.  The system will
              be used to track ion species generated by the exotic(radioactive) beam
              facility, RESOLUT, at FSU.  The initial goal of the RESOLUT research program is
              to study nuclear reactions that are important in
models of stellar nova
              explosions.  Undergraduate students will participate in all aspects of this
              project.
