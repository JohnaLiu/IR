This project seeks support for the acquisition of a
              portable, large-scale visualization system in order to improve the state-of-the
              art in nondestructive evaluation (NDE) processes. In particular, the project
              will employ virtual reality technology for:

(a) Defect characterization of
              NDE signals
(b) Virtual prototyping of NDE systems.

The project involves a
              collaborative effort among the following constituencies:

(a) Faculty and
              technicians
(b) Undergraduate and graduate students
(c) Industrial
              affiliates

The focus of the project is to create procedures for rapid
              deployment of VR
technology in the NDE industry. This research project
              supports and enhances existing collaborative research activity at Rowan
              University's NDE laboratory and a local NDE research & development company.
