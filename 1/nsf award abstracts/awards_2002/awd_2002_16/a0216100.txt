Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will replace
              current environmentally damaging metal pretreatment processes with an
              environmentally benign process whereby the metal surface is etched then coated
              with a sub-micron film of plasma polymerized SiO2. Current metal pretreatment
              processes for painting and adhesive  bonding perform well, but generate
              tremendous volumes of wastes, including hexavalent chromium and various
              inorganic acids. To obtain performance superior to the current state-of-the-art
              wet chemical surface treatments, the surface chemistry and morphology of the
              plasma polymerized films need to be tailored for specific interactions with the
              adhesive. Effects of variables including substrate chemistry, monomer
              chemistry, and ion kinetic energy on surface chemistry and morphology of plasma
              polymers will be determined. Then, the effect of the resulting structure on the
              strength and durability of adhesive joints will be determined.

By combining
              in-situ analytical techniques with accelerated aging and mechanical testing of
              adhesive specimens, a superior, environmentally benign process based on plasma
              polymerization will be developed and commercialized. These primers will have
              well understood morphologies and surface compositions tailored to the adhesive
              chemistry through control of the deposition conditions and/or chemical
              derivitization of the plasma polymer surface.
