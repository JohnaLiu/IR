Abstract    :
              This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of California at San
              Diego  provides funds for developments that will improve the capabilities of
              eighty ocean bottom seismometers operated by Scripps Institution of
              Oceanography as part of the NSF-funded national Ocean Bottom Seismometer
              Instrument Pool.  The seismometers will be outfitted with rechargeable battery
              packs, radio beacons for location during recovery, and Ethernet cards with
              flash memory to improve data downloading, and reduce noise and power
              consumption.  The award is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF. 
              Scripps Institution will provide cost-share support from non-federal funds for
              more than 30% of equipment costs.
