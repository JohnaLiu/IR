              Abstract - CAREER: Distributed Multi-Objective Optimization for the Construction
              of Large-Scale Transportation Systems 
Recent applications of
              performance-based contracting methods in the construction of transportation
              systems present decision makers in the construction industry with new and
              serious challenges that require: (1) optimizing the utilization of construction
              resources to satisfy multiple and conflicting contractual objectives; (2)
              solving large-scale construction optimization problems; and (3) maintaining
              optimality for the developed plans in a dynamic construction environment.
              
This CAREER project addresses these new and vital challenges using an
              integrated research and education plan. The research plan focuses on the
              development of an innovative Information Technology Framework for Optimizing
              Construction Utilization of Resources in Transportation Systems, named
              IT-FOCUS. The main research objectives of IT-FOCUS are to: (a) develop robust
              multi-objective optimization models; (b) formulate scalable methodologies for
              solving large-scale optimization problems; and (c) explore dynamic frameworks
              for revising optimal plans whenever and wherever needed. The education plan
              promotes the education of optimization and information technology in
              construction engineering and management. The main objectives of this plan are
              to: (a) incorporate research developments into new and existing courses; (b)
              use IT-FOCUS as an effective educational tool; (c) expand student advising and
              mentoring activities; (e) increase participation of students from
              underrepresented groups; and (f) disseminate research findings to the
              construction engineering community.   
The integrated research and education
              plan provides promising broad impacts on construction engineering research,
              construction education, and society. First, the research developments have
              strong potential to advance knowledge in distributed multi-objective
              optimization of construction resources. Second, the educational activities will
              enhance the education of construction optimization and IT for undergraduate and
              graduate students. Third, the societal benefits of optimizing the utilization
              of construction resources in transportation systems include: improving cost
              effectiveness of public expenditures on these systems, accelerating the
              revitalization of aging transportation facilities, minimizing
              construction-related service disruptions, improving construction quality and
              safety, and reducing negative impacts of construction on the environment.
