Abstract    :
              More than three hundred genomes have been sequenced in the last decade.  A new
              self-trained gene prediction program that can be applied to any eukaryotic
              genome will be developed.  The method builds the required training set in three
              steps, beginning with a seed set from existing resources for transcribed
              regions.  The set is extended and combined with a structure model into a
              complete gene finder.  The performance will be evaluated on the reference
              organism, Toxoplasma gondii, which has both draft sequence and EST sequences. 
              The eukaryotic genomes provide information that will be of benefit in both
              economic and health considerations.  As the coupling between different
              disciplines grows strong, a more interdisciplinary educational structure will
              be needed.  The education aspects of this effort will address this at both
              undergraduate and graduate levels.
