Abstract    :
              The research component of this CAREER project involves global three-dimensional
              (3-D) modeling of the tropospheric chemistry of ozone and mercury.
              Specifically, the PI will address long-range transport of ozone and its
              precursors across the North Pacific and will compare modeling results with data
              from various ground-based and airborne field campaigns. This work will provide
              a systematic examination of meteorological/chemical mechanisms leading to
              long-range transport events, as well as case studies of trans-Pacific pollution
              transport events. The second project will apply the same model, augmented by a
              newly developed mercury module, to study sources, chemical transformation, and
              long-range transport of mercury.

The educational activities will include the
              development of web based course material, the design of a new project-based
              graduate class in atmospheric chemistry modeling, mentoring of graduate and
              undergraduate students, and participation in mentoring programs at the PI's
              institution for women graduate students in science and engineering.
