Abstract    :
              Intellectual Merit

Design in power-limited scaling era. This proposal
              presents a general framework of minimization of power and energy in digital
              CMOS integrated circuits. This proposal presents a framework for designing
              digital circuits to either minimize power/energy dissipation for given
              performance or maximize the performance under power/energy constraints. The
              problem is defined at the circuit level, but is also expanded to include the
              device, microarchitecture and system levels.

This framework will be used in
              designing signal processing blocks for communications and storage systems. The
              particular applications targeted are iterative decoders for turbo and
              low-density parity check decoding.


Broader Impacts

The broader impacts
              of this proposed project are twofold: 1) to widen the education in digital
              integrated circuits including power, energy, as well as robustness as key
              determining variables within digital integrated circuit designs and 2) to
              include these areas within the revised edition of a widely used textbook in
              Digital Integrated Circuit. My education plans aim at providing a solid
              analytical background and design intuition for our students in the design of
              digital circuits and systems.
