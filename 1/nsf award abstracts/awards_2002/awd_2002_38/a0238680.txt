Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposed research is the creation of cell-based sensors of
              DNA-damaging agents. Eukaryotic cells have evolved extremely sensitive and
              rapid mechanisms to sense and respond to DNA damage. The first stage of this
              project will quantitatively determine the dose and time-dependence of DNA
              damage-sensitive gene transcription in the budding yeast Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae in response to a panel of selected damaging agents. Clusters of
              genes sensitive and selective for DNA-damaging agents will serve as the basis
              for biosensor design. Next, the damage-regulated genes will be replaced with
              reporter genes to facilitate measurement of gene transcription. The third stage
              of the project will enhance the sensitivity of the cells to DNA damage by
              disabling endogenous DNA damage pathways. Finally, this project will create new
              laboratory materials in molecular and cellular bioengineering for undergraduate
              engineering and high school students. The labs will illustrate the ability to
              quantitatively control how cells respond to environmental stimuli by altering
              the genetic makeup of the cells.
