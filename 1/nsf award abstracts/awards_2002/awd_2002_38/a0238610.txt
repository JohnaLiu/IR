Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop a
              low-cost manufacturing processes for multifunctional composite materials that
              have specific air and ground transportation applications. Existing materials
              designed to protect against explosions or impacts tend to be heavy and to be
              appendages on structural systems. The new materials, which consist of an
              aluminum foam surrounded by facing plies of resin-infused glass, carbon, or
              aramid, will be light weight and designed to integrate affordability and
              functionality. Innovative manufacturing methods, using out-of-autoclave
              processes that are derivatives of liquid molding approaches, will be developed
              to incorporate automation to improve quality and decrease processing time. A
              number of fiber-ply/foam combinations will be fabricated with a focus on
              manufacturing a container for explosives transport and on a hardened aircraft
              door. Prototypes will be fabricated for customer testing. The improved
              processing and unique properties are expected to lead to a variety of other
              applications. 
     These applications of aluminium foam core composites for
              making protective structures will meet the national need for materials that
              provide increased protection and security. The market for protective materials
              is expected to grow, and is already a sizeable $150 - $200 million per year.
