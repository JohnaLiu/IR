Abstract    :
              Efforts to create low cost,high performance communication systems in the future
              will be chal-
lenged by the high cost of developing new interface circuits
              that are suited to their needs.These
interface circuits serve as the
              intermediary between real world signals,which are analog in nature,
and the
              digital processing engines at the core of the system.Current interface circuits
              are primarily
analog in their implementation,which makes their performance
              highly sensitive to manufacturing
variations in the process they are
              fabricated in,and to noise generated by digital circuits that
operate on the
              same chip.The impact of this sensitivity is that interface circuits must be
              custom
designed for the process they are implemented in,cannot be easily
              integrated with their adjoining
digital processor,and are often very
              restricted in their ability to serve a wide variety of applica-
tions.The
              resulting lack of portability of these circuits leads to high development costs
              since they
generally must be redesigned from scratch for new systems.
The
              goal of the proposed research is to develop new interface circuit architectures
              that can be
leveraged over a wide variety of fabrication processes and
              applications,and thereby dramatically
reduce the cost of their implementation
              in future communication applications.This goal will be
achieved by replacing a
              signi .cant portion of the analog circuitry in the interface with
              digital
circuits that realize the required functionality through signal
              processing techniques that will be
developed as part of this e .ort.This
              implementation philosophy will lead to dramatically di .erent
interface
              architectures than in use today,and will provide new insights into the tradeo
              .s between
using analog versus digital circuitry for given function and
              performance requirements.
New simulation models and software tools will be
              developed to facilitate the process of exploring
new system architectures and
              their accompanying circuits.The simulation modeling e .ort will
be focused on
              obtaining accurate behavioral level descriptions of analog components in
              digital
circuit simulators,which will allow straightforward evaluation of the
              impact of di .erent signal
processing algorithms on the overall system
              performance.The software development e .ort will be
directed toward better
              integrating system level and transistor level simulation tools,and
              providing
estimation of the impact of extrinsic factors such as substrate
              noise.
A new educational course will be developed at MIT that passes on the
              knowledge and tools ac-
quired in this research program.The class will teach
              high speed circuit techniques for both analog
and digital components.System
              level concepts will be explored through a combination of mathe-
matical
              analysis and interactive numerical simulation using the custom models and
              software tools.
It will examine the impact of circuit limitations on system
              performance,and explore ways of iter-
ating between circuit and system designs
              to achieve the best overall system performance.Through
MIT 's OpenCourseWare
              initiative,the course materials and software will be made available to
other
              universities as well as industry.Dissemination of the course through the
              OpenCourseWare
program will allow students and industry designers from a
              variety of ethnic,economic,and geo-
graphic backgrounds to have access to
              state of the art techniques and tools for interface circuit
design.
