Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project addresses the
              challenge of seamless interoperability among computer systems and user
              interface components such as displays and keyboards. Such components today are
              tightly coupled with the computer, which restricts the utility of both
              especially in mobile systems, where users invariably have to choose between
              usable displays and reasonable portability.  The system being separates I/O
              devices from computing devices enabling a different mode of use of computers
              where a user can carry around much smaller computing devices and use shared
              larger I/O devices as available..  The design and implementation of these
              enhancements will be guided by feedback from users of prototypes deployed in
              the field.
     In the long run, the widespread adoption of this approach has
              the potential to revolutionize the way humans interact with computers, by
              allowing computing devices to shrink out of sight, while freeing interfaces
              from the constraints of portability.  The technology has immediate commercial
              applications in health care and mobile computing as well, these markets will be
              explored through future strategic partnerships.
