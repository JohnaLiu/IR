Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to expand our knowledge of communication theory,
              information theory, and signal processing, and to make an immediate impact in
              practical wireless communication systems and networks. The research builds upon
              the general theory and code design strategy for space-time coding.  The
              mathematical methods, algorithms, and concepts developed in this research is
              applicable and initiates new activities in many different areas of
              communications and applied mathematics. These areas include modem design,
              equalization, beam-forming, linear algebra, and so
on. Of course, the
              immediate impacts are in increasing the data rates of wireless communication
              systems as well as advancing our understanding of the behavior of
              multiple-input multiple-output
channels.

Currently, there is a fundamental
              theoretical limit which prohibits us from designing full-rate orthogonal
              space-time block codes for more than two transmit antennas.  Also, the
              available codes have not achieved the best performance claimed by information
              theory, so there exists a gap between what is possible, and the state of codes
              today. We seek to eliminate this gap by designing new classes of codes that
              provide full diversity, high rate, small complexity, high performance and
              mathematically interesting structures.
