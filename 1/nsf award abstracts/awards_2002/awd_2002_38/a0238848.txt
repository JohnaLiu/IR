Abstract    :
              0238848   Harrell   Intellectual Merit. The main theme of the proposed work is
              investigation of innovative evolutionary algorithm (EA) techniques for
              constrained problems and reliability-based problems related to surface water
              systems management, and development of guidelines for EA techniques that show
              promise of general applicability to surface water systems analysis. Development
              of new techniques and guidelines for efficient, effective and widely applicable
              methodologies will enhance the state-of-the-art methodologies in evolutionary
              algorithms for applications to complex surface water resources and
              environmental systems management problems.
Broader Impacts. The development of
              guidelines for widely applicable, efficient methodologies for surface water
              systems analysis problems will make broad contributions in the areas of
              evolutionary computing and water resources and environmental systems
              management. An interactive educational module will be developed for graduate
              students for exploring genetic algorithms, including constraint-handling
              techniques, for water resources systems analysis applications. This module will
              be distributed to other educators, creating a broader impact on researchers and
              teachers in the areas of systems analysis, genetic algorithms, and water
              resources management. The elementary educational modules developed will provide
              learning materials and interactive tools to introduce young students to
              exciting applications in water resources and environmental management. The
              published details of these modules will provide a broad impact on elementary
              education.
