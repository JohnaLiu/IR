This proposal combines fluid mechanics and
              seismology to attack two problems: 
(1)	the triggering of distant earthquakes
              and 
(2) the dynamics of volcanic blasts. In the process, undergraduate and
              graduate students will be provided with rigorous, yet accessible, quantitative
              physics-based education. 

The specific tasks proposed are:
1. To teach
              physics-based geology to undergraduates by:
	a. Bringing students into an
              active field research environment
	b. Bringing modern instrumentation into the
              classroom
	c. Designing a new physical volcanology course
	d. Mentoring
              undergraduate research assistants
2. To constrain the mechanisms for
              regional-scale earthquake triggering by
a. Measuring seismically-induced
              permeability and porosity changes with pore pressure data
b.  Determining
              conditions for triggering using earthquake catalogs and waveforms
c. Linking
              fluid flow and triggered seismicity using repeated earthquake data
3. To
              quantify the formation of volcanic directed blasts by:	
	a. Modeling the
              mechanism of compressible jet collapse
	b.  Measuring the basal friction of a
              volcanic landslide
