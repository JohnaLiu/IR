              Physical Information Efficiency for Sensing, Communicating, and Computing

In
              physical computational efficiency, there is no free lunch.    Tradeoffs of
              performance versus resources are everywhere, placing limits on performance and
              efficiency.  To streamline technological processes, we may study and even mimic
              biology's highly efficient integrated systems that get the most bang for their
              resource bucks - the ultimate small smart systems that will revolutionize
              application design microelectronics, bioengineering, nanoscience and other
              fields.  This line of intellectual inquiry opens up vistas to engage the minds
              of scientist and lay people alike.  Consider a miniaturize autonomous cell
              clinic able to navigate your bloodstream and deliver therapy directly to
              damaged cells.  Or environmental micro bots for security, monitoring and
              situation awareness.  All are possible once we pinpoint ways to boost
              communication and computation to use resources in the most efficient ways. 
              This research is laying critical groundwork for comparative analysis and
              application across biological and technological systems.  Lunch may never be
              free-but it can become much cheaper and more nutritious.
