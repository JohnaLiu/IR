Abstract    :
              Layering has long been a basic architectural principal in communication
              
networks. Recently, however, there has been much interest in exploring
              
various techniques that allow for a stronger coupling across traditional
              
layer boundaries, in particular between the physical layer and higher
              
network layers in wireless networks. At the physical layer, the fundamental
              
performance trade-offs as given by information theory are, in many cases,
              
well understood. When higher layer objectives, such as delay, enter the
              
picture, there is much less fundamental understanding.

This research is
              addressing several key problems in cross-layer resource 
allocation in
              wireless networks. In these problems, physical layer "radio 
resources" are
              dynamically allocated over time and between users in order 
to satisfy both
              network layer and physical layer performance requirements. 
Ideas from
              information theory and communication theory are used for 
modeling the
              physical communication channels. Queueing theoretic models are 
used for
              incorporating network-level quality of service issues.  The 
emphasis of this
              effort is to improve understanding of the basic 
architectural trade-offs and
              fundamental performance limitations in these 
settings.
