Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is used to
              convert documents from images to text form. This allows the documents on the
              WWW, in company archives or for government intelligence gathering to be
              searched for
content. The documents that are heavily degraded by printing,
              scanning, photocopying and faxing may be easily readable to humans, but the
              recognition accuracies are very low requiring human
              intervention.
Understanding the image degradations introduced by printing and
              scanning can lead to improvements in OCR. Instead of training the computer to
              recognize characters by providing it with a large variety of examples
              of
characters under different degradation situations we will develop a more
              effective method based on understanding the degradation and being able to
              estimate the degradation characteristics for each document.

To improve the
              performance of OCR, the PI proposes to model the nonlinear systems of printing,
              scanning, photocopying and FAXing. A calibrated model can predict how a
              document will look after being subjected to these processes and can be used to
              develop products that degrade text images less. Once statistically validated,
              researchers will have the confidence to use these models. Estimation of the
              parameters to these models from a short character string allows continuous
              calibration to account for spatially-variant systems. These models and
              parameters will be used to partition the training set based on modeled
              degradations and match the appropriate partition to the test data at hand to
              improve OCR accuracy. This technical side will be combined with an educational
              component to develop an  introduction to engineering course for education
              majors so they may understand, appreciate and educate all K-12 students about
              how math and science are used in engineering.
