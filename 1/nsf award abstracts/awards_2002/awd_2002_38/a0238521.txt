Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop robust and effective techniques to
              model, simulate and interact with soft objects. The physical modeling of
              deformable objects is one of the fundamental and crucial components of many
              graphics and scientific visualization application providing an effective way to
              display and interact with virtual objects that better represent true physical
              nature, beyond unrealistic rigid-body approximation. Soft object modeling has
              been studied extensively using both discrete models and continuum
              mechanics-based models. However, two major issues still pose a significant
              challenge. First, the conflicting demand between computational efficiency and
              biomechanical realism directs us to take trade-offs or to sacrifice one for the
              other. Second, the robust treatment of interaction between soft objects and
              intuitive control is often overlooked, being represented by a single point of
              contact or given external forces. The PI will address issues in the following
              areas: 1) domain decomposition method to represent a complex object structure;
              2) adaptive refinement and simplification of the model while preserving overall
              dynamic behavior; 3) robust constraint-based collision and contact analysis
              between deformable objects; 4) constrained manipulation for intuitive and
              flexible user interface; and 5) fast cluster computing environment and
              associated parallel algorithms. 

The educational component of this project
              includes 1) development of a new physically-based modeling and simulation
              curriculum, 2) development of a realistic tissue deformation model for a
              virtual surgery system which will be used for training medical students and
              surgeons, 3) development of functional anatomy online visualization system for
              K-12 students and the general public, and 4) hosting "How Things Work" workshop
              and animation contest to foster research experiences for undergraduate and
              graduate students in their early academic careers.
