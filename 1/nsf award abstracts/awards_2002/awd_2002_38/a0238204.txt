Abstract    :
              To develop truly integrated human-robot interactive environments to understand,
              assist, rehabilitate, and enhance the human neuromuscular systems, a virtual
              robotic environment that explores human's full potential needs and abilities
              will be developed.  As the first step, an inherently safe stationary wearable
              arm system will be designed and constructed with a neuro-muscular system
              identification technique to extract the human adaptation parameters in real
              time.  The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is that, using this
              virtual robotic environment, fundamental scientific questions relating to human
              perceptual and neural interactions between the virtual and actual movements
              will be investigated.  With these intellectual contributions, this environment
              will immediately lead to rehabilitating patients with motor impairments, even
              for those who are not strong enough to execute task-level movements on their
              own, by steering them beyond what they had previously thought they were capable
              of doing.   The educational goals are to create interdisciplinary educational
              environment, to increase the number of women in engineering and computer
              science, and to increase the interaction between motor-impaired students and
              engineering students.  The proposed research and educational approach will have
              a significant and broader impact not only in the scientific and educational
              communities but also the lives of disabled people who are not currently able to
              independently execute everyday tasks.
