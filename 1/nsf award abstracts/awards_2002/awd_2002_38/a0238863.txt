Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will implement a
              software system that allows domain experts to specify programs that transform
              unstructured or partially structured data from a variety of document sources,
              such as World Wide Web sites, PDF files, and text into structured, coherent,
              and readily usable information.  The system will consist of a set of tightly
              integrated syntactic and semantics-driven data extraction technologies that are
              managed from a graphical user interface.  The goal will be to retrieve
              information that was created for human understandability, and work with it to
              create knowledge that can support automated decision-making and transactions.
              The system will empower users, who are knowledgeable about their application
              domains but are not necessarily trained as computing technologists, to rapidly
              structure data into knowledge.  The Phase II implementation effort will build
              upon the results from the Phase I feasibility study to produce a fully
              functional system.

Phase III will make the system commercially available to
              clients with diverse business interests including content aggregation,
              e-procurement, ERP, and supply chain management vendors.
