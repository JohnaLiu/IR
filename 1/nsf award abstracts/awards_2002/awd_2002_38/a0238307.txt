Abstract    :
              This project addresses fundamental materials science issues relevant to
              potential utilization of organic semiconductors in thin film electronics. In
              addition to structural factors, such as defect density and domain boundaries,
              charge carrier mobility is the primary figure of merit in these ma-terials, and
              is ultimately determined by the electronic band structure and carrier
              localization dy-namics. The central scheme of this proposal is to use
              femtosecond two-photon photoemission spectroscopy (2PPE) to establish
              electronic band structure and electron localization dynamics in organic
              semiconductor crystals, thin films, and at their interfaces with metals, and to
              probe struc-ture-property relationship in these systems.

The project
              addresses fundamental research issues associated with organic electronic
              materials having technological relevance. An important feature of the project
              is the strong emphasis on education, and the integration of research and
              education. This project will support graduate, un-dergraduate, and
              post-doctoral researchers providing training in an exciting and
              interdisciplinary field spanning materials science, chemistry, solid-state
              physics, and laser spectroscopy. Addi-tionally, the academic and industrial
              collaborative nature of the project provides special opportu-nities for
              students.
