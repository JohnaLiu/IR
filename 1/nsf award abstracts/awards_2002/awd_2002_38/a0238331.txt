Abstract    :
              
         Experiments and observations will be used to study the effects of
              global and regional climate change at high altitudes in the Colorado Rocky
              Mountains over the next five years.  This study, initiated in 1973, now
              provides one of the longest and most detailed datasets available for snowfall,
              the timing and abundance of flowering by wildflowers, the emergence of animals
              from hibernation, and the arrival of migratory birds in the spring.  The 1998
              phase change of the North Pacific Oscillation in the Pacific Ocean appears to
              have triggered a change in snowfall, and the consequences for plants and
              animals appear to be significant. This new phase may last for the next two
              decades, and initial results suggest that it is having significant effects on
              the ecology of the Rocky Mountains. The researchers will continue a study where
              heaters are used to simulate global warming, and demographic responses by the
              wildflower populations measured.

         Broader impacts of this research
              are that it will provide a long-term dataset on effects of climate change for
              an ecosystem that should be particularly sensitive to such changes, it will
              train both graduate and undergraduate students, and support continued efforts
              to communicate research results to the public.
