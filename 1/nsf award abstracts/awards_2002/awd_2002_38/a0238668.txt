Abstract    :
              This project addresses some broad issues in climate change uncertainties using a
              2D Integrated Science Assessment Model (ISAM).  In particular, the main
              objectives are to (1) strengthen parametric representation in the current ISAM
              framework, and (2) use the strengthened ISAM framework to evaluate the impact
              of key feedback processes within the climate system involving atmospheric CO2,
              global warming, the hydrological cycle, ocean circulation, the marine carbon
              cycle, and their contribution to spatial and temporal changes in ocean carbon
              uptake.  A focus will be on the investigation of possible changes in the
              Thermohaline Circulation (THC) and its impact on ocean biology, on the
              distribution of temperature and tracers in the ocean, the evolution of the
              atmospheric CO2 concentration, and atmospheric temperature change.

ISAM
              results will be compared with other 2-D and 3-D atmosphere-ocean general
              circulation models 

This research has the potential to increase knowledge
              and understanding of physical processes that influence the concentration levels
              of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This is turn is important for assessing
              the role of human-induced forcing on climate change, an important societal
              issue.
