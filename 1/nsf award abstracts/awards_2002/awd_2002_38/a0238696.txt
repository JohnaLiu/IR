Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II Project proposes to
              develop, test, market and produce  low-power wireless headstage systems for the
              neural prosthetic market.  The wireless neural headstage devices will be able
              to transmit and to receive sixteen electrodes sourced from a patient. The
              analog signals will be encoded and transmitted wirelessly to a remote receiver
              where they will appear on a 16-channel connector. The wireless headstage
              technology will replace the tethered connections and create a more natural and
              productive laboratory environment for patient data acquisition. Ultimately,
              wireless technology will improve the quality of life for anyone using a
              commercial neural prosthetic device by offering extended freedom of motion,
              improved product safety and reliability, and less visual distractions.

The
              primary  commercial application of this project is in the wireless neural
              prosthetic market. Additional applications are expected in the biomonitoring
              business markets, such as for electrophysiological patient testing and
              monitoring.
