Proposal Title: 	CAREER:
              Nanoscale thermal processing with a heated atomic force microscope cantilever
              tip

Since its invention in 1986, the atomic force microscope (AFM) has
              become the most widely used instrument for nanoscience and nanotechnology.  AFM
              cantilevers used in thermomechanical data storage are fabricated with a tip
              having a radius of curvature near 20 nm and integrated heating.  As the heated
              cantilever tip is brought into contact with a substrate, only the area of
              contact between the tip and the substrate is heated.   With a diameter of
              contact as small as 1 nm, the contact area between a heated AFM cantilever tip
              and a substrate is the smallest controlled heating source ever produced.  Thus,
              the heated AFM cantilever tip is an excellent tool for studying the
              fundamentals of heat transport and phase change at the nanometer scale, which
              can be substantially different compared to macroscopic scales.  This research
              plan develops the heated AFM cantilever 
tip as a scientific instrument for
              nanometer-scale characterization of temperature-dependant physical and chemical
              transitions. The educational plan includes the development of a new graduate
              course in the design of thermal and fluid micro and nano devices.  Graduate
              students involved in this research will also be exposed to a broad set of
              technical and cultural experiences, including collaborations with national
              laboratories and industry and with international collaborators.
