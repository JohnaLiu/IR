Abstract    :
              This CAREER project would follow the teacher preparation efforts of five
              community colleges in Mississippi.  The investigator will examine the policy of
              institutions, the classroom and teacher educator, and the learner's development
              from student to teacher.    The intent is to develop better knowledge of how
              teachers develop mathematics ability and understanding by conducting a
              longitudinal study of a cohort of pre-service teachers through various
              programs.   The study is intended to explicate what mathematics educations
              think is important for students, how students are learning mathematics content
              and pedagogy, and what ways to faculty develop across institutions as they
              collaborate in defining goals, course content, and classroom practice.  The
              study will monitor 375 student teachers through their early courses in 4
              community colleges and the University of Southern Mississippi.  

The career
              goals of the young investigator are three:  To make a significant local
              contribution to mathematics education in the State of Mississippi and guide her
              own practice and pursuit of inspiring future teachers to critically analyze the
              way they think about mathematics.  To conduct research studies which contribute
              to national conversation about teacher preparation and the importance of
              mathematics reasoning.  The researcher expects to help define and describe what
              teacher preparation should look like.  Finally, the researcher intends to
              contribute to a state that is poor in wealth and human resources to help
              improve the system of mathematics education.   Her publications address both
              the practice of preparing teachers in classrooms and the policies of
              institutions that provide that guidance.
