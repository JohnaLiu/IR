              ABSTRACT
Proposal Number: CCR-0238289
Title: CAREER: Infrastructure for
              Software Generators and Components
PI: Ioannis Smaragdakis

Domain-specific
              techniques are among the most promising approaches to software construction and
              reuse. The research objective of this proposal is to provide advanced
              infrastructure for software generators
and components--the most common
              domain-specific implementation techniques. 

Specifically, this proposal puts
              forward two concrete ideas, one in the area of (embedded) software generators
              and one in the area of component programming:
-Designing a programming
              language with C++-like  meta-programming support, but without the problems that
              have plagued  C++ template meta-programming.
-Implementing a component
              infrastructure for layered libraries of binary  components. This infrastructure
              uses the technology of dynamic  loading/linking in modern operating
              systems.

Developing such infrastructure is particularly valuable because it
              is the only domain-independent (and thus transferable) part of the intellectual
              effort of building a generator or component library. 
The education and
              outreach objectives of the proposal are to (1) develop a new course on
              component-based and generative software engineering; (2) enhance existing
              courses with the results of the proposed research; (3) author a textbook on
              software component technologies and generative programming; and (4) initiate
              efforts for social outreach and outreach to other scientific areas and software
              professionals.
