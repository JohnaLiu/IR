Abstract    :
              Data management has become a core function of computing, strongly
influencing
              not only performance but also energy consumption, program
security, fault
              tolerance, and other program properties.  While many
programs use a large
              amount of data, they do not access all data at
all times.  Hence, data
              adaptation can improve cache efficiency by
identifying and compacting
              precisely those data required at a given
point of computation.  Such
              fine-grained and dynamic data management
may significantly alleviate the
              bottleneck on communication and
strengthen the control of data.

This
              research studies fine-grained data adaptation through a
compiler-based
              approach.  It develops three compiler-assisted
techniques.  First, program
              monitoring analyzes selected data; then,
locality analysis identifies their
              group locality; and finally, data
transformation changes their layout while
              maintaining program
correctness using run-time data maps.  The new system
              improves cache
optimization for data-intensive applications on conventional
              machines
and memory management for general-purpose programs on
              embedded
devices.  In parallel to research, the investigator
              develops
data-analysis tools to support teaching of memory issues in
              computer
organization, compiler, and programming courses.  The
              investigator
also develops an advanced course that focuses on memory
              optimization
techniques at all system levels.
