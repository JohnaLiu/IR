Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to
              develop a rapid IgSwitch  Assay for inducing and isolating IgG class switch
              variants from IgM hybridomas using in-vitro culture conditions,
              microencapsulation technology and fluorescence activated cell sorting. The
              IgSwitch  Assay is expected to be a significant improvement over conventional
              methods used to isolate class switch variants, and will be useful in cell line
              development and monoclonal antibody production. Prior Phase I research has
              already demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed method using a model IgM
              hybridoma. This Phase II project will develop in-vitro culture conditions that
              promote switching to different IgG subclasses. The Phase II research will also
              validate reagents for a family of isotype specific IgSwitch  Assays. 

The
              commercial application of this project will be in the area of monoclonal
              antibodies. Use of the targeted IgSwitch Assay in monoclonal antibody
              production will help to generate new IgG specific antibodies from a largely
              untapped source of IgM hybridomas, for potential use as research, therapeutic,
              diagnostic, and imaging reagents.
