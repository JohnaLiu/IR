Abstract    :
              The United States is experiencing increasing difficulties with its electricity
              supply infrastructure.  Distributed generation (DG) can play a large role in
              solving these problems and provide other benefits as well.

This proposal
              details a five-year faculty career development plan in DG technology. The
              research plan concentrates on: 1) development of novel power conversion
              systems; and 2) development of a comprehensive computer model of a power system
              with a high connection density of distributed generators.

The educational
              component of the plan includes: 1) enhancement of an existing photovoltaics
              course; 2) development of a wind energy course; 3) curriculum-wide use of the
              systems approach; 4) integration of research-related systems into design
              projects for undergraduate courses; and 5) development of a mini-course on
              renewable energy for South Dakota's Native American citizens.

This proposal
              meets criterion 1, intellectual merit, because: a) the work involves novel
              engineering design, and scientific exploration of an uninvestigated area; b)
              the PI is qualified in this area; c) the work is of importance to several
              fields within Electrical Engineering; d) the work plan and resource needs are
              clearly stated and lead to the desired goals; and e) the needed resources are
              available.

This proposal meets criterion 2, broader impact, because it
              includes: a) development of new educational materials; b) the involvement of an
              underrepresented group, specifically Native Americans; c) specific plans for
              partnerships between investigators, national laboratories, and industry; d) a
              plan to broadly disseminate results; and e) significant benefits to society at
              large.
