Abstract    :
              The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program
              award is to obtain an improved understanding of pre-process dynamics prediction
              for tool/holder/spindle/machine assemblies in high-speed machining
              applications, leading to the development of an Internet-based software
              application. The approach is based on substructure analysis methods where
              models or measurements of individual components are combined analytically to
              predict the final assembly response.  The education objective is to attract
              students to manufacturing careers through applied science-based research
              activities.  An example of these recruiting efforts is Jumbotron video
              presentations describing engineering concepts in the language of football
              during University of Florida home football games. Also, students will be
              involved in industrially relevant manufacturing research, such as high-speed
              machining.

If successful, this effort will lead to improved high-speed
              machining, which will impact many manufacturing operations, such as aerospace
              manufacturing where the high machining volume of both aluminum and titanium
              renders such advances important. The ability to increase material removal rates
              and part quality using the Internet-based software application should reduce
              reworked parts, scrap, and cost and subsequently improve efficiency. 
              Additionally, the education of new manufacturing engineers will improve the
              infrastructure necessary for technological advances in all research sectors.
