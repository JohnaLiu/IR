Abstract    :
              The overall objective of the proposed research is to establish the foundation of
              a legged locomotion laboratory that will provide the infrastructure, equipment
              and support required for graduate and undergraduate students to obtain research
              experience in the areas of design and control of high-performance robots that
              utilize legged locomotion. The proposed research focuses on designing legged
              locomotion systems for increased agility, although a small amount of controller
              development is involved.  Here agility is concerned with aperiodic motions
              which are not fully addressed by the use of gait or other locomotion strategies
              involving predetermined motion primitives. The design methodologies center
              around the development of a performance analysis which describes the dynamic
              dexterity of legged systems in terms of their ability to use contact with the
              environment to accelerate their bodies. In addition to the performance
              analysis, the expected results include agility performance measures and
              actuator selection methodologies, as well as a study of the interplay between
              kinematics and dynamics that results in a high-performance legged locomotion
              system.  These developments are intended to aid in the production of legged
              systems which are highly responsive and adaptable to their environment, thereby
              improving their utility in several diverse application areas of great benefit
              to society.  These areas include search and rescue, for instance searching for
              lost hikers in national parks or locating survivors of catastrophic events, as
              well as planetary exploration and human-service robotics.
