Abstract    :
              The goal of this research and education plan is to broaden the participation of
              historically underserved groups in the information society by identifying
              cultural patterns, social networks and other socio-cultural factors that
              structure information technology access and use. The research approach will
              involve long-term partnerships and continuous interaction with the Belmont
              community in West Philadelphia, and will merge scholarship with ongoing
              programs in the community.  Through reciprocal learning and sharing of
              expertise, researchers, university students, and community leaders will work
              together to identify the particular problems to be addressed, to define
              researchable questions, and to conduct research projects.  Research findings
              and emergent theory will then be translated into culturally based, theory
              driven interventions aimed at increasing the technology capacity and
              sustainability of the community based organizations to better serve their
              clientele. The research results will also make broader scholarly contributions
              through the extension of midrange theory that explains the socio-cultural
              influences, differential impacts, and responses to information technology. In
              addition, the results will make practical contributions through the development
              of interventions such as educational opportunities and curricular resources,
              and recommendations for public policy and future research.
