This project
              is focused on investigating the structure and rheology of soft attractive gels.
              The specific system proposed is water-in-fluorocarbon emulsions in which the
              gel transition is produced by attractive polymer bridging interactions. The PI
              will perform rheology, neutron scattering and dynamic light scattering
              measurements to determine the nature of the interaction forces and the gel
              structure. The concentration and molecular weight of the polymer will be varied
              to control the magnitude and range of the bridging attraction. 

In addition
              to the experiments, the PI proposes theoretical experiments to predict the
              magnitude of the bridging attraction and to improve the available model to
              include interactions between the polymer chains themselves.
