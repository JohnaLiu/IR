Proposal Title: 	CAREER:
              Microscale two-phase zeotropic flow in energy systemss

The PI will
              investigate the coupled heat transfer and fluid flow behavior of two-phase
              zeotropic mixtures in micro- and minichannels. Zeotropic mixtures are distinct
              in that the concentrations of their liquid and vapor phases are continually
              changing in the two-phase region. The temperature glide between the
              concentration profiles can cause both component accumulation at the
              vapor-liquid interface and drastically nonlinear temperature versus enthalpy
              contours. On the microscale, these behaviors can be exacerbated by the
              increased effect of intermolecular interactions. The thermodynamic, heat
              transfer, and fluid flow properties of these mixtures will be studied through
              theoretical modeling, numerical simulation, and experimental observation. The
              results of this project will provide the tools needed to create effective
              miniature vapor compression and absorption cycles, pumping mechanisms, and
              extraction devices. This research can also be used to increase the efficiency
              of heat exchangers that utilize micromachined components, which may have a
              large impact on the costs and emissions generated by energy consumption. These
              types of energy  pplications are appealing to students who are concerned about
              the environment and to students who are interested in current technology. High
              school, undergraduate, and graduate students will be introduced to energy
              systems through a four-tier integrated approach.  The proposal has been funded
              by the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program of the Chemical and
              Transport Systems Division.
