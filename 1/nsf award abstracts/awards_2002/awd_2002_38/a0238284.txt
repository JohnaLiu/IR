Abstract    :
              Advances in robotics and computer-based technology have enabled complex work to
              be performed via remote control, such as in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). 
              The long-term goals of this research are to improve the development and
              integration of robotic technology into surgical practices and the training of
              surgical skills in MIS, which will have a significant impact on patient safety
              and healthcare delivery.  The specific aims are to 1) study the effects of
              robotic technology on the surgical process in MIS, 2) develop methodologies for
              analyzing complex surgical processes in MIS, and metrics for assessing
              technology and surgeon performance in MIS, 3) design effective interfaces and
              informational aids to enhance surgeons' performance, 4) support the training of
              surgeons in MIS with modular computer-based training tools, 5) contribute to
              the theoretical understanding of human performance and error remediation in
              dynamic remote environments, 6) develop and promote the interdisciplinary
              approach to complex systems analysis and design in graduate and undergraduate
              curriculum, using the proposed research activities as course material for
              realistic case-based problem-solving exercises, 7) develop and promote hands-on
              learning through project related research activities in undergraduate
              education, and 8) train successful research scientists and human factors
              engineers through teaching and mentoring activities.
