This proposal details an integrated research and
              educational plan centered on the development of a tissue engineering and
              biomaterials program in the department of Biomedical Engineering at New Jersey
              Institute of Technology. The research component investigates a systematic
              approach in evaluating biomaterials as potential scaffolds for cell based
              therapies and integrating these concepts in new undergraduate and graduate
              courses in biomaterials and biocompatibility and principles of tissue
              engineering, respectively. The goal is to also develop a program that will have
              an impact on increasing the number of underrepresented groups in the field of
              engineering and science by introducing concepts to high school students from
              underrepresented minority groups and training high school teachers of all girl
              schools interactive approaches to teaching engineering to their students.
              

The emerging technology of tissue engineering has the potential of becoming
              the therapy of choice for the regeneration of a number of damaged or diseased
              tissues and organs. The approach is to use cells, instead of drugs, to treat
              various diseases or disorders. At the forefront of investigation is the use of
              stem cells because of their ability to differentiate into various cell types
              and thus, promote the regeneration of the damaged or diseased tissue of
              interest. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotential cells that are
              capable of differentiating along several lineage pathways. MSCs, which are
              obtained from adult bone marrow and expanded in culture, are believed to be
              valuable as a readily available and abundant source of cells in the tissue
              engineering field. However, for treating damaged or diseased connective
              tissues, such as large bone fracture, osteoarthritis, tendon and ligament
              injuries, and spinal cord injury, MSCs must be combined with an appropriate
              scaffold material that promotes attachment and differentiation. For this
              technology to advance into clinical application, the development of improved
              scaffold materials is needed. The goal of this research program is to
              investigate in a systematic fashion the optimal surface properties and
              characteristics of materials that promote stem cell differentiation. 

The
              principal investigator and others have demonstrated that MSCs, when combined
              with bioactive ceramic scaffolds induce bone formation in large, long bone
              defects. However, complete repair and return of mechanical function of the long
              bone is limited due to the brittle nature and/or poor remodeling of the ceramic
              material. Other synthetic and natural biomaterials with improved mechanical and
              degradation properties have been investigated in in vitro experiments as
              potential scaffolds for the MSCs, but once implanted, MSCs fail to induce bone
              repair. Therefore, the objectives of the proposed research are two-fold. First,
              this study is designed to gain a clearer understanding of the mechanism by
              which calcium phosphate ceramics promote MSC differentiation and synthesis of
              new bone tissue by examining the effect of surface properties (e.g. chemistry
              and topography) and ion dissolution/reactions in influencing how stem cells
              adhere, the morphology they assume, and subsequent differentiation. These
              fundamental studies will further advance the development of improved materials
              for stem cell induced bone regeneration. Second, as an extension of this work,
              a novel study examining polymeric materials that have well defined surface
              properties and/or architectures that modulate stem cell morphology will be
              investigated. As a function of cell shape, stem cell differentiation into cell
              phenotypes of bone, cartilage, and adipose tissue will be examined.
