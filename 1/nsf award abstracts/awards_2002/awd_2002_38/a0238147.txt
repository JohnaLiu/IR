Abstract    :
              Systems with distributed computation across open networks share many
              characteristics with economies, with individual computational devices that are
              largely autonomous and represent the self-interest of multiple users, including
              both individuals and businesses. A fundamental challenge is to design useful
              mechanisms to solve distributed problems in these open systems despite the
              self-interest of individual agents. This work proposes a foundational study
              into the issues that arise in computational mechanism design with
              computationally-bounded agents.  One component proposes the study of indirect
              revelation mechanisms, in which agents are able to participate without
              computing, or revealing, complete information about their preferences or local
              constraints. Another component proposes the study of mechanisms that provide
              approximations to game-theoretic desiderata, such as strategy proofness. In
              both cases, the research agenda calls both for new theories and for new
              computational methods, that leverage the theory constructively within systems. 
              The broader impact of the work promises the continued integration of
              game-theoretic and economic methods into computational systems, with
              applications ranging from automated mediation in e-marketplaces, to automated
              negotiation between devices in open systems. An important component involves
              the development of innovative graduate and undergraduate curricula, to help to
              educate students about problems at the interface between computer science and
              economics.
