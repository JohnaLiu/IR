Abstract    :
              Computing devices and applications are rapidly infiltrating every aspect of our
              everyday lives.  The move of computing from the office desktop to ubiquitous
              presence in homes, in communities, and at play poses a challenge to
              human-computer interaction, because many of the attributes that are most
              important for workplace computing such as efficiency, problem-solving
              functionality, and standardization, are less central for other parts of our
              lives.  Designing everyday computing applications that are appropriate for
              everyday life requires rethinking and adapting our methodologies; otherwise, we
              risk making all of our life like work.  In this project, the PI will exploit
              cultural theory to analyze the cultural context of everyday life and develop
              appropriate computer science technologies and methodologies that support
              open-ended activity, user reflection, variations in style of living, personal
              meaning, and everyday values.  These themes will be studied within the context
              of three applications: a system that monitors a home's emotional climate and
              provides users with open-ended feedback about it; information appliances for
              the home that support awareness of consumption; and an affective wearable
              device that explores emotional issues in backpacking.  The project integrates
              activities across the disciplines that make up Cornell's new Information
              Science program, and supports the consolidation of the currently fragmented
              interdisciplinary community of researchers working in this area.  It will also
              educate students from a variety of backgrounds and interests to integrate
              technical and cultural perspectives through interdisciplinary courses and
              involvement in the PI's research.
