Two models are currently used to understand
              the rheology of gels: fractal- and percolation-based.  The conclusions of each
              approach rely on the mechanics of particle chains that form gel backbones. The
              PI proposes to directly measure the microrheology of the gel backbone using
              optical micromanipulation, such as Optical 'tweezers', and probe microrheology
              based on the motion of embedded particles induced by magnetic or optical
              forces

The education program is mostly based on broad distribution of the
              course material and promoting interdisciplinary education.
