Abstract    :
              Extinction is controlled by habitat destruction, disease, harvest, birth rate
              and the genetic health of a population, among other factors. This study uses
              high-performance supercomputing to realistically simulate the forces on natural
              populations to understand which types of wildlife are most likely to face
              extinction. To ensure that the project produces new knowledge of practical
              importance on the causes of extinction, and new computational tools that will
              be useful to managers of natural populations, the project will work closely
              with Native American and Federal salmon biologists in the Pacific Northwest and
              population biologists in Europe.

There is wide recognition that life on
              Earth is undergoing a sixth major extinction event caused by human generated
              forces. Preventing extinction has been a high priority of people for many
              years. This project will help conserve natural systems by discovering new
              scientific knowledge on the causes of extinction. Most previous theoretical
              work on extinction focused on only one or two extinction forces at a time, for
              reasons of mathematical tractability. However, the multiplicity of forces
              controlling the fate of natural populations are inexorably
              intertwined,
operating simultaneously and synergistically. This innovative
              project seeks to understand how extinction is governed by the interplay of
              these forces by using mechanistic computer models that capture essential levels
              of environmental and biological complexity.
