This CAREER project is
              focused on the studies that are aimed at developing the 3 dimensional, fully
              coupled, constitutive laws and fracture mechanics theories for performance and
              reliability modeling of ferroelectric ceramics devices. Information obtained
              from microelectromechanical self consistent models will be incorporated into a
              phenomenological constitutive framework, and the constitutive laws will be
              applied to analyze the fracture processes in ferroelectric ceramics.

The
              broad impacts include both domestic and international collaborations,wide
              dissemination of computer codes over the web, graduate and undergraduate
              students involvement and mentoring, and the transfer of the modeling and
              analytical tools to device designers and researchers. Out reach to
              undergraduate groups and women and minorities will be emphasized.

This is a
              new CAREER award of the CMS/ENG Division.
