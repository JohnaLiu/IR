Abstract

Engineers and
              artists approach problems in a very different manner. The terms engineer and
              artist are used in a very broad way; engineers are people who primarily build
              things and tend to approach problems by asking how something can be done.
              Artists, on the other hand, create content and focus on what information they
              are trying to convey. Both of these approaches are important, and it is often
              the intersection of the two that produces the most compelling results. Computer
              graphics has been fortunate in that a large artistic community is actively
              involved its development. Unfortunately, software design is still largely in
              the hands of the engineers.

The goal of this proposal is to bring the
              artistic approach into existing software and to bridge the communication gap
              between artists and engineers. As a maturing field, computer graphics is ready
              to address the problem of purposeful display - not just how to render an image
              from a model, but how should it be rendered so as to convey specific
              information about that model.
