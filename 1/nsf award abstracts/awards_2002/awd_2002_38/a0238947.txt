Abstract    :
              This  Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project  will  develop 
              new  techniques  to  treat  both  internal  and  external surfaces of polymer
              tubing such as catheters. The treatments will modify the surfaces to facilitate
              attachment  of  bioactive  coatings,  clean,  sterilize,  or  reduce  friction;
               similar  processes  can  also deposit organic or inorganic coatings. Plasmas
              driven by electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) will treat the lumen and external
              surfaces more uniformly, and over a greater range of 
parameters, than
              conventional plasmas and can be spatially localized to provide different
              effects 
on each. 

The ECR plasma process should be expandable to
              large-scale, low-cost commercial production 
coating  and surface modification
              of catheters. Surface treatments to facilitate attachment of 
bioactive
              coatings to hemodialysis and other catheter types would have  societal benefits
              by 
extending the period between catheter replacements clear therapeutic and
              economic.
