Abstract    :
              This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to develop
              next-generation functional materials by systemically engineering macroscopic
              structures comprised of functional nanotubes.  Nanocrystals and nanostructures
              are often cited as candidate materials that can be engineered to exhibit
              enhanced or entirely new properties for use in different applications. 
              Specifically in this project, the individual boron nitride (BN) nanotubes that
              exhibit actuation mechanisms similar to that found in nature (i.e., slip-stick
              fibrillar motion) will be assembled to create new functional macrostructures. 
              This novel concept originates from the newly observed piezoelectric (PZT)
              effect in BN nanotubes, which can be utilized to fabricate ceramic
              piezoelectric fibers with controllable expansion and contraction and astounding
              electrical and mechanical properties.  Such actuation of nanotube networks is
              poorly understood at present, yet offers immense payoffs in the future if this
              property can be harnessed to make lightweight, strong, multifunctional
              composites.  To achieve such development, this project will target: i) design
              and development of functional nanotube-based composite fibers made of BN
              nanotubes, ii) design and development of macroscopic actuators and sensors
              comprised of functional nanotube composites, and ultimately iii) development of
              analytical models and control experiment in order to be able to manipulate the
              nanoscopic properties and fabrication parameters to arrive at the desired
              macroscopic performance.  The hypothesis here is that such systems theory-based
              approach will facilitate the automation of an iterative design process for the
              final macrostructure actuator/sensor subsystems and provide modularity and
              interchangeability between different nanoscopic to macroscopic
              configurations.

This research project offers a promising new type of
              actuator/sensor configuration that is based on dimensional changes and requires
              no dopant intercalation, which tremendously increases the actuator stroke and
              stress generation capabilities way above current technology.  This
              actuator/sensor configuration has the potential for: i) establishing some of
              the early foundations for future nano-scale robotics via the utilization of
              nanotube-based devices, ii) creating next generation nano-scale pumps and
              nano-engines via a better understanding of the nanotube actuation mechanism,
              and (iii) utilization in many scientific disciplines such as vibration control,
              biomedical applications (drug delivery and tumor removal), and power generation
              applications.  The educational plan of this CAREER project is centered on
              fostering the interdisciplinary aspects of the proposed research program
              through involving high-school students, K-12 math, computer science and physics
              teachers, undergraduate and graduate students.  Specifically, this plan will
              include new cross-disciplinary graduate course development and implementation
              on nanotube-based actuators and sensors, retention and mentoring plan for
              underrepresented minorities and under-privileged students through two
              award-winning programs at Clemson University (PEER Program - Programs for
              Educational Enrichment and Retention and the WISE Program - Women In Science
              and Engineering), outreach program for secondary education through employing
              inquiry-based cooperative learning program for high-school students and K-12
              teachers utilizing two NSF-funded initiatives (Clemson GK-12 project and the
              SMTG project of the AOP Hub of the South Carolina State Systematic Initiative),
              and finally development of an academe-industry-government partnership through
              Michelin Corporation and Solid State Division of the Oak Ridge National
              Laboratory.
