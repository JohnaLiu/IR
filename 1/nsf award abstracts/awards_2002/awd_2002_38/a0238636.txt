The proposal is focused on
              three different concepts for developing and manufacturing colloidal templates,
              namely using electrophoresis and dielectrophoresis as well as supercritical
              Carbon Dioxide.  The combination of electrophoresis and dielectrophoresis are
              flexible tools for developing colloidal templates that should be scalable to
              manufacturing uses. The use of supercritical carbon dioxide as a medium for
              performing the templating provides control over the process.

The educational
              plan consists of integration of microfluidic devices into the undergraduate
              laboratory and the development of  specific course modules in areas such as
              Colloidal Science that could be then incorporated into other courses. The PI
              also plans to establish collaboration with NC A&T, an HBCU.
