Abstract    :
              Cooperating underwater robots must coordinate their actions despite severe
              communication bandwidth limits that exist underwater.  This proposed research
              addresses the coordination of underwater robots through the development of
              theoretically justified decentralized control laws that enable a platoon of
              autonomous underwater vehicles to cooperatively achieve a common goal while
              requiring minimal communication.  Fully realistic field trials are a crucial
              adjunct to our analytic activities.  In a collaborative effort with biologists
              and marine scientists, platoons of small, inexpensive, autonomous underwater
              vehicles will be deployed in a large coastal estuary to rapidly and adaptively
              map bio-active chemicals.  Education and outreach will be integrated with the
              proposed research through both the development of a new course on the dynamics
              and control of underwater robots, and the creation of a new autonomous
              underwater vehicle contest for middle school and high school students in
              collaboration with colleagues at MIT and the Association of Unmanned Vehicle
              Systems International.  The intellectual merits of the proposed research
              include the development of an improved toolbox of distributed control laws and
              an improved understanding of communication requirements for platoons of
              autonomous vehicles in unstructured, real-world environments.  The broader
              impacts of this research effort include: the development of affordable
              technology that will enable ocean and marine scientists to conduct scientific
              investigations that are not otherwise possible; the development of curriculum,
              course materials, and laboratory projects for underwater robotics; and the
              creation of an autonomous underwater vehicle contest that is accessible to
              middle school and high school students.
