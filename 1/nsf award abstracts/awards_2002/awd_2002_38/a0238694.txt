Abstract    :
              This project will integrate studies of magnetic reconnection with educational
              procedures for both undergraduate students and graduate students on the subject
              of reconnection.  Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process the converts
              magnetic energy to into heat and high speed flows in many natural and
              artificial plasmas.  It plays an essential role in the physics of the Earth's
              magnetosphere, the interaction of the magnetosphere with the solar wind, the
              solar corona, the interstellar medium, molecular clouds and accretion disks. 
              In addition it also plays an important role in laboratory fusion experiments. 
              This project is a five year plan that will examine questions about the role of
              plasma instabilities on 3-D reconnection; the role of strong gradients, weak
              magnetic shear and finite collision frequency on the reconnection rate; the
              role of reconnection on small scale turbulence; the experimental signatures of
              reconnection; and comparison of model/simulation results to observations of
              reconnection in systems such as the Earth's magnetopause.  All these scientific
              investigations will be integrated in undergraduate and graduate physics
              courses.  This project will aid in the establishment of the Dartmouth
              Computational Plasma Physics Facility.
