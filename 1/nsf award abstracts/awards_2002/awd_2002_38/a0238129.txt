Abstract    :
              The investigator proposes to conduct design-based research to examine teachers'
              understanding and use of inquiry-based methods in science, children's emergent
              conceptual understanding of science content, and strategies embedded in
              inquiry-based activities to support metacognitive reading comprehension of
              fourth-grade students. 

In this research, a series of qualitative and
              quantitative studies will be undertaken that examine the intersection of
              metacognitive comprehension strategies and inquiry-based methods in developing
              a technology-based system designed for fourth grade elementary school science. 
              Comprehension skills are crucial to support elementary school students'
              learning of science content particularly when employing inquiry-based methods
              and expository text.  The results are expected to improve understanding of
              reading comprehension strategy supports in science activities.

This research
              will be closely integrated with several educational activities in collaborative
              instructional design and elementary school science teaching. Two graduate
              assistantships will be supported across the five years of the grant in addition
              to tuition or stipend support for the participation of six teacher-designers
              who will co-construct an inquiry-based strategy support system with
              researchers. Research output from this effort will encompass multiple
              publications, Web-based curriculum artifacts and videotaped examples of the
              instructional approach disseminated on the Web for teacher review and
              comment.
