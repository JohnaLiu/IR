Abstract    :
              The goal of the workshop is to bring together a multidisciplinary group of
              researchers to identify and explore promising research directions in the
              alternatives to CMOS, that is, nano-based technologies. The researchers come
              from diverse communities including computer science, design automation,
              computer architecture, device physicists, and physical designers. The workshop
              aims at pinpointing the areas in which computer scientists and engineers can
              make important contributions to the technology of nanoelectronic computers.
              Researchers are to present position papers followed by discussions and breakout
              groups in which everyone participates. Sample questions being addressed
              are:
How will design sciences change in order to design, build and program
              future computers based on nanoelectronic principles?
What are the enabling
              abstractions that permit productive research on the design of nano
              computers?
What technologies from computer science and engineering are needed
              by the nanotechnology community?
What investments are needed and when to
              foster proper development of computing technologies for nano computing?
In
              order to provide a broad input to the workshop, there will be a workshop
              website. Prior to the meeting, comments from interested parties about the
              workshop topics can be posted on the website. A draft workshop report will be
              prepared at the meeting, posted on the workshop website and commentary from
              researchers solicited.
