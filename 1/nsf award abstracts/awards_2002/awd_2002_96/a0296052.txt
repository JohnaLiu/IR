Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to finish building the astrophysical gamma ray detector, STACEE
              (Solar Tower Atmospheric Cherenkov Effect Experiment) this year and to operate
              it for a duration of three years.  STACEE will be used to study astronomical
              sources that emit photons at GeV energies.  The sources are AGN, gamma bursts,
              pulsars, and supernova remnants.
