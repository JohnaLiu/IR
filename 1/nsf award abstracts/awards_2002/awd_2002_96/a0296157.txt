Abstract    :
              This collaborative award examines the regional precipitation-evaporation balance
              and its effect on ecosystems in the climatically sensitive Yukon Territory.
              Arctic ecosystems are bellwethers for global climate change and examining their
              responses to natural climate variability is critical to understanding
              fundamental earth system processes as well as the potential response of such
              systems to human-induced changes in climate.

By using a combination of
              biotic (i.e., pollen, charcoal) and abiotic (i.e., elemental and isotopic
              analyses, magnetic susceptibility, sedimentary analyses) proxies, the
              investigators will produce high-resolution climate records from the past 1,500
              years that examine regional variability in moisture. These results will then be
              compared with findings from ongoing research across the interior of Alaska. 
              

Some of the questions that will be answered by this research are; "Have
              past changes in precipitation-evaporation balance occurred in the upper Yukon
              and have they occurred on time scales relevant to humans? Did these changes
              occur synchronously and in the same direction across the Yukon?  Were they
              synchronous with changes in other regions? Did vegetation respond to climate
              change?"
