It is proposed to study certain inverse scattering problems
              arising in 
quantum mechanics and wave propagation.  Such problems are
              governed 
by the Schroedinger equation, its variants, the wave equation and
              the 
telegraphy equation in the frequency domain.  Using techniques related to
              
Riemann-Hilbert problems, operator factorizations, and spectral analysis 
of
              differential operators, the aim is to recover coefficients appearing in the
              
relevant differential equations in terms of a suitable set of scattering
              data. 
In addition to their practical importance in physics, engineering, and
              other 
applied fields, these inverse problems contribute mathematical
              techniques 
to various areas of mathematics such as nonlinear differential
              equations, 
integral equations, boundary value problems, and applied
              functional 
analysis.

The inverse scattering problems under study are
              motivated by their 
important applications in many areas such as materials
              science, 
nondestructive testing, acoustic imaging, seismology, geophysics,
              and 
remote sensing.  In materials science the solution of the inverse
              scattering 
problem amounts to determining surface and subsurface structure of
              
materials by analyzing neutron beams scattered off the materials, for
              
example, helping to understand bonding of polymer components.  In 
quantum
              mechanics it corresponds to the determination of forces holding 
molecules,
              atoms, and subatomic particles together by analyzing colliding 
beams of
              particles.  In remote sensing it helps to profile unknown targets 
by
              analyzing acoustic or electromagnetic waves scattered off such targets.
