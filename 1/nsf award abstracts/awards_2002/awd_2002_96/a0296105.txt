Abstract    :
              9712831  Lambros  Modeling of interphase regions found both in nature (animal 
              and plant tissue and bone) and artificially manufactured  materials (composite
              fiber/matrix region) has been performed  using the concept of  Continuously
              Nonhomogeneous Medium  (CNM). The present project provides measurements for the
               experimental validation of the CNM concept. Using full-field  optical
              techniques, stationary crack behavior in specific  interphase regions
              containing CNMs is investigated. The  observed stress distributions and
              measured stress intensity  factors are compared with existing theoretical
              models. An  analytical investigation to determine the sensitivity of  existing
              models to key nonhomogeneity parameters is also  conducted.  Experimental and
              theoretical investigation of  quasi-static crack propagation in CNMs is also
              performed.  ***
