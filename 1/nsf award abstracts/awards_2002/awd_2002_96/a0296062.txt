Abstract    :
              The emergent literature on expertise demonstrates the powerful role of
              deliberate practice in the development of high-level expertise.  Yet the
              question remains as to whether effects of such practice and dedicated effort
              are constrained by individual differences in cognitive aptitude, particularly
              when highly demanding intellectual domains are involved, and how cognitive and
              motivational factors interact with each other in skill development.  The
              objectives of this study are to (1) describe the intra-individual trajectories
              of skill development in the game of Go for a two-year period and
              inter-individual differences (variance) in these developmental trajectories
              among a group of elementary school children (ages 6-11); (2) determine the
              predictive efficacy of psychometric measures of cognitive aptitude (fluid
              ability), as well as initial success levels, intrinsic interest, and deliberate
              practice, with respect to the rate of skill development; and (3) identify
              developmental constraints of cognition and motivation on the development of
              expertise in complex skill/knowledge domains.  
To achieve the above
              objectives, a longitudinal design with multiple age cohorts will be employed,
              and structural equation modeling will be used to model the latent growth (rate
              of skill development), reciprocal relationships among cognitive aptitude,
              initial success levels, intrinsic interest, and deliberate practice, and their
              effects on individual differences in the rate of the acquisition of expertise.
