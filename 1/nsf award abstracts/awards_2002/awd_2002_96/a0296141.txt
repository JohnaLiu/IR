Patches are an important feature of models of predators
              and their prey.  Empirical evidence demonstrating the importance of such
              patches is lacking, however.  Information is unavailable on how emigration,
              immigration and colonization are influenced by patches within a habitat. 
              Information on the behavioral nature of pre- and post-dispersal foraging or
              oviposition behavior of predators and their prey is particularly lacking.  This
              project will link spatial considerations of population dynamics and animal
              foraging behavior.  It will investigate a set of interacting insect species
              within the tall-grass prairie, which is well suited for these investigations. 
              It will examine how patch character for a planthopper will effect it and an
              important parasitoid.  It will combine a series of field observations and
              experiments with the development of a behaviorally based, spatially explicitly
              host-parasitoid model which will be tested against census data from natural
              populations.  This project has important pest-management and basic-ecological
              implications.
