Abstract    :
              9802248  Crippens    ABSTRACT: The Parents Involved/Pigeons Everywhere (PIPE)
              project is a collaboration between KCTE-Community Television of Southern
              California, The American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the
              Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology.  They are developing a three-year model
              project to engage parents in science education with their children through
              Project PigeonWatch, a citizen-science program run by Cornell University.  The
              PIPE project will develop videos and written materials for use in a series of
              parent workshops designed for libraries and community science centers.  The
              materials and workshops will be targeted to low-income parents with children in
              grades three through five and will be tested at 27 pilot sites around the
              country.  A PIPE leader's Web Site will link all of the pilot sites.  At the
              end of the pilot stage, the video and print materials will be widely available
              and the applicants will produce a publication that indicates strategies for
              using and building on PIPE and will provide assistance to new sites that wish
              to implement the program.
