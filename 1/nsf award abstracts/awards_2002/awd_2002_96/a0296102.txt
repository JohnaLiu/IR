Abstract    :
              
Photonic devices are critical to the development of next generation
              information and telecommunications technologies.  Mechanical strain induced in
              processing and service of the devices has wide ranging effects on functional
              properties from the atomic scale up to the continuum scale.  This CAREER
              program will develop coupled mechanics, physics, and materials models to
              address these multiscale phenomena.  Computational and analytical methods will
              be used to study the following problems: (i) defect and interfacial strain
              effects on electronic structure in optoelectronic materials, (ii) mismatch
              strain effects in arrays of self-assembled quantum dots, and (iii) process
              strain-induced curvature in thin, free standing optical MEMS devices.  The
              research program will be complemented by a comprehensive educational plan, with
              the goal of motivating students to study micro- and nanomechanics.  A freshman
              level mini-course in nanomechanics will be instituted as part of the Intro to
              Engineering series in the College of Engineering.  A journal club for students
              of all levels interested in micro- and nanomechanics will be organized.  A
              student chapter of the Materials Research Society will be founded and will
              allow students to take advantage of the proximity of the University to the fall
              annual meeting held each year in Boston.
