Abstract    :
              ***  9801554  Blazie  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project
              from Blazie Engineering, Inc. will conduct research leading to the development
              of three working prototypes of a new print reading machine for the blind.  As
              of early 1996, the only existing device in the world that can produce a tactile
              image of print from a small hand held camera, the Optacon, is no longer being
              produced by its manufacturer.  In Phase I, the researchers demonstrated the
              feasibility of incorporating new technology in a new print reading machine
              which make it easier to use, quicker to learn, less expensive, and attractive
              to a larger market.  A new tactile screen was designed which should
              significantly reduce costs and provide a clearer tactile image.  A new camera
              design coupled with built in synthetic speech would make the device easier to
              learn and use and, with the proper accessories, the device would appeal to a
              larger market.  The Phase II effort includes the following: detailed design,
              construction and user testing of the new tactile array; research and design of
              a new camera to produce a better tactile image; built-in speech synthesis and
              capability for training programs; development of software to allow tactile
              imaging of a PC screen; and design of hardware that allows for future expansion
              (including multi-purpose interface for additional cameras/scanners, hardware
              features to allow built in training features, and communications ports and
              universal serial bus for future expansion to market).  The Optacon print reader
              enables blind individuals to have access to the study of mathematics and
              science.  If this research is successful an improved, lower-cost commercial
              product incorporating new technology will result which make such access not
              only possible but also more attractive to a wider population.  This new print
              reader for the blind will increase their employment opportunities and
              self-sufficiency to perform household management tasks as well as their ability
              to interface with print material s.  ***
