Abstract: The main
              objective of the proposed research is to understand more deeply the conformal,
              harmonic, and metric geometry of planar domains. More specifically, the
              research will focus on establishing sharp metrical bounds on the rotation of
              Green lines and elucidating their relationship with the properties of harmonic
              measure and conformal mappings. The research should provide a clearer
              understanding of the connection between the bounds for simply connected and
              nonsimply connected domains. Binder will also explore possible applications of
              these ideas  to complex dynamics.

Conformal mappings and harmonic measure
              are classical objects, extensively used for more than a hundred years in
              different areas of mathematics, as well as in engineering and physics. By
              contrast, the theory of systems with chaotic (or "fractal") behavior is one of
              the newest and most active areas of mathematics, with a multitude of
              applications to biology, physics, computer science and engineering. Binder's
              project seeks to employ the techniques and ideas of the modern theory of
              chaotic systems in order to investigate time-honored questions concerning
              conformal mappings and harmonic measure, in the hope of shedding new light on
              these venerable subjects and opening doors to potentially exciting applications
              in both mathematics and the applied sciences.
