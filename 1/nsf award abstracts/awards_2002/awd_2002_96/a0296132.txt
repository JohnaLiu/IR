Abstract    :
              Professor Terry Gullion of West Virginia University is supported by the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry program to further develop solid state NMR
              methods applied to amorphous solids.  The systems to be studied include
              molecularly doped polymers relevant to xerography.  The PI is coinventor of
              REAPDOR and REDOR methods and in this proposal he will further enhance the
              utility of these methods.  For REAPDOR, he proposes to derive a universal
              calibration curve so that costly quantum calculations are not necessary for the
              interpretation of the signals.  

Development of NMR methods affords
              opportunities to study amorphous solids, which are otherwise difficult to
              study.  Once the field matures, the methods have the potential to be applied
              broadly to problems in solid state physics, chemistry and materials science. 
              The application here, the structure of molecularly doped polymers, is relevant
              to xerography.
