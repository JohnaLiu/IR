Abstract    :
              This program will develop a quantitative relation between the observed solar
              wind and variations in the magnetic field in the Earth's magnetosphere.  The
              new magnetic field model will be based on the previous work done by the PI in
              developing magnetospheric field models.  New data sets from the POLAR, GEOTAIL,
              CRRES, and GOES satellites will be correlated with Solar Wind parameters
              measured by the WIND and ACE satellites.  This program will make significant
              improvements to the most widely used magnetic field model in the Space physics
              and Space Weather community.  By indexing the resulting model to solar wind
              conditions it will provide a greatly improved forecast ability.
