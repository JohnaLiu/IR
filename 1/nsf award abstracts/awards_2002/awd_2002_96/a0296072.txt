Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to develop a new stochastic modeling approach
              that can be used to characterize three-dimensional groundwater flow and
              contaminate transport at heterogeneous sites under realistic field conditions. 
              The research is particularly concerned with the design of a characterization
              tool that can adapt to nonstationary hydrological and geological conditions. 
              So far, stochastic methods have not been developed to the point at which they
              can be routinely used for solving groundwater contamination problems because
              current methods either require excessive computational power or they are too
              restrictive in the assumptions that must be made.  This research will extend,
              reformulate and generalize the nonstationary spectral method recently developed
              by the PI and present a novel way for its numerical implementation.  The
              effectiveness of the new modeling approach will be illustrated with an
              application  to an appropriate field site and systematic comparison with
              existing deterministic and stochastic models and large-scale numerical
              simulations.
