Abstract    :
              MICRO-MACRO MODELING OF THE EXTERNAL STRENGTHENING OF CONCRETE WITH FIBER
              REINFORCED POLYMER

ABSTRACT

     	The objective of the project is to
              develop innovative short-term tests that would allow the development of
              analytical models for accurate prediction of long-term performance of
              retrofitted highway bridge structures. Specifically, the interfacial bond
              between the concrete substrate and the FRP composite material used for external
              strengthening must remain durable for the specified lifetime over a range of
              mechanical loads, temperature cycles, moisture diffusion and de-icing salt
              ingress. The technical approach for developing a bond durability prediction
              methodology consists of understanding the fundamental mechanisms of degradation
              at the bond interphase using nano-scale fractograhic inspection and
              incorporating these in analytical models using global-local substructuring to
              bridge length-scales.
