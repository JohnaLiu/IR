In scientific disciplines, significant issues are sometimes
              assumed
away by overmodeling, which results in lost knowledge. 
              Such
overmodeling is often caused by analytical or computational
              difficulty
of the issues involved.  By shifting the existing balance
              among
modeling, analytical, and computational components of the
              current
solution to an issue, one inevitably discovers new
              technologies.
Motivated by this research philosophy, this project has three
              general
themes.  The first is to explore trade-offs between modeling
              and
computation in finance with emphasis on advancing
              computational
technologies for practical and theoretical finance problems. 
              The
second is to develop finance ideas to help solve computer
              science
problems.  The third is to formulate novel finance problems
              which
break away from traditional paradigms of finance research.

This
              project pursues these three themes in five interrelated areas of
computational
              finance: (1) market modeling, (2) investment and trading
algorithms, (3) risk
              management, (4) market index design, and (5)
auctions.

For the area of
              market modeling, the main goal is to study short-term
predictability of stock
              markets using agent-based approaches. The
models established will be used to
              test algorithms developed for other
parts of the project.

For the area of
              investment and trading algorithms, this project
focuses on two fundamental
              issues: (1) what sorts of information can
be used to enhance the performance
              of a portfolio and (2) how to
measure the performance of investment and
              trading algorithms.  Results
in this area can be useful for long-term
              investors such as those who
save for retirement.

For the area of risk
              management, this project investigates two basic
issues: (1) how to assess the
              risk of a portfolio of assets and (2)
how to design optimal portfolios which
              meet security requirements.
Results in this area may be used to help
              institutional investors
detect and minimize unwanted risks.

For the area of
              market index design, novel optimization problems will
be formulated to help
              design portfolios which are easier to manage
than popular market indices but
              can track or outperform the indices.

For the area of auctions, the primary
              goal is to use auction
algorithms to design solutions to computer science
              problems.  To this
end, the project will identify auction primitives which can
              be used to
construct complicated auction mechanisms.
