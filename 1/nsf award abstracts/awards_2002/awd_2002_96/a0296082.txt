Abstract    :
              Product line engineering (PLE) is a specialized form of software reuse that has
              recently attracted  the interest of software researchers and practitioners. 
              Software architecture is generally  perceived as an effective artifact to
              control the evolution of product lines; it embodies earliest decisions for the
              product line and provides a framework within which reusable components can be
              developed. The focus in this project is on defining and investigating metrics
              for domain  architectures.  The project adopts a three-tiered
              approach,
involving a distinction between qualitative features, quantitative
              factors, and computable metrics.  The link between qualitative features and
              quantitative factors is investigated by analytical means (to derive
              deterministic or probabilistic relationships between them), and the link
              between quantitative factors and computable metrics is investigated by
              empirical means (to validate the proposed metrics).  A compiler will be
              developed to derive metrics tables for product line architectures from formal
              architectural descriptions.  This project will enhance our understanding of
              quality attributes of product line architectures, and will enable us to better
              quantify these attributes.
