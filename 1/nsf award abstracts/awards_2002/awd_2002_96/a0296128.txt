Abstract    :
              This project brings together several important research areas,
              including
parallel compilers, Single-Program Multiple-Data (SPMD) libraries,
              and
object-oriented programming models.  The project combines these ideas
              to
achieve high performance on parallel machines in a robust fashion over
              a
range of languages.

Building on earlier research in the Parallel Compiler
              Runtime Consortium
(PCRC) project, this project will investigate a language
              model that
combines data-parallel features from High Performance Fortran (HPF)
              with an
explicitly parallel SPMD programming style.  This "HPspmd" model
              allows
direct calls to many established libraries for parallel programming
              with
distributed data. By relaxing HPF's single-threaded semantics and
              having
the programmer explicitly manage non-local references, the task of
              the
compiler is hugely simplified. However, good library bindings (e.g.
              class
libraries) supply the required expressiveness for programming. 
              This
project will develop and optimize a Java version of the language
              model
(HPJava); design and implement bindings to parallel libraries such
              as
CHAOS, DAGH, Global Arrays, MPI,and ScaLAPACK; and implement
              large
applications within the resulting framework.  The implementations
              are
expected to drive further refinement of the language model, especially
              in
support of irregular problems.
