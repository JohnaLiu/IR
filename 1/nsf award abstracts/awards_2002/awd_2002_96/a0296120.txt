Abstract    :
              This project from Prof. Luis Echegoyen at the University of Miami is focused on
              the electrochemical properties of substituted fullerenes, with the promise that
              electrodeposited thin layers of such materials will exhibit unique and
              exploitable properties.  The first area of research focuses on compounds that
              tether a crown ether moiety to the fullerene base.  As cations move into the
              crown ether, the electrochemical properties of the entire complex are changed. 
              A second part of the proposed research is the induced isomerization of malonate
              complexes of the fullerenes, with the promise that this isomerization reaction
              can be controlled to provide a synthetic route to otherwise inaccessible
              compounds.  Finally, controlled potential electrolysis of functionalized
              fullerenes is used to produce free fullerenes that are trapped within a
              molecular box framework.   Prof. Echegoyen's research group has an excellent
              record for the education of professional chemists from underrepresented groups,
              based on past record, and that tradition is expected to continue.

This
              project takes advantage of some recently discovered chemistry of "buckyballs",
              namely the ability to derivatize them and control their electrochemical
              reactivity, and the ability to trap species inside of the buckball cavity to
              accomplish the same goal.  The diversity of chemical groups that link to the
              buckyball substrate is broad, and so the range of reactive tunability is
              correspondingly large, allowing surfaces with specific properties to be
              devised.  Such a skill is useful in creating better electrode materials and
              better sensors for chemical analysis.
