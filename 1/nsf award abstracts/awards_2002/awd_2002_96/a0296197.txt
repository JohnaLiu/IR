POWRE:
              Parallel and Distributed Protein Sequence-Structure Alignment


 This POWRE
              proposal proposes to study the parallel and distributed implementation of the
              Protein Sequence-Structure Alignment Problem. This project will enhance the
              PI's extensive background in the field of parallel processing, to the new field
              of computational biology.  It is proposed that the work be done at the
              University of California Irvine where there are excellent research facilities
              available to support the study.
