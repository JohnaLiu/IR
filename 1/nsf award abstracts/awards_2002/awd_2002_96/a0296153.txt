This project concentrates on some estimates for linear and
              nonlinear
partial differential equations and their applications. It consists
              of
three main areas of research activity. In part one, the objective is 
to
              investigate some applications and generalizations of doubling property
for
              parabolic equations. The emphasis is on the behavior near the boundary
of
              positive solutions of second order parabolic equations.  In part two,
the goal
              is to derive some regularity estimates for fully nonlinear
equations with
              weaker (than concavity) condition. The a priori estimate
for fully nonlinear
              equations with concavity assumption is well developed.
The understanding of
              former would give some applications to
stochastic game theory, calibrated
              geometry, and nonlinear elasticity
theory. In part three, the aim is to study
              the best constant in an
isoperimetric inequality. There is a sharp
              isoperimetric inequality in the
Euclidean space with the standard flat metric.
              An interesting question is
the corresponding one in negatively curved space.
              An affirmative answer
would also give the sharp Sobolev inequality in the
              negatively curved
space.


The motivation of this project is to have some
              qualitative and quantative
information about our nature and society. Since
              partial differential
equations model and even describe many phenomena in our
              world. Estimates
for solutions of partial differential equations are what we
              need. Studying
the equations posed in this project is important for both
              practical and
theoretical purposes, and has broad applications in many fields,
              such as
heat transfer problems, chemical reaction, porous media, traffic
              flows,
biology, and economics.
