Abstract    :
              The investigators will study high frequency mode excitation in near-Earth space
              plasmas in the presence of low frequency waves, and to examine the significance
              of this mechanism on plasma energization and wave saturation.  The coupling of
              lower hybrid and ion acoustic modes with Alfven waves in the ring current and
              auroral zones is a particular area of emphasis.  The novelty of this research
              is in the generalization of the method developed for analysis of high frequency
              wave parametric excitation in plasmas of the near-Earth space environment. 
              Defining and understanding the physics of multi-component plasma is essential
              for the analysis of magnetospheric plasma phenomena
