CISE NGS: Middleware for
              Internet Workflow Management

Middleware is a software layer that allows
              applications to use the resources provided by a grid.  The middleware is
              expected to perform functions provided by the operating system of a computer,
              e.g. resources management and process management.  In case of a tightly coupled
              system, resource and process management is under the control of a scheduler,
              which manages and controls the allocation of all system resources to process
              competing for them.  The scheduler has accurate information about the System
              State.  The situation is quite different on a grid where resources are managed
              by autonomous entities and the scale of the system prevents any single entity
              from knowing accurately the state of the entire system.  This proposal is
              concerned with middleware for process or workflow management.
