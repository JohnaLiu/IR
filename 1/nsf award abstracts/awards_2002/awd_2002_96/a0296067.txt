Abstract    :
              9458081 Eom  This project is directed both at studying fundamental  materials
              science phenomena of oxides to gain atomic-level  understanding of these
              materials, and at exploring their  utilization in advanced integrated
              microelectronic, optical and  magnetic devices.  Our approach utilizes a
              UHV-compatible versatile  thin film deposition system which will be used to
              grow epitaxial  heterostructures.  This system will combine 90o off-axis 
              sputtering, on-axis sputtering, laser ablation, evaporation, and  etching in
              one chamber, and will also allow in situ deposition and  patterning of various
              types of structures.  %%% Oxide materials  possess an enormous range of
              properties and can be utilized for a  wide variety of applications involving
              superconductors,  dielectrics, ferroelectrics, ferromagnetics, and nonlinear
              optics  components.  The requirement by many advanced devices for epitaxial 
              multilayers with such mixed properties can potentially be achieved  with oxide
              thin film heterostructures. This study will provide a  guideline for the design
              of oxide multilayer device structures and  will also stimulate research into
              new oxide materials.  An  important feature of this research project is the
              training of  graduate and undergraduate students in a fundamentally and 
              technologically significant area of materials and processing  research.  ***
