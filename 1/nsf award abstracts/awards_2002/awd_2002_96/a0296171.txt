Abstract    :
              PI and CO-PI propose to design, grow, and characterize quantum-well dots. They
              propose to grow this novel structure by growing InP stressors on the top of
              barrier GaAs surface by molecular-beam epitaxy. The InP stressors modulate the
              quantum-well band-gap with local strain generating confinement potential. InP
              islands are formed due to a strain-induced 2D-3D transition, taking place,
              because of lattice misfit between the GaAs barrier and InP layer. They will
              characterize the structure by photoluminescence, excitation spectum, and
              time-resolved pump-probe technique. They will optimize the structure following
              his experimental results.
Since this is an untested and novel idea, a SGER
              grant is appropriate and crucial for them to obtain preliminary results on the
              quantum-well dots, and therefore to compete for NSF funding in the
              future.
These properly-designed quantum-well and double-quantum-barrier dots
              have applications in efficient THz emission and detection.
