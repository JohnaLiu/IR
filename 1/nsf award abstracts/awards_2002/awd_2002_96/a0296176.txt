A fundamental aspect of fold-thrust belt geometry is the
              presence of curved salients in which thrust traces are broadly convex towards
              the transport direction.  Although theoretical and physical analog models
              describe the general development of thrust belt salients, the 3-D kinematics
              and rates of deformation in salients are poorly understood.  This project will
              test existing models of salient development and develop new models using the
              Charleston-Nebo salient of the Sevier fold-thrust belt in north-central Utah,
              which preserves unusually well kinematic history without subsequent
              overprinting.  It is anticipated that the results will yield greater
              understanding of the kinematic history and rates of deformation within a thrust
              belt salient environment.
