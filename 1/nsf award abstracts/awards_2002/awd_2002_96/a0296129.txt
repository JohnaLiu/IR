Abstract    :
               Humans possess a highly developed ability to reason directly with diagrammatic
              information. Endowing a machine with similar capabilities could prove
              beneficial in the development of an artificially intelligent agent that
              interacts with a real world environment, rife with diagrammatic information,
              with a higher degree of autonomy than those without such capabilities. The goal
              of this research is to develop a theoretical basis for computing directly with
              diagrammatic representations (although the PI recognizes that diagrammatic
              representations may need to be augmented by other representations to completely
              represent many problem domains).  More specifically, this research proposes to
              examine how the spatial and temporal coherence often exhibited by groups of
              related diagrams could be leveraged for computational purposes.  Using concepts
              gleaned from set theory, image processing theory, color theory, and the theory
              of computation, like diagrams are combined in ways that produce new like
              diagrams that infer information implicit in the original diagrams.  This
              approach has been successful in producing diagrammatic solutions to problems in
              diverse contexts including heuristic development, spatial configuration,
              inductive learning, scheduling, and DNA sequencing. The PI and his students
              will consolidate this previous work with other research concerned with diagrams
              and computations, expand the current theory through rigorous investigation of
              its relationship with image processing theory, and test the applicability of
              the theory through the design and implementation of a diagram information
              system that allows users to pose queries concerning diagrams in a specified
              domain whose responses require information inferred from
              diagrams.
