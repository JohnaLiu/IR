Abstract    :
              The proposed work will use statistical optimal detection methods to improve the
              ratio of anthropogenic signal to internal climate variability and allow for an
              earlier detection of changes. 'Fingerprints' for the expected spatial and
              temporal evolution of changes in extremes will be derived from climate model
              simulations. A detection study first applying model data only, will be
              performed to explore which extreme value indices should show the earliest
              detectable changes. The PI will also examine which procedure of detection is
              most promising for an early detection of changes in extremes, as well as  which
              variable or combination of variables can and should be applied. The most
              promising procedure will be applied to observations. 

The focus is on
              temperature extremes, length of wet and dry periods and precipitation extremes,
              particularly over several days. Daily observations from land stations, mainly
              from the US, Canada, Europe, Russia, China and Japan will be used. The work is
              important because it will lead to increased understanding on climate change
              detection techniques.
