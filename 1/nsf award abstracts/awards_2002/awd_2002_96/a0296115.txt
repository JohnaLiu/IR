REU:  Performance
              Measurement and Evaluation of Multithreaded Systems

This Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site project supports seven students per
              year in programs carried out during the summers for three years.  The students
              work on projects involving multithreaded systems including work in performance
              measurement and evaluation, tuning of multithreaded systems and clusters of
              shared memory multiprocessors.  Students for the program are recruited
              nationwide, but the program focuses on students from institutions lacking
              research facilities in the Southeastern United States including several
              institutions with significant populations of underrepresented students.

Each
              REU participant is paired with one of the PIs or a post-doctoral research
              associate, and a graduate student working on the same project.  Educational
              activities include an organized 3-semester hour course on multithreading. 
              During their participation, the students are involved in literature search,
              writing critical reviews of technical papers, technical writing and oral
              presentations of their research.
