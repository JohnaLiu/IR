Abstract    :
              The last two decades have seen a resurgence in the interest of  investigating
              various neural models of computation.  Researchers  from various fields such as
              mathematics, computer science,  cognitive science and biology are either trying
              to analyze the  capabilities and limitations of various neural models, or 
              proposing extensions or modifications of current neural models to  make these
              models more consistent with applications in biology,  control theory, pattern
              recognition and other related areas.  Recent advanced mathematical techniques
              using results on semi-  algebraic sets, model theory, statistical methods and
              theory of  real numbers have enabled researchers to answer many theoretical 
              questions about neural models which were previously open. This  project
              continues further investigation of the capabilities and  limitations of various
              neural models, either from a theoretical  point of view using some of the
              advanced mathematical techniques  mentioned in the references, or from an
              experimental  point of  view.  The ultimate objective is to be able to provide
              further  insight into the working mechanisms of these models, and to  modify or
              extend existing models whenever appropriate.  The  theoretical investigations
              to be carried out in this project will  also be valuable in various practical
              application of neural  models.  This project involves interaction with
              undergraduate  students which should prepare them for possible graduate studies
               in mathematics, computer science and theoretical biology.
