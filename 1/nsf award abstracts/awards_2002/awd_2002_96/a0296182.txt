Abstract    :
              Despite the ubiquitous use of interactive web services, the technology
for
              programming such services has remained low-level, tedious and 
insecure. The
              overwhelmingly common method of extending web
servers with external
              applications is to use the Common Gateway Interface
protocol, which, while
              conceptually simple, has several known security
loopholes. 

The primary
              goal of this research is to establish type systems as the
fundamental
              methodology for reasoning about interactive web services,
and as a basis for
              designing and implementing tools that guarantee
security and reliability of
              these services. Some objectives of the
research are to:

(a) Provide tools
              to create secure programming environments for
interactive web services by
              building on existing tools and
infrastructure, notably the <bigwig> tools for
              interactive web
services developed at the University of Aarhus,
              Denmark.

(b) Implement prototype tools that check the satisfaction of
              security
policies (e.g., type-safety, memory-safety, secure information
              flow)
for interactive web services, and that provide feedback about
              failures.

(c) Foster fundamental progress in the area of modular
              program
analysis; this is not only essential for interactive web services
              (and
more generally, mobile software) because of their componential nature
of
              construction, but also has the potential to impact scalability and
efficiency
              of more conventional optimizing compilers as well.
