This exploratory project will investigate the development of
              fiber optic sensors to measure groundwater contaminant mass fluxes and
              cumulative contaminant-specific microbial activity in-situ and real time.  A
              novel, integrative mass-flux based assessment approach is proposed in
              preference to traditional concentration-based approaches.  Mass flux
              quantification is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of remediation,
              through either intrinsic (i.e., natural attenuation) or active (e.g., pump and
              treat of in situ flushing) means.  The contaminants of interest are chlorinated
              hydrocarbons, specifically TCE and PCE and their degradation products. 
              Quantification of contaminant mass flux will be especially useful in
              characterizing risks to humans and the environment from groundwater
              contamination.
