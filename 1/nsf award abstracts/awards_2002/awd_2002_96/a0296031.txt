Abstract    :
              This project will model the global energy input to the thermal plasma in the
              inner magnetosphere during storms and substorms.  It addresses several
              interesting and unresolved problems about the energy transfer between particles
              and waves and the thermal plasma.  These problems include the energy deposition
              of superthermal electrons to the thermal plasma, and the energy transfer
              between ring current ions and waves.  The investigations will utilize a code
              which has been developed over the past 6 or 7 years under a variety of NSF and
              NASA support.  This proposal utilizes the code particularly for storm-time
              modeling and will contribute to the GEM inner magnetosphere and storms
              campaign.
