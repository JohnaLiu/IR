Abstract    :
              0084886
This research addresses one of the long outstanding
fundamental
              problems in metallic glasses: microscopic mechanisms of
deformation. Metallic
              glass deforms in highly localized zones called
shear bands. The inability to
              spread the local deformation
is the dominant factor affecting the fracture
              strength, toughness,
and widespread applications of amorphous metals. The aim
              of this
work is to search and identify defects that promote
deformation in
              amorphous metals. To answer the challenges
posed by the lack of long-range
              order in amorphous materials, we plan 
to use extensive, multiscale computer
              simulations.
We will develop algorithms to characterize free
              volumes,
non-equilibrium simulation methods to model local heat
              dissipation,
techniques to identify extended defects such as
              dislocations,
and finally, development of stochastic dynamic method to
              model
shear band propagation on mesoscopic scale. We expect the
knowledge
              generated from the multiscale simulations to lay a
foundation for the future
              development of theoretical models,
and provide guidance to experiments in
              synthesis, testing
and application of metallic glasses and their composites
