              ABSTRACT

OCE-0117437

A researcher from Cornell University plans to measure
              the hafnium (Hf) isotopic composition (176Hf/177Hf) and eHf values (isotopic
              composition of Hf normalized to CHUR, a chondrite with a 176Hf/177Hf ratio of
              0.282772) of seawater samples recovered from both the Atlantic (North Atlantic
              Deep Water, Arctic Intermediate Water, Mediterranean Outflow Water and modified
              Antarctic Intermediate and Deep Water) and Pacific Ocean (Equatorial Water,
              Arctic Intermediate Water, North Central Pacific Water and Ocean Common Water).
               In addition, the PI will analyze hydrothermal fluids from 9'N on the East
              Pacific Rise and metalliferous sediments collected from the Nazca Plate.  The
              goal of these measurements is to provide new insights into the geochemistry of
              this element and ascertain that ferromanganese crusts indeed record the
              composition of Hf in seawater.  If ferromanganese crust record seawater Hf
              concentrations, then the PI contends that the isotopic composition of Hf can be
              used as a paleo indicator of weathering intensity.
