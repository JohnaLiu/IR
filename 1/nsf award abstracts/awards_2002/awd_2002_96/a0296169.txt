ITR:  New Approaches to
              Human Capital Development through Information Technology Research

The
              objective of this project is to discover effective mechanisms for reducing the
              disparity
between the technological haves and have-nots, in terms of
              employability, income and societal
participation (aka The Digital Divide).
              Since a disproportionately large number of African-Americans fall in the
              category of have-nots, we have taken on the "so-called" African
              American
Problem as our research challenge. Recent data suggest that Hispanic
              Americans have begun to
close the gap in the Digital Divide. However, this is
              not the case for African Americans.
Despite years of affirmative action and
              targeted programs, African Americans as a group have not
benefited in
              proportion to the resources expended. The Internet, the World Wide Web, and
              new
information technologies are powerful engines for change and rapid
              technological change tends to
exacerbate pre-existing social and economic
              conditions. Thus, the "Digital Divide" continues to
grow because it is firmly
              supported by existing racial, economic and social divides, despite what
appear
              to be grand efforts to the contrary. Our project will implement a
              multidisciplinary
approach to the solution of the Digital Divide problem for
              African Americans through basic
research in information technology,
              distributed systems, human computer interfaces, and
collaboration technologies
              with a central emphasis on how culture expresses itself in and
influences
              information technologies. We will utilize our results to develop technologies
              that
diminish the Digital Divide.

In this project we will conduct basic
              research in distributed systems, information retrieval, human
computer
              interfaces, collaboration technologies, social/cultural preferences of African
              Americans,
public policy analysis and culture-specific pedagogies and
              assessments. A unifying framework
for our project is the development of a
              culture-specific, distributed, distance learning system for
African Americans
              based on the single-learner multiple-teacher model. Our basic research
              is
complemented by a number of educational technology development projects and
              community
deployment assessments.
