Abstract    :
              
The objective of the proposed research is the thorough understanding of
              
fundamental phenomena in dynamic fracture of homogeneous and bimaterial
              systems 
subjected to high shearing loads. Recent experimental evidence during
              shear 
dominated crack propagation along interfaces, has shown the development
              of 
supersonic crack speeds and crack face contact. In addition, theoretical
              
evidence predicts supersonic speeds even in homogeneous materials, under high
              
shear loading, if the homogeneous material exhibits a cohesive type failure
              
response. Here, experimental and numerical analysis will be conducted to
              
scrutinize the physical details of the contact zone and of limiting crack
              speeds
in bimaterial interface and homogeneous material systems. Special
              emphasis will 
be placed on the issue of crack face friction and subsequent
              heating during 
contact. The educational part of this proposal describes a
              plan for improvement 
of teaching practices in current courses and enhanced
              undergraduate 
laboratories, including animated classroom presentations as
              well as physical 
demonstrations of counter-intuitive dynamical systems.
