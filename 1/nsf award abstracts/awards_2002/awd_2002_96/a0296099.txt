Abstract    :
              This award supports the investigation of the discharge variablility of Ross Ice
              Streams over the last millenium, using a combination of numerical simulation
              and satellite remote sensing of flow features on the Ross Ice Shelf.  The
              proposed collaborative research will use the Ross Ice Shelf record of flow
              variability to deduce variations in ice stream discharge over the last 1000
              years.  Changes in ice stream discharge disrupt flow of the ice shelf, in both
              profound and subtle ways, distorting flow features and changing crevasse
              patterns.  The result in an integrated record of many changes over the lifetime
              of the ice within the shelf.  Interpretations of flow-trace and crevasse
              geometry already made by Fahnestock and others will be used as a template for
              the design of numerical modeling experiments.  The primary objectives are to
              verify the imagery existing concepts of ice stream dishcarge variability and
              will produce new data sets, both which will be use to the Antarctic glaciology
              community.  Landsat-7 imagery will be used to measure velocity in areas of
              particular interest where existing data are inadequate.  MODIS data, which has
              better radiometric and spatial resolution will be used to improve feature
              mapping on the ice shelf in sensitive areas.
