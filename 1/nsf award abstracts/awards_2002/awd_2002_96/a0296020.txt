This project addresses some problems in transport equations,
              Godunov 
type central schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws, classical and
              
nonlinear approximation. The common thread that runs through the 
proposed
              research is the use of techniques from approximation theory, 
harmonic and
              functional analysis (Littlewood-Paley theory, wavelet 
decompositions, maximal
              functions, interpolation and K-functionals) to 
prove analytic results in
              other areas of applied mathematics and to use 
these techniques to develop
              numerical methods. Particular emphases will 
be placed on several issues:
              development of a satisfactory theory for linear 
transport equations in
              several space dimensions which arise when 
linearizing the nonlinear problem,
              development of Godunov type central 
schemes for solving multidimensional
              systems of conservation laws, and 
application of these schemes to various
              problems and models. Extensions 
of averaging lemmas to go from microscopic to
              macroscopic formulations 
will also be of primary concern.  A portion of this
              project will address 
fundamental questions in nonlinear approximation and
              multivariate 
cubature.

The areas under discussion (nonlinear
              approximation, analytical properties 
of solutions to transport equations and
              development of effective numerical 
methods for their computation) are of
              significant practical interest. The 
applications include image processing,
              statistical estimation, fluid 
mechanics, geophysics, meteorology,
              astrophysics, multi-component 
flows, ground water flow, semiconductors, and
              reactive flows.
