New developments in telecommunication systems, wireless
              networks, manufacturing, and elsewhere place severe demands on the design of
              advanced discrete-time adaptive controllers.  Therefore, discrete-time version
              of controller techniques is of importance since all the controller
              implementations are carried out on a digital computer.  Further, the
              performance requirements for complex nonlinear systems including industrial,
              DoD are becoming more stringent due to rapid advances in sensors, hardware, and
              more importantly the regulations imposed on these systems due to environmental
              concerns.  The result is a complex large-scale distributed modern day system. 
              Adaptive and neural network (AN) control tools and sensor technologies hold out
              promise of improved learning under uncertainty, vibration suppression, precise
              motion control and micro object manipulation, microsensor development, deadzone
              compensation, diagnostics/prognostics and more.

The goal of this project is
              to provide a next generation controller, which should be able to interface to a
              wide variety of sensors, allowing reconfiguration and rapid prototyping
              capabilities, has guaranteed performance, and is supported by a rigorous and
              repeatable design and mathematical framework, to include:
	
Development and
              Implementation of Advanced Real-Time Feedback Controllers for Machine Level
              Operations.

Development and Implementation of Microsensor-based
              Assembly/Control of MEMS devices and Systems.
	
Development and
              Implementation of Sensor-based Adaptive Controllers for Diagnostic/Prognostic
              Applications.

Development and Implementation of Real-Time Adaptive
              Controllers for Communication Networks.
