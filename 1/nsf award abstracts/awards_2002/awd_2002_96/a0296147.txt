	Of
              the parasitoid wasps important in attacking and regulating populations of
              caterpillars, perhaps the most familiar and numerically dominant are wasps
              belonging to the microgastroid complex.  This complex of braconid wasps
              comprises eight subfamilies, several of which have already been demonstrated to
              carry hereditary polydnaviruses which compromise host Immune systems, and none
              of which have been shown not to carry the viruses.  Since these viruses are
              crucial to the wasp/caterpillar parasitic relationship, they are of
              considerable evolutionary, physiological and economic
              interest.

	Phylogenetic analysis of braconid wasps based on comparative
              morphology and on 16S and 28S rRNA sequence data indicates that the
              microgastroids form a monophyletic lineage probably dating back at least 60
              million years.  Preliminary results of phylogenetic analysis of 16S and NADH1
              DNA sequence data, from wasps in the genus Cotesia, and of the genes EP1 and
              Crv1 from the viruses they carry, suggest that the phylogeny of the
              polydnaviruses mirrors that of their wasp carriers, at least within this
              group.

	This project will more fully address whether this expected parallel
              phylogeny really exists by obtaining DNA sequences from the 16S, NADH1 and CO1
              genes in the genomes of a further 25 species of microgastrines, and comparing
              the phylogeny obtained from these to that estimated from the EP1 and CrV1 genes
              of the viruses they carry.  The results will have important implications for
              the use of phylogeny to predict aspects of the host-parasitoid relationship in
              this large, economically important  group of wasps.
