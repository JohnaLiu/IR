This work will use direct numerical simulation to examine
              the 
processes by which obliquely incident internal waves reflect from a
              
sloping boundary, generate currents flowing along the slope, and 
interact
              with these currents.  These processes are important in the 
production of
              mixing near boundaries and hence have an effect on the 
ocean that extends far
              beyond the immediate vicinity of the boundary.  The details of boundary mixing
              are difficult to observe in the field and in the lab.  Both monochromatic and
              polychromatic incident wave fields will be considered.  Key questions to be
              investigated are the time-dependent behavior of the strong along-slope currents
              generated by waves near the critical frequency and the way in which the spatial
              distribution of regions of strong mixing evolves.
