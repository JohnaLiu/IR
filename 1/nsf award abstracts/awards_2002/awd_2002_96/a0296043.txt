Abstract    :
              This award is for a collaborative experiment (University of Minnesota and Iowa
              State University) using a Coupled Land Atmosphere Simulation Program (CLASP) to
              make direct comparisons between simulated paleo lake-levels and hydrochemistry
              with those inferred from high-resolution lake-core records. The study will
              quantitatively evaluate how aquifer systems influence lake-level fluctuations
              within glaciated watersheds by applying CLASP to the well studied Crow Wing
              watershed in north-central Minnesota and by comparing the CLASP model results
              to paleoclimatic reconstructions from proxy records preserved in lake
              sediments. By simulating the hydrologic fluctuations of individual lakes and
              streams, the model will permit the most comprehensive evaluation of paleo
              atmospheric general circulation model reconstruction of Holocene climatic
              change at the regional scale.
