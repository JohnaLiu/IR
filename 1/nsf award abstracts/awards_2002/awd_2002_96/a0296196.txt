Abstract    :
              This project deals with the design of highly mobile wireless  systems where not
              only end-users are mobile, but also the base  stations that serve these
              end-users are mobile. The mobility of  base stations introduces several
              challenging problems in the  design and development of such systems. In this
              project, highly  mobile wireless architectures with capability for intelligent 
              survivability and adaptive connectivity in an unpredictable  environments will
              be researched. Contributions will be made to the  foundation of intelligent
              highly mobile wireless network and  computing systems design, including network
              architecture, digital  information storage, intelligent distributed adaptive 
              reconfiguration, network routing, location management, channel  allocation, and
              information security. Intelligent agents capable  of taking autonomous
              decisions under uncertainty and approximate  knowledge, capable of adapting to
              changing operating conditions  (low bandwidth, changing topology and
              connectivity, and node  failures and mobility, etc.) will be researched. An
              architecture  and a set of relevant protocols will be designed and tested on a 
              simulation testbed. An extensive performance evaluation and  prediction will be
              conducted to evaluate, predict, and optimize  the performance of the developed
              architectures, protocols, and  algorithms.
