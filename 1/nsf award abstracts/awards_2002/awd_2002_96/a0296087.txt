Abstract    :
              This project will analyze Cenozoic deep sea sediments for their content of 3 He
              in fullereness and in mineral phases in order to partition the 3 He budget
              among terrestrial and extraterrestrial phases, and to assess the variation in
              extraterrestrial flux of noble gases to the planet.
