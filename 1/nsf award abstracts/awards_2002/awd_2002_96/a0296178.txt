Abstract    :
              The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a unique
              chloride channel found in epithelial cells throughout the body.  While
              functionally an ion channel, structurally CFTR belongs to a family of
              ATPase-dependent transporters known as ABC transporters.  CFTR, however, is the
              only known member to function primarily as an ion channel.  Because of its
              unique molecular evolution, the CFTR channel is an interesting and important
              model for biophysical studies of ion channel structure and function.  The
              experiments that comprise this project are based on preliminary studies which
              show that the gating of the channel is altered by the reduction/oxidation
              (redox) state of the protein.  The experiments use a combination of molecular
              biological and electrophysiological techniques to examine the role of
              redox-sensitive cysteine residues in modulating channel gating.  The results
              will be used to identify domain interactions within the protein that are
              important for channel function.  The major hypotheses to be tested are (1) that
              gating of the channel is influenced by the redox state of specific cysteine
              residues which if mutated change channel properties, (2) that reintroducing
              cysteines into strategic areas of mutated proteins will restore normal activity
              and will help identify regions of the protein important for channel function,
              and (3) that nitric oxide, when produced by cells, acts as an endogenous redox
              regulator of the CFTR channel.  The research will involve the direct
              participation of undergraduates, and thus will enhance both the research and
              educational environment of the Biology Department at Morehouse College
