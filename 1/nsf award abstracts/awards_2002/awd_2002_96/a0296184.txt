              ABSTRACT

The main theme of the project is to develop the theory of fourth
              order
equations arising from conformal geometric considerations. The
              first
part of the project seeks to apply the fourth order equation as
              
regularizing equations of the more natural but more difficult
              fully
nonlinear partial differential equations in conformal geometry.
The
              first consequence will be natural conformal criteria for the
existence of a
              conformal metric of positive Ricci curvature. The second
part of the project
              seeks to widen the set of conformal classes to which
our theory of fourth
              order equations may be applied. A concrete problem
would be to find saddle
              point solutions of the fourth order equations
on a large class of four
              dimensional conformal structures of negative
scalar curvature. The third part
              of the proposed project is to develop
the theory of biharmonic maps in four
              dimension. It is proposed to
develop a classification of biharmonic maps of
              special conformal
structures. 

The several parts of this proposal share a
              common novel feature to
consider a fourth order nonlinear differential
              equation that relates
fourth order term of a scalar quantity to the scalar
              quantity itself.
The equation came from geometric considerations for a four
              dimensional
space that are natural from topological perspective. The
              project
will have an impact on the development of higher order
              differential
equations in several ways. First it will introduce new
              techniques
to study the solutions of such equations. Secondly, it will yield
              new
methods to solve the more traditional second order equations of
              geometric
interest. Thirdly, the results have aleady yield application to
              the
geometry of four dimensional space.
