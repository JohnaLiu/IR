Abstract    :
              This grant supports an ongoing research program investigating aerosols, clouds,
              and precipitation, using the unique capabilities of the Facility for
              Atmospheric Remote Sensing (FARS) at the University of Utah.  Instruments
              include visible, infrared, and microwave radiometers, a ruby (0.694 micrometres
              wavelength) Cloud Polarization Lidar (CPL), a scanning dual-wavelength (0.532
              and 1.06 micrometres) high-resolution Polarization Diversity Lidar (PDL), and a
              W-band (3.2 millimetres) polarimetric Doppler radar.  To this battery of
              equipment will be added a nitrogen Raman channel for the PDL, which will enable
              the determination of the aerosol extinction coefficient independently of the
              backscattering coefficient, and provision for scanning the PDL in elevation, to
              study the shapes and orientations of hydrometeors and the anisotropy of clouds
              as scattering media.  Emphasis to now has been on improving fundamental
              understanding of midlatitude cirrus clouds by monitoring their spectral
              scattering and emission properties as they move over the FARS site.  New
              objectives include the study of precipitation development in mixed-phase (ice
              and water) clouds, investigations of the shapes and orientations of ice
              crystals as revealed by their optical and microwave properties, and studies of
              the optical properties and vertical structure of aerosol layers that originate
              from local and sometimes distant sources. The work is highly relevant to the
              interpretation of present and proposed satellite remote sensing measurements
              and to the treatment of clouds and aerosols in climate models.
