Abstract    :
              9625070  Mirmiran  This is a CAREER Award.    The research plan will focus on
              hybrid construction with concrete  and fiber composites in systems with
              pseudo-ductile behavior with  high stiffness and strength.  The plan will
              include analytical  and experimental components.    The education plan will
              synergize the research results into the  classroom teaching which will allow to
              the students and the  faculty person to be at the peaks of knowledge in a
              specific  topic.  ***
