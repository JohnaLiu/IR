Abstract    :
              This research is an investigation into fundamental aspects of computer-aided 
              design of VLSI circuits.  Topics include high level synthesis, logic synthesis 
              and physical design, with an emphasis on the application of modern
              combinatorial  optimization technique for the solution of complex design
              automation problems   The research has two orthogonal themes, one in low power
              design in high level and  logic synthesis, and the other in algorithmic
              approaches to physical design  problems.  The second theme is computational
              technique oriented, showing how  techniques such as linear, integer and convex
              programming and network flow can  be applied to the solution of design
              automation problems.
