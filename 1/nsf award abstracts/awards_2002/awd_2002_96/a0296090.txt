Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry   Program
              supports research in the laboratories of Dr. Trevor Douglas at   Temple
              University. The research involves the in vitro self-assembly of   cowpea
              chlorotic mottle virus protein subunits into icosahedral particles   with
              cavity sizes of 110, 180, 320, or 550 angstroms. These viron cages   will be
              used for the template directed synthesis of discretely sized iron   oxide
              particles. The coat protein will be modified, via site-directed   mutagensis
              and chemical derivatization, to enhance metal binding by   introducing
              histidine, cysteine, glutamic acid, catechol or phosphate   moieties. Magnetite
              or maghemite nanoparticles will then be grown inside   the native or derivative
              viron cage. Structural characterization of the   nanoparticles will be
              accomplished using electron diffraction and   high-resolution transmission
              electron microscopy. Size and temperature   dependent magnetic characteristics
              of the iron oxide particles will be   examined via SQUID magnetometry and
              Mossbauer spectroscopy.  The use of viron architecture to entrap inorganic
              guests is expected to   produce inorganic particles in a range of discrete
              sizes exhibiting   properties tailored for their use. This research is expected
              to have   applications in the fields of magnetic separation, magnetic resonance
                imaging, and miniaturized information storage.
