Mantle metasomatism is an important mechanism by which trace
              elements are transported from one mantle region to another and likely involves
              agents ranging from silicate or carbonate melts to solute-rich hydrous fluids. 
              It is not clear which agents are responsible for so-called cryptic
              metasomatism, for which otherwise difficult-to-explain trace element or
              isotopic features are the only evidence. Recent experimental work has
              identified a likely agent of cryptic metasomatism:  highly silicic, aluminous,
              alkaline liquids with compositions like those of so-called extreme-composition
              glasses found in many mantle xenoliths worldwide.  These results lead to the
              inference that such glasses represent liquids that were generated by partial
              melting of a pre-enriched mantle protolith, and could in fact migrate through
              the upper mantle and transport elements.  To extend this work to an examination
              of the possible trace-element signatures they can impart, this study will
              determine partitioning behavior between these liquids and mantle minerals. It
              will provide more accurate information on how these liquids might transport
              trace elements, elucidate the role of liquid composition on trace element
              partitioning behavior, and refine parameterizations of partitioning data that
              can yield predictive relationships for trace element partitioning as functions
              of pressure, temperature, and mineral and melt compositions.
