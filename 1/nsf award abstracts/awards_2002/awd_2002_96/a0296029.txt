Abstract    :
              The PI is developing a complete kinetic description of ionospheric plasma
              outflows from the collision-dominated region to the collisionless
              magnetospheric plasma, providing continuous self-consistent coupling processes
              between the different components of ionospheric plasmas along open and closed
              geomagnetic field lines.  This continued research, important for defining and
              understanding plasma physics manifested in phenomena of the coupled
              ionosphere-magnetosphere system, helps to develop a complete picture of
              near-Earth space.
