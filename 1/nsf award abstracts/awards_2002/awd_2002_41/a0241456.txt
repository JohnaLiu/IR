Abstract    :
              This exploratory research project investigates the utilization of stochastic
              analyses methods on bioinspired networks of sensors in structures. This network
              will be able to interpret sensor signals that monitor substructures critical to
              overall stability and integrity.  The bio-network will be developed at the
              nano, micro and meso scale and produce information about the structure and its
              enclosed environment in a hierarchical fashion.  Additionally, these sensors
              could also monitor environmental factors, personnel mobility among other
              things. A stochastic analyses technique will be utilized to determine the
              probability of failure, where that failure occurs and to what extent the
              structure has failed. The methodology could also be used to determine random
              variation from the normal operating range of the signals, thereby developing a
              multifaceted picture of the structure state.
