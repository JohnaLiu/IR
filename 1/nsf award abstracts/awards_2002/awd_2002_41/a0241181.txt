              PROJECT ABSTRACT                     0241181

This award support the CCW Rice
              Genome Sequencing Consortium [Clemson Univ.
Genomics Institute (CUGI), Cold
              Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) and Washington
Univ. Genome Sequencing Center
              (WUGSC)] to continue their rice genome sequencing project that was funded in
              October 1999. The original goal of the project was to production
sequence,
              finish and annotate approximately 20 Mb of rice genomic DNA on the short
arms
              of chromosomes 10 and 3 as part of the International Rice Genome
              Sequencing
Project (IRGSP). Chromosome 10 is essentially finished and a joint
              manuscript is in preparation. Chromosome 3 is in progress. In collaboration
              with the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR), the specific objectives of this
              award is to completely sequence, finish, annotate and publish rice chromosomes
              3. 

The specific goals are: 1) to generate a Phase II draft of rice
              chromosome 3 (~75% done already with current funding) by December 2002; and 2)
              completely finish rice chromosome 3 by September 2003, in collaboration with
              TIGR, in support of the ultimate IRGSP objective of depositing a finished rice
              genome in GenBank.  

An outline of research plan is: 
A) Forty-four ~143kb
              Nipponbare BAC clones (CUGI/Monsanto) anchored to the short
arm of chromosome
              3 will be validated for insert integrity and chromosomal location
B) Library
              development and production sequencing (10X) of the 44 BAC clones will
              be
performed 
C) 44 production sequenced BACs will be finished 
D) finishing
              technology development aimed at establishing robust chemistries and protocols
              that can be used by the consortium to finish difficult regions of the rice
              genome.
E) 44 finished BACs will be phase I annotated 

All sequence data
              will be publicly released according to the "Bermuda" policies.
