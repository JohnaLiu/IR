Abstract    :
              This study will involve petrographic work, mineral chemical analysis (major and
              trace elements), and Hf, Os, Sr, Pb, and Nd isotope study of mineral separates
              from spinel peridotite and garnet "pyroxenite suite" xenoliths from the
              post-erosional Honolulu Volcanics (HV) of Oahu. The xenoliths come from three
              vents: Salt Lake crater (SLC) is located on the rim of the Koolau volcano; and
              Kaau and Pali vents are located close to its caldera. The first order goal
              under this award is to infer xenolith origins using the combined isotopic and
              mineral chemical information. The isotopic information and mineral
              thermobarometry on the xenoliths will allow the PIs to recognize the types of
              materials (subducted crust and mantle or even lower mantle or transition zone
              materials) that may have been brought up by the Hawaiian plume versus those
              that have a lithospheric origin. The study will offer a direct insight into the
              isotopic variability of the shallow mantle beneath Oahu irrespective of their
              origin in the plume, the lithosphere, or as a mixed product of plume,
              lithosphere or asthenosphere- derived components. Once these are identified,
              existing models on Hawaiian volcanism and lithospheric processes may be
              fine-tuned or better models may be proposed.
