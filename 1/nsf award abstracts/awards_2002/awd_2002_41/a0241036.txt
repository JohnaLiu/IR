              ABSTRACT

OCE-0241036

The nonlinear interactions between jets and mesoscale
              eddies will be studied in order to improve the conceptual understanding of the
              Brazil-Malvinas Confluence Zone.  In particular, the role of Agulhas eddies in
              causing the drift of the Confluence Zone and also in the detachment of
              intrusion eddies will be examined. Analytical and numerical techniques will be
              used in process-oriented studies. The research will be guided and compared to
              observations, regional numerical models and with laboratory experiments. This
              study will have important implications for our understanding of interbasin
              exchanges of energy, heat and momentum and the ocean's role in the meridional
              transport of heat. It therefore will aid our understanding of the climate
              system.
