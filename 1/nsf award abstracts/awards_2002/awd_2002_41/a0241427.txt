The grant provides funding for
              the PI to host a planning workshop to develop a collaborative research project
              on "Firm-level Gender Inequalities in Transitional Societies.  Intra-firm level
              analysis is necessary to answer some of the most pressing questions about
              merging social inequalities in post-state socialists countries.  The resultant
              project will propose to use cutting-edge techniques tp complete firm level
              analysis that can address the issue of whether and how men and women are
              allocated into different job categories and what effect this  allocation has on
              earning.  The major goal of the research is to better understand the mechanisms
              behind such processes, which will increase our knowledge of the causes and
              consequences of occupational segregation by gender and gender wage gap in both
              transitional societies and advanced market economies.  Research on the effects
              of gender as an ascriptive category on labor market chances could guide future
              research in the area of gender stratification, occupational mobility and labor
              market inequalities.  A project on firm-level gender inequalities would also
              inform labor policy aimed at reducing discrimination in hire, promotion, and
              wage setting.  The workshop will include invited scholars from the post-state
              socialist region, as well as experts in the fields of gender inequality and
              intra-firm analysis.  During the workshop participants will explore
              country-specific data availability, as well as methodological and theoretical
              challenges of completing a comparative research project on the topic.  The
              objective the workshop is to develop a collaborative comparative research
              agenda on firm level gender inequalities in transitional societies.
