Space-time
              (multiple antenna) techniques offer a variety of leverages to improve wireless
              systems performance. These include diversity, spatial multiplexing and
              interference reduction. Wireless standards bodies are incorporating space-time
              techniques into new standards. However, many existing wireless systems such as
              GSM and IS-95 rely on a single transmit and receive antenna (SISO) and
              therefore cannot benefit from space-time technology. This proposal aims to
              develop a novel approach that brings many of the benefits of space-time
              technology to SISO wireless by introducing an intermediate node with multiple
              receive and multiple transmit antennas. We characterize a SISO link with an
              intermediate node as a SI(MM)SO link. In such links, there is also the
              possibility of a SISO link bypass to the SI(MM)SO link. 

The research
              objectives are 
 
1.  Characterizing Shannon channel capacity of SI(MM)SO
              channels with bypass. 
2.  Space-time processing schemes at the intermediate
              node. 
3.  Extensions of the SI(MM)SO idea to MIMO channels. 
 
While
              theoretical work is the primary goal of this proposal, experimental support is
              available and can help measure real SI(MM)SO channels.
