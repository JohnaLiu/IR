Abstract    :
              This project supports three summer conferences on political methodology. The
              conferences constitute the 20th thru 22nd such meetings, which have been
              sponsored by NSF and university host institutions since 1986. Each meeting
              brings together approximately 100 faculty and graduate students. There are
              several aims of the conferences. First, they provide a forum for state of the
              art political methodology by allowing scholars to present the newest methods in
              the field for discussion and debate. Second, they provide a forum where
              scholars in the field can debate and agree on best practices in different
              areas, which can then be disseminated to the field. Third, they enhance
              graduate training by exposing them to the state of the art in a fast-moving
              field, rather than leaving them believing that what they have read in older
              articles is the best available technology for dealing with estimation and
              specification issues in political science. Fourth, they allow junior faculty to
              receive state of the art training and advice on specific research problems.
              Fifth, they provide mentors ship opportunities and networks for new scholars,
              whether they are graduate students or junior faculty.  The conferences are
              regarded widely as the best mechanisms for advancing methodology in political
              science.
