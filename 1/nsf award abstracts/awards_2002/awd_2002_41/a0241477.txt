Effects Of Elevated Atmospheric CO2 On Plant
              Detritus Nutritional Quality And Heterotrophic Utilization In Aquatic
              Ecosystems

The influence of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels on
              aquatic ecosystems is relatively ignored compared to research occurring in
              terrestrial systems.  The proposed research will examine the influence of
              leaves grown under elevated carbon dioxide levels on stream microbial
              communities and selected small animals and insects.  Aspen trees will be grown
              under identical conditions except one set will be exposed to elevated carbon
              dioxide.  The microbial colonization of these two sets of leaves in streams
              will be studied to determine how leaf quality affects utilization and loss of
              leaf litter.  This processed litter will then be fed to crustaceans and insects
              to determine a potential impact of global change.
