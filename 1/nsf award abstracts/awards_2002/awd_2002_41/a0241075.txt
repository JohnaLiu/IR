Abstract    :
              This research will explore the potential for measuring  Sr/Ca ratios in coral
              skeletons deposited during the night as a reliable proxy for sea-surface
              temperature (SST).   The work will test the hypothesis that Sr/Ca in aragonite
              deposited during the daytime contains a vital effect due to algal symbionts but
              that aragonite deposited during the night is in thermodynamic equilibrium with
              ambient SST.  PIs will first identify portions of coral skeleton in modern
              corals deposited during nighttime and then use SIMS ion microprobe to calibrate
               Sr/Ca as a proxy for SST.  After the calibration studies are done Sr/Ca will
              be measured in nighttime aragonite from fossil corals recovered from Barbados
              and Vanuatu to determine tropical SST during the last glacial.
