Abstract    :
              This research will develop new statistical methodologies and models for the
              analysis of categorical response data that occur frequently in the social and
              behavioral sciences.  The main objective is to address some statistical issues
              that are related to the analysis of complex longitudinal and heterogeneous data
              when standard models such as the generalized linear models are inadequate.  The
              research will explore several distinct modeling issues including, among others,
              parametric transformations of independent variables (covariates), the
              development of growth curve models for large-scale longitudinal social study
              data, and adapting heteroscedasticity in generalized linear models with
              non-parametrically scaled link functions.  New methods and algorithms in
              estimations and inferences will be developed, including: 1) developing a
              general computing method for estimating transformation and regression
              parameters in covariate transformation models; 2) providing a
              stochastic-approximation-based computing algorithm for general mixed-effects
              models; and 3) developing efficient estimating equations for models with
              non-parametrically scaled link functions.  The research also will develop
              large-sample-based supporting theories for the proposed methodologies.  The
              research topics originally stemmed from some specific consulting projects in
              the social and behavioral sciences, but the methodologies to be developed are
              very general, with potential applications to many complex data analysis
              problems.
