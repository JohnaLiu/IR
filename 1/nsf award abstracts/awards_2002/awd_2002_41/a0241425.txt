This research project,
              supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focuses on the use
              of hyperthermal polyatomic ions to form specific organic thin films.  Using
              mass-selected and non-mass selected ion sources, the growth of thiophenic thin
              films is examined.  The effects of ion energy, ion fluence, ion-neutral ratio
              in the source beam, and ion structure are correlated with properties of the
              grown thin film.  Fundamental information about how organic films can be grown
              from characterized ion sources is useful for the development of organic
              electronic devices, flexible solar energy cells, and the understanding of
              related plasma processing methods.  Professor Hanley and his colleagues at the
              University of Illinois-Chicago have developed a unique capability to carry out
              these studies.  

With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, Professor Hanley and his coworkers at the University of
              Illinois-Chicago are examining the growth of organic films using polyatomic ion
              sources.  Unique polythiophenic films that may have application in flexible
              solar cell devices have been constructed, and the fundamental understanding of
              the growth of these films is being pursued.  Ion beam characteristics are
              compared with the morphology and properties of the grown films in this work.
