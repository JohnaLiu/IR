                     ABSTRACT

OCE-0241916




Recent studies have implied that winds
              over the Southern Ocean can influence ocean circulation far away from the
              Southern Ocean itself. In particular, the deep meridional overturning
              circulation may be driven by windstress over the Southern Ocean. This
              circulation is thought to influence global climate through the transport of
              heat. This study will examine how interannual variations of the winds over the
              Southern Oceans may drive significant variability in the global ocean
              circulation. The project will use numerical and analytical models to consider
              how changes in wind intensity, or the latitude of the maximum winds causes
              changes in the circulation. The variability of the deep meridional overturning
              circulation has important consequences for the variability of climate.
              Understanding the causes of this variability will have important implications
              for climate prediction. This study has direct relevance to the goals of the
              Climate Variability program.
