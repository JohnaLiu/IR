Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project constructs a hierarchical logistic regression
              model for the mean of a binary response variable conditional on
              poststratification cell.  The object is to produce congressional district-level
              opinions from national surveys. 

This approach combines the modeling
              approach often used in small-area estimation with the population information
              used in poststratification. The NSF dissertation research grant
will be used
              to purchase data from the US Census Bureau to obtain reliable estimates of the
              joint population distributions of sex, ethnicity, age, and  education at the
              congressional district-level. In order to poststratify on all the variables
              listed above, along with the congressional district, we need the joint
              population distribution of the demographic variables within each congressional
              district.  Currently, the U.S. Census only provides without charge the joint
              distributions of sex, ethnicity, and age.  The model has produced reliable
              measures that the state-level.
