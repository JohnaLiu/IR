This project will study the circulation of the various layers
              lying beneath the Intermediate water.  This will follow from the results of the
              separate studies of the top-to-bottom circulation of the Atlantic, Pacific, and
               Indian oceans (Reid, 1994, 1997, and in press).  Some preliminary work has
              been done on the overturning streamlines in the three oceans . These deeper
              layers include the warm, saline,  oxygen-rich  and nutrient-poor waters formed
              in the northern  North Atlantic and the less-saline and  colder  waters formed
              around Antarctica and in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea.  The shallowest of these
              layers is the North Atlantic Deep Water.  This very saline layer can be
              recognized throughout the Atlantic Ocean, along the Antarctic circumpolar
              current, and extending northward into the Indian and Pacific oceans. 

The
              work  will be done  by  examining the patterns of salinity, oxygen, and silica
              along isopycnal surfaces and on vertical sections. The work should have a broad
              impact on studies of exchanges of water, heat, salt, and nutrients both
              vertically and among  the three oceans.  It may provide a background against
              which the various climate studies can be examined.  One of the problems in
              studying ocean circulation is that it is possible to achieve models that
              balance heat transport and mass but do not have realistic flow patterns, and
              that results based upon geostrophic shear and tracers (Reid's work in the three
              oceans) may have balanced total transport and realistic flow patterns but do
              not balance heat transport or circulation within layers.
