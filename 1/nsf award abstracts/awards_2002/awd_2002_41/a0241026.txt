Abstract    :
               This proposal request support to partially fund acquisition of an inductively
              coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer, which will supplement existing
              analytical capabilities at Rutgers University.  The new instrument will be
              primarily used for elemental rations (e.g., Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca) in foraminifers
              and other biogenic carbonates in support of paleoceanographic research.  The
              new instrument will also be available to researchers and students in the
              Department of Geology and Department of Environmental Sciences at the
              university for projects that do not require the high-sensitivity and resolution
              of ICP-MS.  The instrument will serve as a training tool for students in the
              Earth and environmental sciences at both the undergraduate and graduate level.
