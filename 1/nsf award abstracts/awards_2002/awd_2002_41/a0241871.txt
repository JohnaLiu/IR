Subsurface Counter Currents (SSCs) are narrow currents that
              flow eastward along the poleward edges of equatorial thermocline waters in the
              Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Recent theoretical studies have suggested several
              different mechanisms to describe their dynamics. The project will use numerical
              investigations to explore these different hypotheses and to explore how
              sensitive the currents are to mixing parameterizations within general
              circulation models of the ocean.  SSCs are major components of the tropical
              ocean circulation and may form a branch of the meridional overturning
              circulation. Therefore, an understanding of their dynamics and their
              variability will aid our understanding of climate variability. An exploration
              of how best to simulate them in ocean circulation models will aid in climate
              prediction.
