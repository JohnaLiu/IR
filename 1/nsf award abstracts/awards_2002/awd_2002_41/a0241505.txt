The Guiana Abyssal Gyre Experiment (GAGE) placed  a moored
              array of current  meters  across  the  Guiana  Basin,  to  measure  the  deep 
              boundary  current  and  to  attempt  to  detect  and quantify the hypothesized
              northward flow to its east.  As implemented the array was placed at 16 N for 27
               months,  and  GAGE  was  enhanced  through  collaboration  with  a  German 
              .Meridional  Overturning Variability  Experiment.  (MOVE,  based  at  U. 
              Kiel).    Together  the  GAGE/MOVE  program  fielded  10 moorings  with  72 
              current  meters  (measuring  temperatures  and  currents)  and  48  moored
              temperature/salinity instruments (CTDs).  Considerable shipboard CTD
              measurements were made in the Guiana Basin  in  concert  with  mooring
              deployments  and recoveries.  GAGE completed  its  fieldwork  in May 2002, with
              the exception of one GAGE mooring that failed to release and will be recovered
              in March of 2003.    A  first  look  at  the  results  from  the  moored 
              instruments, confirms the Gambia Abyssal Gyre hypothesis.  The deep western
              boundary current at 16 N is strong, estimated as 38 Sverdrups.  It has an
              unexpected  two-regime  structure  in  hydrography  and  in  measured 
              currents:    an  onshore  regime  with strong  southward  flow  near  1600  m, 
              declining  with  depth  to  weak  flow  near  4000 m,  and  an  offshore regime
               with  strong  flow  near  3600-4600  m,  declining  in  strength  upwards  and
               reversing  to  northward flow  at  1600  m.    The  hypothesized  northward 
              recirculation  is  found  in  three  regimes.    Immediately offshore and
              adjacent to the deep western boundary current the entire water column between
              1600 m and 5400 m flows northward.  On the opposite side of the Guiana Basin
              adjacent to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge northward flow extends from the seafloor at
              5400 m to 3600 m.  All array instruments across the Basin at or  below  3600 
              m,  except  one  in  the  deep  boundary  current,  exhibit  northward  flow.  
               This  yields  a surprisingly strong flow of what is called Antarctic Bottom
              Water, the coldest abyssal water.  Together these northward flow elements are
              preliminarily estimated as 19-23 Sverdrups, yielding a net transport of 15-19
              Sverdrups, the expected amplitude for the cold limb of the overturning
              circulation.   The large GAGE/MOVE datasets will be worked up in collaboration
              with the MOVE scientists.  The measured currents and the measured hydrography
              will be combined to produce a complete quantitative characterization of deep
              flow at 16 N, including its variabilities in amplitude and structure.  With
              that as a powerful constraint, the full hydrographic dataset within the Guiana
              Basin will be reexamined to fully characterize the Guiana Abyssal Gyre and
              establish its role in the cold limb of the meridional overturning
              circulation.
