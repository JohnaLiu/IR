Abstract    :
              This  exploratory research will focus on a set of experiments using the
              atmospheric component of the NCAR CCSM to test the behavior of the model using
              different parameterizations of  deep convection. Annual integrations of the
              standard version of CCSM will be carried out, each run using one of the
              convective schemes: Zhang-McFarlane, Zhang-McFarlane + (includes physical
              triggers and closure modifications for convection), Arakawa-Schubert, Relaxed
              Arakawa-Schubert, and  Prognostic Arakawa-Schubert.

The work is important
              because it should provide a strong diagnostics underpinning to the CCSM project
              from a university based group engaged in dynamical diagnosis of observed
              climate variability. The results from this project will be useful in
              identifying  the convection scheme that will be incorporated in the next
              version of the model, scheduled for early 2001.
