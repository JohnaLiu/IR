Abstract    :
              This dissertation project will offer a new non-Western perspective that will
              contribute appreciably to greater international and social understanding about
              transfer of engineering knowledge from war to peace. Specifically, it focuses
              on the transformation of aeronautical technology in Japan from the 1920s
              through 1960s and for its completion requires data collection and analysis in
              Tokyo, Kanagawa and Aichi prefectures in Japan for five months. By linking
              Japan's rapid postwar economic growth during the 1960s to development of
              wartime technology and engineering culture, this project argues that the
              wartime engineers rather than civilian engineers shaped postwar, peace-oriented
              technological development in Japan, as represented in high-speed ground
              transportation like the bullet train.  It will examine the institutional
              cultures and individual engineers that encouraged the civilian application of
              military aeronautical technology in trans-World War II Japan, which is an
              intricately tangled history of war and peace in the social history of
              technology. The intellectual and social merits of this project are twofold. 
              First, this case study of Japanese aeronautics will expand the range of
              national comparison in the field, which has exclusively drawn from Western
              experiences, to a non-Western society that has made a successful contribution. 
              It will redress the imbalance in an area of scholarship where non-Western
              societies, such as Japan, are underrepresented.  Secondly, it will suggest an
              alternative configuration of social networks between research and educational
              institutions for successful technological development.
