Abstract    :
              The vast library of underway geophysical data stored at the National Geophysical
              Data Center represents the collective investment by taxpayers and scientists
              measured in decades and billions of dollars.  It is vital that such data not
              only be archived but be subject to rigorous quality assessment and corrections.
               The PI will develop the necessary tools and procedures for both along-track
              and across-track analysis of crossover errors.  The PI will collaborate with
              the Data Center and its users to ensure the procedures are broadly implemented.
               A global database of gravity, magnetics and bathymetry crossover errors will
              be assembled and web-based access to the database will be provided.
