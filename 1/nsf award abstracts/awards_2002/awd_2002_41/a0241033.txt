This is a renewal grant based on the
              Principal Investigator's previous findings which  focused on Late Cretaceous
              volcanic and sedimentary rocks, preserved in several basins on north Ellesmere
              Island that are spatially associated with the Strand Fiord Large Igneous
              Province (LIP).    Preliminary data demonstrate that the basalts were emplaced
              during reversed polarity chron 33R or younger, less than 83 million years ago.
              Hence, these rocks provide an ideal opportunity to further examine the
              evolution of the geomagnetic field (through comparisons of high latitude
              records from lavas erupted during and younger than the Cretaceous Normal
              Polarity Superchron), and to understand the geodynamic significance of the
              Strand Fiord LIP (especially with respect to plume and nonplume models of
              formation). The shallow marine to terrestrial sediments associated with these
              rocks is also ideal for preserving climatically sensitive
fossils, which they
              hope to continue to investigate. The proposed work will support a PhD student
              and undergraduate students.  Four to six undergraduates per field season
              typically take part in the field work. Many of these students will  continue
              analyses of samples in the laboratory as part of independent study projects and
              as part of undergraduate senior theses.
