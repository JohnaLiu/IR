How do communities assemble?  The influence of local
              conditions and regional processes on community composition.

Do similar
              communities develop at similar sites?  If local conditions, such as the primary
              productivity or disturbance rate, are of primary importance in community
              assembly, then we expect that community composition at sites with similar local
              conditions would converge towards the single community state favored in that
              environment.  Alternatively, if regional processes, such as the rate at which
              species colonize a locality within a meta-community, and the order in which
              they do so, more strongly drive community assembly, then we might expect that
              communities developing at similar sites would diverge towards one of multiple
              community states.  In this project, the PI will  perform a long term experiment
              designed to discern between the influences of local conditions and regional
              processes on meta-community assembly.  This research will provide some of the
              most comprehensive evidence to date examining the relative roles of local and
              regional scale processes in determining community structure in different
              environments.  Further, the basic understanding of community assembly that is
              the focus of this project will directly relate to the conceptual foundation for
              the restoration of degraded ecosystems.
