Abstract    :
              
    Everybody thinks probabilistically, whether knowingly or not. Inability to
              reason well probabilistically makes one prone to a variety of irrational fears
              and vulnerable to scams designed to exploit probabilistic naivete, precludes
              intelligent assessment of risks, ensures the operation of several common
              biases, impairs decision making under uncertainty, facilitates the
              misinterpretation of statistical information, precludes critical evaluation of
              likelihood claims, and generally undercuts rational thinking in numerous ways.
              

    A large literature appears to support the view that people's intuitions
              about matters of probability are largely wrong. This view may be correct, but
              many of the results that have been interpreted as supportive of it can be
              challenged on methodological grounds. In particular, instructions to
              participants in studies of probabilistic reasoning have often been ambiguous or
              incompletely stated.

    In this study, we plan to manipulate the degree of
              ambiguity and incompleteness of problem statements in a controlled fashion with
              the objective of determining the extent to which previous results suggesting
              incorrect intuitions about probability will be obtained with problem statements
              that are unambiguous and complete.
