Abstract    :
              The basic aims of this research project are to construct a data set for pooled
              cross section and time series analysis of social policy in 9 countries in Latin
              America, Iberia, the Caribbean, and the Antipodes from 1950-2000, to collect
              information for a comparative historical analysis of the origins and
              transformations of social policy, and to bring quantitative and qualitative
              methodologies to systematically analyze options for and constraints on social
              policy relating to economic liberalization and transitions from authoritarian
              to democratic political systems. The ultimate goal is to identify the economic
              and political constraints posed by these processes of transformation and the
              conditions that allow for building or maintaining strong social safety nets and
              effective social services. The project will establish causal links between the
              level of economic development, consolidation of democratic institutions, and
              the nature and actions of social and political actors. It will answer the
              question of where and why options for building or preserving effective social
              safety nets and social services existed, and where and why governments pursued
              these options or failed to do so. The project will have several broader
              impacts:  Through conference presentations, scholarly articles, and a book, the
              project will contribute to a better understanding by policy makers in
              governments and in international development institutions of the ways in which
              open markets, political power distributions, and political institutions shape
              options for creative policy design and political coalition building in support
              of effective social policies. The project will also contribute to education and
              training of graduate students by involving them as research assistants and
              co-authors. Finally, the data set will be made publicly available and will
              facilitate research on a number of questions in comparative political economy
              and social policy.
