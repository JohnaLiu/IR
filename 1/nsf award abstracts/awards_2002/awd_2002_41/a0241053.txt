Abstract    :
              Under this award, the PIs propose to analyze approximately 50 abyssal
              peridotites for Nd-isotopes to determine whether variations in Nd-isotopic
              composition in ridge basalts are also observed in the associated peridotites.
              Abyssal peridotites are thought to be the residues of melting that lead to
              mid-ocean ridge basalts, however in a study on two segments of the South West
              Indian Ridge (SWIR) the PIs showed that the 143Nd/144Nd of abyssal peridotites
              are more radiogenic than MORB and do not span the range as the basalts. This
              surprising result may indicate that the peridotite is not the sole source of
              the basalts, and most likely, a lithology with a lower melting temperature than
              peridotite (like pyroxenite) is present in the MORB source. The purpose of this
              study is to confirm and extend these observations. Samples of Normal MORB will
              come from the Kane and Gibbs fracture zone, Garrett FZ, Hess Deep and the
              orthogonal spreading segment between 17 degrees and 30 degrees E along the
              SWIR. In addition samples will be studied from areas that are clearly
              influenced by hot spots: the Oceanographer fracture zone (Azores plume) the
              area of the Indian Ocean between 33 degrees - 45 degrees E (Marion hot spot).
