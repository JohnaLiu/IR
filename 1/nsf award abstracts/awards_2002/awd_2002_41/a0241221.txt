Abstract    :
              In summer 2002, the  National Science Foundation awarded 60 planning grants
              through the Bridges for Engineering Education (Bridges) Program and the
              Planning Grants for Department-Level Reform of Undergraduate Engineering
              Education (Reform) Program in the summer of 2003.  This award  will study the
              progress of these grantees as they implement their planning projects with the
              purpose of identifying, understanding, and disseminating effective practices,
              and potentially, several models of good practice.  

These research
              objectives will be achieved through the conduct of a mixed-method, longitudinal
              study of the grantees' planning processes that will include 1) tracking and
              analysis of the processes planned and implemented by grantees during their
              grant period; 2) in depth case studies of a subset of six projects (three from
              each grant program); 3) the identification of models of "best practices"
              developed by synthesizing findings among all participants and between the two
              parts of the study; and 4) development of a grounded theory of
              interdisciplinary collaborations based on the findings.
