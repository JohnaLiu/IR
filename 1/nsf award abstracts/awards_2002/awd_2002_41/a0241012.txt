Abstract    :
              Professors William E. Moerner and Martin M. Fejer of Stanford University are
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry and Atomic and Molecular
              Optics Programs to detect individual molecules using optical absorption and a
              Sagnac interferometer.  The idea of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research
              is to avoid the dependence on fluorescence, which is the basis of most single
              molecule spectroscopy at present.  Absorption would be a much more global
              approach, but is usually not as sensitive due to high background noise.  Sagnac
              interferometry directly measures the difference in optical phase shift
              experienced by beams traveling clockwise versus counterclockwise in a ring.  It
              is insensitive to excess phase amplitude and phase noise from the probing
              laser.  Saturation modulation of the molecular absorption with a secondary
              pulsed laser will be used to make the molecular absorption time varying.  By
              scanning the detection volume of the probe laser over the sample, microscopic
              images of ultrasmall features can be generated.  

The project has the
              potential to impact several fields including trace detection, biophysics,
              materials science, quantum information and nanoscience.  In biological cells,
              for example, it would be possible to perform single molecule spectroscopy
              without dye labels, which potentially perturb the system, and without
              interference from spurious emitters.
