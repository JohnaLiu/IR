This award supports the participation of American scientists
              in a U.S.-Japan joint seminar on quantum correlation and coherence to be held
              in Hokkaido, Japan from September 12-18, 2003.  The co-organizers are Professor
              John Doyle at Harvard University in Massachusetts and Professor Makoto Gonokami
              at Tokyo University in Japan.  The meeting will bring together research
              scientists from the U.S. and Japan, two countries where important and exciting
              progress in the fields of quantum optics and atomic physics continues to
              strengthen our ability to observe and manipulate coherent quantum systems. 
              Even though quantum mechanics is more than a century old, scientists are only
              just beginning to explore the fundamentals of quantum coherence.  In addition
              to amplifying our understanding of fundamental issues of quantum coherence,
              these advances are opening exciting applications in the areas of atom optics
              and interferometry, precision measurements, non-linear optics, quantum
              measurement and quantum computing.

The co-organizers have complementary
              scientific expertise in the field.  This enables them to evaluate and attract
              the best physical scientists to participate.  The seminar organizers have made
              a special effort to involve postdocs and graduate students as both participants
              and observers.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in the
              field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the
              stage for future collaborative projects.  Following the seminar the organizers
              plan to establish a workshop web page.  Conference proceedings will be
              published on this web site.
