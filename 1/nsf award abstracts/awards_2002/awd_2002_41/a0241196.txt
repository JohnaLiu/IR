Abstract    :
              Geosat radar altimetry data have made a significant contribution to mapping of
              seafloor topography.  This grant provides partial funding for a workshop that
              will review (1) the need for improved ocean bathymetry and gravity, (2) the
              fundamental physical limitations for recovering seafloor topography from
              measurements of the ocean surface slope, and (3) the mission requirements to
              achieve significant improvements in accuracy and spatial resolution.
