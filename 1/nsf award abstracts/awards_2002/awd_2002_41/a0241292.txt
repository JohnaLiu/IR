Abstract    :
              The structure of the cross-shelf flow has been of interest to coastal
              oceanographers for decades because it determines the depth at which upwelled
              water originates. This project will test a new idea that differences in
              stratification determine whether the upwelled water comes from bottom boundary
              layers (under weak stratification) or from interior depths (under strong
              stratification). Analysis of existing datasets and numerical models will be
              used to test and further develop this idea. This project has important
              implications to other coastal oceanographers interested in the transport of
              nutrients, larvae or geochemical materials.
