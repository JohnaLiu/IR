This award funds a three-year Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site at the Colorado State University (CSU) that will
              provide students with a research experience in the area of vibration and sound.
              Activities will involve fundamental research in three focus areas - modeling,
              measurements, and visualization. The REU site is designed as a year-round
              program with 5-7 students participating during the academic year and 8-10
              students participating during the summer. During the school year, many of the
              students will be students from the home institution, Colorado State University,
              with a focus on using recruitment resources within CSU such as the Women and
              Minorities in Engineering Program and the Colorado Alliance for Minority
              Participation. For the summer research experience, students will be recruited
              from across the U.S. with special attention given to recruit students attending
              schools where summer research opportunities do not exist. Regionally, special
              efforts will be made to attract students from Fort Lewis College, the
              University of Southern Colorado in Pueblo, and several community colleges.
              Students will interact with researchers and scientists at the Dynamic
              Measurements Laboratory at NIST-Boulder; the Acoustic Testing Laboratory at
              Johns -Manville in Littleton, Colorado; and Engineering Data Management of Fort
              Collins, Colorado. This REU Site is supported by the Department of Defense in
              partnership with the NSF REU Program.
