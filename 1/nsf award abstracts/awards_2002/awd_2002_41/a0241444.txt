Abstract    :
              This project will study the hydrodynamic response of subduction zones to seismic
              events by using an analytical model of coseismic pore pressure generation and a
              numerical model of  fluid flow following an earthquake. The results will help
              make better use of pore pressures as strain indicators.  As observatories that
              monitor pore pressure are established in subduction zones, it will be necessary
              to understand how pressure changes will vary with deformation style and
              magnitude, how flow systems will respond to seismic events, and how thermal or
              geochemical anomalies may be generated by coseismic deformation. The results
              will also help determine what drilling and monitoring strategies will yield the
              greatest information concerning deformation and fluid flow in subduction
              complexes.
