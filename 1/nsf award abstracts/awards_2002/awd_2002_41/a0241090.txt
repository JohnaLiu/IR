Abstract    :
              Mathematics conferences for undergraduates have been around for many years, but
              there are too few for the number of students who could benefit from them. 
              Faculty members at colleges and universities have expressed interest in hosting
              undergraduate mathematics conferences, but the daunting tasks of obtaining
              funding, and organizing and advertising such conferences keeps most people from
              acting on their interest.  This grant provides start-up funding for individuals
              who need support for an undergraduate mathematics conference through a simple
              application form to the MAA.  The grant covering these awards run through the
              academic year 2005-2006, after which time it is assumed that funding from
              alternative sources will be found to continue the conferences. 

The requests
              for funding will be reviewed at the annual winter and summer meetings of the
              MAA. It is anticipated that most awards will be between $1,000 and $4,000, but
              awards up to $8,000 might be considered in exceptional cases. These awards will
              cover the typical expenses involved with hosting any conference. These include
              travel and honorarium for invited speakers, lunch and refreshments for
              participants, and duplicating and postage for advertising.  The awards might
              also cover expenses that are often part of an undergraduate conference such as
              travel reimbursement for participants. Indirect costs to institutions hosting
              the conferences will not be allowed.
