Abstract    :
              This project is an innovative step toward a better understanding of sea-air
              interaction, in particular gas fluxes between the ocean and atmosphere.  The
              investigators will initially modify in the laboratory a newly developed
              Atmospheric Pressure Ionization Mass Spectrometer (APIMS) for shipboard
              applications.  After testing, the investigators will collaborate with a number
              of other groups on ocean research cruises and use the APIMS system to measure
              directly the sea-to-air flux of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), an important biogenic
              trace gas and natural secondary aerosol precursor.  The broader impacts of this
              research include developing a very powerful tool potentially of great
              importance to the atmospheric community.  The project results will provide
              important new data on DMS fluxes useful for improving parameterizations of the
              sea-air exchange process in global models, and provide a technical framework by
              which other trace gases relevant to climate might be investigated in future
              studies.  Graduate students will also receive laboratory training and research
              experience at sea under the project.
