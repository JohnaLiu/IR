Recent work in
              multiple antenna communications (MIMO systems) has cleverly exploited rich
              scattering in the environment to build wireless links with multiple antennas
              that offer huge capacity gains.  Systems studied so far are narrowband systems.
              Use of very wideband signals offers new ways to exploit rich scattering.  Also,
              sensor systems that exploit rich scattering have attracted little attention.
              

The proposed research will explore multiple antenna signal processing
              applications for wireless communications and sensor systems that use wideband
              signaling in a rich scattering channel. Multiple antennas, wideband
              transmission and rich scattering, each provide a number of leverages, which
              must be carefully exploited. 

While multiple antenna systems and rich
              scattering provide increased capacity, diversity and sensitivity, wideband
              transmission offers increased diversity, and, in the case of sensors, better
              resolution. The proposed research will study: 
 
1.  Signal processing in
              wireless communications and sensor systems. 
2.  Fundamental performance
              limits (ergodic/outage capacity, etc), space-time coding and receiver design
              for multiple antenna communication systems with wideband signaling in rich
              scattering environments. 
3.  Fundamental limits to resolution in sensor
              systems exploiting rich scattering and wideband signaling
