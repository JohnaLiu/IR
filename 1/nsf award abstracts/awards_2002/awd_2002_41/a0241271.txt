Abstract    :
              

This symposium on contemporary approaches to endocrine signaling is part of
              the annual meeting for the Society for Integrative & Comparative Biology
              (SICB).  It addresses technical innovations that are now being applied to
              unconventional model organisms.  Participants in this program possess expertise
              in neuroendocrinolgy, endocrinology, animal behavior, and developmental
              biology. The symposium will engage both senior and junior ranked scientists and
              students in discussions of the application of these new techniques that have
              been derived from more traditional model organisms, such as laboratory rodents.
              Introduction of new people to the society is enhanced by the international
              nature of this meeting being held in Toronto, Canada. Travel funds will allow
              participants to attend the meeting.
	The impact of this will extend to
              numerous fields of study, as mentioned above. In addition, the meeting will
              foster scientific education by training graduate and undergraduate students to
              participate in comparative biological research armed with a clear understanding
              of this sophisticated technology. A further impact will be made when these
              discussions are published in the journals:  Integrative & Comparative Biology
              and General & Comparative Endocrinology.
