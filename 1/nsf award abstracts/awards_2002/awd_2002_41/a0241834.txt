The PIs propose to develop a profiling
              instrument for the study of air-sea gas exchange. The Air-Sea Interaction
              Profiler (ASIP) will be equipped with sensors to measure temperature,
              conductivity, turbulent velocity, oxygen, and the abundance of biological
              species. Measurements will be confined to the upper 10 m of the ocean, with a
              focus on surface layers. ASIP will be completely self-contained and will be
              capable of making upwardly-rising, autonomous profiles during deployment. The
              objectives of this work focus on the close interplay between physical, chemical
              and biological processes at the ocean surface. This instrument will
              significantly enhance the scientific understanding of air-sea gas exchange,
              which has far-reaching societal ramifications due to factors such as the
              buildup of greenhouse gases and their affect on future climate. If successful,
              the data collected using this instrument will help elucidate the role of the
              ocean in absorbing CO2. Accurate knowledge of gas exchange is also important
              for monitoring ecosystems such as those in coastal regions, rivers, lakes and
              estuaries, as these data are required for determining ecosystem parameters such
              as net ecosystem production and gross primary production.
