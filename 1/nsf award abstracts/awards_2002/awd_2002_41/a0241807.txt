Abstract    :
              The effort will develop ICP-MS  analytical methods needed to analyze lithium
              isotopes in small samples (~2mg) of planktic foraminifers.  If the technique,
              which utilizes a quadrupole ICP-MS, is successful the study will analyze core
              top samples to determine if current seawater Li-isotope signal is accurately
              recorded and retained in chemically cleaned planktic foraminifer shells.  In
              addition the study will analyze separate species of planktic foraminifers in
              core top samples to test for isotopic fractionation among different species as
              a function of biologic or calcification depth.
