Abstract    :
              This is a project to conduct geophysical surveys and acquire sediment cores from
              the fjords and continental shelf of southeastern Alaska. The data collected
              will be used to examine climatic variability in this region over the Holocene
              and Late Glacial interval. In particular, the study will determine if
              terrestrial climate changes in this region are linked to changes in regional
              ocean conditions and if decadal-scale climate changes, analogous to those in
              the historical record (referred to as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation"), are
              recorded in rapidly accumulating fjord sediments. If localities are discovered
              that yield important paleoclimatic records, these localities will be targeted
              in a drilling proposal for the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program.
