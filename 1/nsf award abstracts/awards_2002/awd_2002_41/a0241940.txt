Abstract    :
              This is a project to process and analyze data multichannel seismic data
              collected off the Newfoundland Basin as part of a collaborative project
              studying non-volcanic, conjugate margin evolution.  This work will better
              define drilling targets of ODP Leg 210, the last leg of the ODP.  The
              additional work includes: 1) detailed characterization of enigmatic crust
              seaward of continental crust on the SCREECH transect; 2) pre-stack depth
              migration of SCREECH transect 2; 3) correlation of stratigraphic horizons on
              Newfoundland and Iberia using waveform inversion; 4) gravity modeling and
              calculation of mass anomalies; 5) development of a depth-domain stratigraphic
              and structural database that will be used to model Newfoundland-Iberia margin
              evolution and 6) collaboration with colleagues working on both margins to
              develop unified models of margin evolution.
