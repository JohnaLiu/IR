Abstract    :
              This is a collaborative study with German scientists from GEOMAR, as part of the
              MEGAPRINT expedition that took place aboard the R/V Sonne during 2001. The
              field program sampled critical, unmapped sections of the eastern Galapagos
              Spreading Center (GSC) and portions of young seafloor between the archipelago
              and the spreading center. Elements of the program included multi-beam seafloor
              mapping, shipboard gravity and magnetic surveys, and sampling of lavas by
              dredging at ~15 km spacing along the eastern GSC, and at numerous off-axis
              seamounts and volcanic ridges. Guided by ~100 major element glass analyses
              already completed, the PIs propose an analytical program that will determine
              trace element contents, He, Pb, Nd, Sr and Hf isotope compositions, volatile
              (CO2 ,H2O, Cl, F and S) contents and 40Ar-39Ar radiometric ages of a
              representative suite of these submarine glasses and rocks. Geophysical data
              from German colleagues will provide additional constraints on age, structure,
              thickness and tectonics of the crust and lithosphere.
