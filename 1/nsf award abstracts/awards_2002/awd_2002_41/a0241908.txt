Abstract    :
              This project is a pilot study to test the idea that sub-Milankovitch variability
              results from non-linear response of the climate system to periodic
              Milankovitch-band forcing.  In other words the hypothesis is that non-linear
              response of the climate system transfers Milankovitch-band forcing to a
              different frequency.  The hypothesis will be tested by performing bispectral
              analyses on a record of faunal variation and a benthic carbon isotope record
              from 0 - 1 Ma obtained from ODP Site 927.
