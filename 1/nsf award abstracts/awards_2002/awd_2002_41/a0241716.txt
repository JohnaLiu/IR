Abstract    :
              Under this award, the PIs propose to continue  experimental studies at upper
              mantle conditions centered around understanding the mineralogical,
              petrological, and geochemical implications of mantle water at low bulk
              concentration. Specific goals are to determine the concentration of OH in
              olivine saturated with water and the accurate determination of the solidus of
              slightly hydrous peridotite. This work will also be extended to pyroxenes,
              garnet, and low- degree high-pressure melts, placing each phase on a common
              calibrated OH concentration scale. The PIs will test the hypothesis that in
              undersaturated experiments the mineral-melt bulk D for water does not follow
              Henry's law but decreases with water concentration. The PIs will use a newly
              developed trace element technique for studying low-degree melts to study the
              region below the dry solidus in the range 2-6 GPa. They will focus first on
              accurate determinations of the solidus as a function of water content; second
              on precise measurement of extents of melting between the "damp" solidus and the
              "dry" solidus; and third on measurements of liquid compositions in equilibrium
              with peridotite residua at high pressure, relatively low temperature, and
              slightly hydrous conditions.
