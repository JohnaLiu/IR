Abstract    :
              This is a project to collect high-resolution multichannel seismic data in the
              Sandino forearc basin offshore Nicaragua. The data will be used to determine if
              a eustatic sea level signal can be discerned near a plate boundary. The data
              will be used to test the hypothesis that tectonic effects can be identified and
              distinguished by acquiring multichannel seismic data that define unconformities
              and sequences that can be correlated with coeval sequences from other margins
              and with the deep-sea oxygen isotope record proxy for sea-level change. This
              project will tackle the important problem of separating the records of tectonic
              effects and eustasy on an active margin. If successful, it may be possible to
              extract eustatic records from other active margins, thereby improving our
              understanding of global sea level change.
