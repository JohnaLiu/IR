Abstract    :
              The recent discovery that transgenes with intrinsic direct repeats can induce
              gene silencing at a very high frequency (80-100%) has significance for
              dissecting the gene silencing mechanism and for efficient generation of
              silenced mutants useful for research and agricultural biotechnology products.
              The goal of this research is to conduct detailed genetic and molecular analyses
              of the mechanism of direct repeat-induced gene silencing (DRIGS) and to use
              this phenomenon in functional genomics approaches. Experiments in this project
              will determine minimal length of repeats needed to activate gene silencing, use
              silencing suppressors and mutagenesis to identify mutants with impaired
              silencing, and develop universal cassettes utilizing DRIGS for gene-knock out/
              gene inactivation for functional analysis of plant genes. Successful completion
              of this project will achieve efficient and consistent gene inactivation; allow
              expeditious gene function analysis, and develop novel strategies for plant
              genetic engineering. The DRIGS would be invaluable for analyzing genes in the
              post gene sequencing era. In addition, research described in this project will
              advance plant biotechnology and may promote general understanding and awareness
              of biotechnology. The project will also entail training undergraduate students,
              career advancement and training of postdoctoral scientists and exposure of
              minority students to plant biotechnology research.
