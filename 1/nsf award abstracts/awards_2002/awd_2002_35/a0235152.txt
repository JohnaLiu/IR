Abstract    :
              The genomes of all organisms contain DNA sequences called promoters that control
              gene expression. The goal of this project is to understand how these regulatory
              sequences vary genetically within populations. We will survey variation in
              regulatory sequences from several genes in the purple sea urchin, an animal
              model system that is particularly favorable for such analyses. We will then
              test the function of variant sequences for their ability to bind specific
              proteins that regulate gene expression. Finally, we will screen for promoter
              sequence variants that alter the timing of gene expression.  

Studies of
              human genetics have revealed extensive variation in promoter sequences and in
              their regulatory function. Our meta-analysis of this data, published earlier
              this year, was the first study to provide direct evidence that differences in
              regulatory sequences comprise a substantial fraction of the total functional
              genetic variation within a population. The current project will extend these
              studies in an organism where we can analyze an unbiased sample of genetic
              variation in regulatory sequences that has a functional impact. The results of
              these analyses will advance understanding of the population genetics of a
              portion of the genome that is functionally critical but understudied.
