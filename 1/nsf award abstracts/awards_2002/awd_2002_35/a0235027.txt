Abstract    :
              The mechanisms by which plants defend themselves against herbivores and
              pathogens have been subject to extensive investigation in contemporary
              populations. In comparison, relatively little is known about the long-term
              evolutionary dynamics of plant defenses. This research will use the information
              contained in DNA sequences to investigate these long-term dynamics. DNA
              sequence diversity of defense genes in three Zea species, including the
              domesticate Z. mays ssp. mays (corn), and divergence of defense genes among
              different genera of grasses will be analyzed. These analyses will provide an
              unprecedented picture of the evolutionary history and present day diversity of
              plant defense genes.

In addition to advancing our understanding of plant
              evolution, the results from this research may be very valuable to agriculture.
              For example, the extensive sampling of defense alleles may identify genetic
              resources useful for developing sustainable means of pest control. This
              research may identify plant defenses that are evolutionarily stable and, thus,
              may provide durable resistance against parasites. Analysis of inter- and
              intra-population diversity will provide data necessary for developing efficient
              strategies for collecting genetic resources for conservation and crop
              improvement. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the
              proposed research and will have opportunities to learn molecular techniques and
              molecular-evolutionary analyses.
