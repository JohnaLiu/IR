Abstract    :
              A long standing fundamental question is how plants perceive and respond to
              changes in their environment. In addition to sensing and signaling,
              understanding of the regulatory genes is advancing rapidly. Very important has
              been the identification and characterization of many of the 1,500 of these
              genes that control plant responses to cold. Many other genes are also important
              in plant stress adaptation and they are being characterized at a rapid rate.
              Studies of the heat shock response have uncovered unexpected basic cell
              functions and united the study of protein folding with the function of several
              stress proteins. Biophysical aspects of temperature stress are now better
              understood. A number of proteins protect plants from low temperatures and
              freezing damage.  In short, the field of temperature stress in plants is very
              rich with opportunities for agriculture and forestry. Most critical at this
              time is bringing together scientists at molecular, cell, whole organism, and
              field levels. It will be a diverse gathering and include a union between
              diverse academic institutions within the USA and internationally including a
              union of academic and industry scientists. Involvement of industry is a
              founding principal of the Gordon Research Conferences. The timing of the 2003
              Gordon Conference on Temperature Stress in Plants could not be better!
