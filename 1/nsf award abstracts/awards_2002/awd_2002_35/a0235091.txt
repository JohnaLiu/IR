Abstract    :
              
In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Rowlen will conduct research on the vibrational
              spectroscopy of single molecules by Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (smSERS).
               The objective is a fundamental investigation on the relation between smSERS,
              the SERS continuum, and luminescence from noble metal nanoparticles, and to
              test the hypothesis that electron-hole pairs play a significant role in all
              three 
optical processes.  The results of this research may have applications
              as a tool in analytical chemistry.  

The PI will engage students and
              postdocs in the project.  They will thereby receive training in a forefront
              area of physical chemistry in preparation for advanced study or employment in
              industry, academia or government laboratories.
