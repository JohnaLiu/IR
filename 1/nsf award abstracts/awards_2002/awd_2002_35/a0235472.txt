Abstract    :
                 This project will combine experimental and computational approaches to
              demonstrate the role of weak selection in Drosophila genome evolution.  Both
              amino acid-altering and "silent" mutations in protein coding genes may affect
              the rate and accuracy with which proteins are synthesized.  Genome sequence and
              expression data will be employed to identify amino acids that allow efficient
              translation.  DNA sequence comparisons among close relatives of Drosophila
              melanogaster will determine whether selection for efficient synthesis acts as a
              global force in protein evolution. 
     Mutations with subtle effects on cell
              physiology may play a major role in biological adaptation.  However, because
              the fitness effects of "nearly neutral" mutations lie well outside the range
              that can be measured directly, comparative DNA sequence analyses may provide
              the only means of identifying such forces in natural populations. 
              Understanding the forces that constrain protein evolution will inform the
              design of genes for heterologous expression and DNA vaccination and will aid in
              identification of homologous proteins in humans and model genetic organisms. 
              This research will also provide opportunities for educators and high school
              students to conduct summer research projects in genome evolution.  In addition,
              a database of Drosophila DNA sequences will be made publically available.
