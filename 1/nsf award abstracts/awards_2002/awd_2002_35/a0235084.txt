Abstract    :
              This grant is to support travel by participants in a symposium entitled
              "Compensatory responses of mitochondria in stressful environments", as part of
              the Sixth International Congress of Comparative Physiology and Biochemistry
              (ICCPB) of the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS), to be held
              2-8 February 2003 at the Mt. Buller campus of LaTrobe University, Melbourne
              Australia.  Mitochondria are well known for producing the majority of cellular
              energy. This organelle has received renewed attention because of novel
              responses to environmental challenges imposed on cells and organisms within
              which it resides, and because mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly
              recognized as the basis for a large number of human metabolic diseases. 
              Cellular insults that alter mitochondrial function can result in reduced energy
              production for cellular and
organismal survival.  Recent work in this field by
              symposium participants has provided exciting new concepts on mitochondrial
              function and technological innovation.  From this symposium, a new synthesis of
              ideas will be published in a proceedings format, and new and renewed
              collaborations are expected to ensue.  This award will support both invited
              speakers and participating presenters, up to 8 people in total, 4 female and 4
              male.  The participants from several US institutions range in stage of academic
              career from full professor to graduate student.  Scientific meetings are one of
              the best avenues available to foster and promote research and technological
              exchanges, collaborations, and career enhancement opportunities.  The ICCPB, in
              its 4-year cycle, has consistently been a premier meeting for workers in the
              field, and the 6th ICCPB should continue in this tradition.
