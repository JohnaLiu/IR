Abstract    :
              The proposed work will continue a long-term project studying a number of aspects
              of reproductive life histories of long-lived birds. Nineteen years of leg
              banding and (under LTREB support) 10 years of intensive monitoring have
              produced a substantial scientific resource in terms of a database of individual
              histories of known birds, and an extensive age structure. Funding is requested
              capitalize on this resource by conducting studies of newly discovered
              connections between breeding ecology in our focal population and the Pacific
              Decadal Oscillation; an integrative and comprehensive study of the causes and
              consequences of bias hatching rates, including investigation of causation of
              unexpectedly high rates of unusual behavior; and a longitudinal study of aging
              and immune function in our population of several thousand known-age birds. The
              project has a record of demonstrated scientific productivity, conservation
              impacts, and extensive training of new scientists, and this record will be
              continued under further LTREB support.
