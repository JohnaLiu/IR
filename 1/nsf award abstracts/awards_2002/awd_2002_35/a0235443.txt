Abstract    :
              The purpose of this SGER project is to support collaborative research to be
              carried out utilizing the Clemson University relocatable optical observatory
              and the radar and optical instrumentation at Millstone Hill Observatory.  The
              Clemson optical observatory is equipped with two optical instruments: a triple
              etalon Fabry-Perot interferometer (designated as SOFDI) and an all sky imaging
              photometer. The plan is to locate the optical observatory at a location near
              Newport, Vermont for four months of remote operations from March to July of
              2003. The objectives of the proposed collaboration are listed as follows: 1) to
              obtain and compare simultaneous optical and radar measurements of meridional
              winds and temperatures during the daytime, 2) to obtain and compare
              simultaneous optical and radar observations of ion temperatures and ion drifts
              during twilight periods, 3) to carry out simultaneous bistatic observations of
              mesospheric and thermospheric winds and temperatures during the night to
              examine possible correlation between mesosphere and thermosphere gravity wave
              activity, 4) to search for possible evidence of the hot oxygen corona through
              the detection of an anomalous broadening of the 732 nm spectral profile and to
              compare these results with Millstone Hill results, 5) to search for possible
              evidence of the daytime formation of auroral discrete arcs, 6) to obtain and
              compare mesospheric wind measurements obtained with the U. of New Hampshire
              meteor wind radar with the results from the FPI measurements of mesospheric
              winds.  This collaborative series of observations would serve as an excellent
              field test of the new design represented by the SOFDI FPI instrument before the
              planned deployment of the Clemson relocatable optical observatory to the
              location of Huancayo, Peru.  Only an SGER award can support such a window of
              opportunity of fielding the SOFDI close to an ISR, namely that at Millstone
              Hill.
