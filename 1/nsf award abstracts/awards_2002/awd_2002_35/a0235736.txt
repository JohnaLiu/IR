Abstract    :
              Ecologists study ecosystems that currently appear on the planet and from this
              picture, essentially a single slice of geological time, they attempt to explain
              patterns like altitudinal and latitudinal gradients in diversity and ecosystem
              responses to climatic change.  In contrast, paleontologists work with much
              lower resolution data but provide a temporal (historical) dimension.  This
              proposal will develop and test a methodology to combine these two disciplines
              and examine the historical, macro-ecological patterns of forest community
              distribution.  The proposed work would provide an ecological classification of
              both modern and fossil forest ecosystems based on the leaf architectural
              characters of the floras.  This approach is justified by the fact that there is
              a relationship between leaf traits and ecological factors such as climate, such
              that modern forests ecosystems can be reasonably classified from leaf traits. 
              The P.I.s propose to extend this approach to fossil assemblages.  A substantial
              data set of modern and fossil leaf traits will also be created and made
              publicly available from this work.  The results would provide a quantitative
              tool through which ecologists could place their research into a much longer
              temporal context, and through which paleontologists could begin to address
              significant ecological questions with their research.
