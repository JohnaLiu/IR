What determines the number of coexisting species in a local area
              is a long-standing question for ecologists. This is particularly challenging
              for plant communities because plants require similar resources and so we would
              expect the number of coexisting species to be strongly limited by competition. 
              One important, but rarely tested, hypothesis to explain the high diversity of
              plant communities is that variation in resource levels across different patches
              (i.e., spatial resource heterogeneity) may regulate species diversity. We are
              currently testing this hypothesis in a large-scale field experiment in Michigan
              grassland by experimentally increasing soil resource levels through
              fertilization in either a homogeneous or heterogeneous fashion.  This
              manipulation is combined with a species (seed) addition treatment to test if
              the ability of species to invade these grassland communities changes under
              different nutrient regimes. In this renewal, we will continue to follow changes
              in plant species diversity in response to our treatments of nutrient patchiness
              and potential species invasion.  We also will establish a new experiment in
              which we will determine whether the presence of clonal plants - species that
              grow by producing vegetative shoots - influences the ability of non-clonal
              species to respond to heterogeneity in soil resources.
