Abstract    :
              One of the major mechanisms for coupling the ionosphere and the magnetosphere is
              through ion outflows.  On the dayside, the primary driver of the polar wind is
              photoelectrons.  This project will investigate the evolution of the polar wind,
              using a hybrid simulation code that can take into account the collisional
              effects of the photoelectrons and wave-particle interactions.  The
              self-consistent effects on the polar wind due to particle precipitation from
              the magnetosphere will also be included.  The results from the theoretical and
              modeling work will be compared with data from the Akebono and POLAR satellites.
               The results will advance our understanding of ionosphere-magnetosphere
              coupling, which has an important role in the dynamics of the magnetosphere and
              space weather.
