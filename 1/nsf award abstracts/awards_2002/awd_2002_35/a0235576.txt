Abstract    :
              This project will estimate of the long-term capacity of forest soils to
              sequester atmospheric carbon under elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). 
              Investigators from a small, undergraduate institution in Maine will conduct
              this research at The Duke Forest in North Carolina where the Duke FACE
              (Free-Air CO2 Enrichment) experiment is being conducted. This FACE experiment
              involves experimentally doubling atmospheric CO2 concentrations over large
              circular plots in a loblolly pine forest.  The forest plots have been exposed
              to elevated CO2 continuously since 1996 and treatments will continue through
              the course of the NSF-funded soil study. The researchers will investigate
              processes that control carbon storage and turnover in forest soils under
              current conditions and under global projects of doubled atmospheric CO2
              concentrations.   The results will be relevant to the issue of the long-term
              sustainability of carbon sinks in forests.  Additionally, this research will
              provide opportunities for undergraduate students in biology and chemistry at
              Bowdoin College to participate in important, interdisciplinary global change
              research, including opportunities to attend national scientific meetings.
