Abstract    :
              This project will develop and analyze models of biological invasions by
              constructing a mathematical theory describing how populations respond upon
              arrival in a new area.  That theory will provide measures of population
              performance that can complement those customarily used to measure population
              viability (e.g., rates of increase and extinction probabilities). The theory
              will incorporate both demography (i.e., the rates at which individuals move
              from one life cycle stage to another) and dispersal (i.e., the propensity to
              move and the directions and distances moved by individuals at each stage of the
              life cycle).

Invasion is an important problem. First, invasive pest species
              have enormous environmental and economic impact. The problem is not only
              agricultural; pressures from invasive species are a major impact on endangered
              endemic species around the world. Understanding the factors determining the
              success and speed of invasions can provide important guidance for management
              tactics. Second, a consequence of habitat alteration or climate change will be
              the movement of species into areas where they previously could not survive.
              This is another form of invasion, and understanding the factors controlling it
              is an important part of understanding the effects of climate change. On a
              positive note, when conservation efforts are successful, species previously
              eliminated from an area expand their ranges at speeds governed by the same
              invasion mechanisms.
