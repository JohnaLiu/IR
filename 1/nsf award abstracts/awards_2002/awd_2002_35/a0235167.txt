Abstract    :
              Prokaryotes consist of bacteria and archaea. Sulfolobus solfataricus is a member
              of the crenarchaeal subdivision of the archaea which like eukaryotes catalyze
              basal transcription using a Pol II-type RNA polymerase, TATA-box promoters and
              promoter binding proteins. Whether this evolutionary overlap includes
              regulatory (accessory) transcription components is unknown.  This project will
              focus on gene regulatory mechanisms in archaea and their relationship if any to
              eukaryotes and bacteria. The Catabolite Repression (CR) system of S.
              solfataricus will be used as a model of archaeal gene regulation. The CR system
              exerts coordinate control over the expression of glycosyl hydrolase (GH) genes.
              Altered GH expression occurs in response to changes in the type of carbon
              source (catabolite responsiveness), or by mutation at a locus called car.  car
              mutants exhibit reduced GH mRNA levels and an attenuation of catabolite
              responsiveness suggesting car mediates CR. Since GH mRNA stability is
              unaffected by CR, regulation must occur at the level of transcript synthesis.
              Widespread genomic distribution of the affected genes indicates their
              coordinate expression employs a trans-acting factor possibly encoded or
              regulated by car.  New directed recombination (gene replacement) methods reveal
              CR exhibits two characteristics of gene silencing, positional repression and
              action-at-a-distance. Relocation of an affected GH gene to a different
              chromosomal locus disrupts catabolite responsiveness, while a car-insensitive
              promoter inserted at a car-regulated locus becomes sensitive (repressed) by
              car. The main hypothesis of this project is that CR in S. solfataricus employs
              an ancestral version of eukaryotic transcriptional silencing to control gene
              expression. This hypothesis will be tested using gene replacement and in vitro
              transcription methods to identify and characterize sequences used by the CR
              regulatory mechanism. The project will broaden inclusion of under represented
              groups and broaden dissemination to enhance scientific and technological
              understanding by expanding use of a web-based internet site on
              hyperthermophilic archaea. The anticipated project results will provide insight
              into basic aspects of archaeal metabolism and the evolutionary origin of gene
              expression.
