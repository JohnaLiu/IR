Abstract    :
              Geminiviruses replicate their small DNA genomes in mature plant cells using host
              DNA replication enzymes. Infected cells also replicate host chromosomal DNA but
              do not undergo cell division. The uncoupling of DNA replication and cell
              division - or endoreduplication - is a common developmental event in plants and
              animals. The overall goal is to characterize a novel protein kinase that occurs
              in endoreduplicating leaf cells and is induced by geminivirus infection. The
              first aim is compare the properties of the kinase and second, closely related
              protein to determine if one or both of them play a role in endoreduplication
              and infection. The second aim is to determine the impact of altering kinase
              expression on leaf development and viral infection. The third aim will identify
              proteins that interact with the kinase and may be phosphorylation targets. The
              research will increase understanding of the mechanisms that control plant
              development and disease as well provide insight into basic eukayotic processes.
              The research may lead to new strategies for altering plant growth, resulting
              higher yields and shorter growing seasons, and new methods for controlling
              geminivirus disease. The research will provide training in state-of-the-art
              molecular, cellular and genomic technologies for scientists at all levels of
              their education.
