Abstract    :
              Most night-flying moth locate mates through female production of, and male
              response to very precise blends of three or more species specific airborne
              chemicals. Within a species, females that produce atypical blends are not as
              attractive as other females. Similarly, rare males that have genes for response
              to an altered blend are expected to be less reproductively fit than normal
              males. Based on our current understanding of the genetics and mechanics of
              sexual communication in moths, evolution is expected to select against the
              proliferation of new sexual communication systems. However, there are currently
              thousands of moth species, each with a unique system of communication. Our goal
              is to hybridize two closely related moth species that differ in their
              pheromones and male responses. We will map sexual communication genes and
              develop strains with single genetic differences in pheromone production or
              response to determine if and to what extent their fitness is decreased in a
              number of environmental conditions.

There are many complex traits for which
              diversification is expected to be hindered in early evolutionary stages. We
              expect the information from our work on moths to provide general insight into
              how traits that are expected to be conserved, can diversify.
