Abstract    :
              David Micha is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program
              to develop a theory of the quantum dynamics of the many-atom systems by
              combining density matrix and time-dependent many-electron treatments.  Research
              outcomes will provide atomic models, and generate electronic potential
              energies, couplings, and electric transition dipoles as needed for molecular
              spectra and dynamics.  A related research objective is to describe the
              femtosecond dynamics and spectra of electronic rearrangement induced by
              collisions or by light absorption, particularly for systems with an alkali atom
              and either a few or many noble gas atoms.  This effort involves atomic orbital
              changes, multiplet and fine structure of atomic transitions, and similar
              transitions for molecular electronic states.  

The knowledge and computer
              software developed in this project will be applicable to phenomena in
              photochemistry and photobiology that are relevant to societal concerns about
              the environment and medicine, as well as energy production using solar
              radiation.  Minority graduate education will be actively advanced in this
              project.  Micha will also continue to coorganize Pan American workshops that
              involve a significant fraction of Hispanic participants.
