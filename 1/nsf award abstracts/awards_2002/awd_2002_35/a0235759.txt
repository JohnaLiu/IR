Abstract    :
              The Gordon Research Conferences provide an international forum for the
              presentation and discussion of frontier research in the biological, chemical
              and physical sciences, and their related technologies.  The GRC on Polymer
              Colloids to be held in Tilton Scholl, Tilton, NH, from June 29 to July 4 2003,
              will cover a wide range of scientific disciplines and technologies involving
              the ever-increasingly important field of polymer colloids.  Colloid, interface
              and polymer sciences are the three most important scientific disciplines in
              this area.  The 2003 GRC will also cover new applications of polymer colloids
              in bio- and nano-materials, in which they play an important role.  Well-known
              world leaders in the field accept invitations to deliver talks and to be
              discussion facilitators.  The conference will have 21 invited oral
              presentations and a session of about 60 poster presentations.

This
              conference will have broad international representation and is expected to
              advance interdisciplinary research and education in the field of polymer
              colloids.
