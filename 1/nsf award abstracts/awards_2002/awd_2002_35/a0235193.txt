Abstract    :
              This project proposes to extend the EPICS Engineering Projects in Community
              Service model by vertically integrating select University of Illinois
              undergraduate EPICS teams with K-12 students in the Champaign-Urbana. 
              Depending on the nature of the project, the K-12 students will work as
              consultants for, clients of, or teammates with undergraduate students on real
              science and engineering projects that serve the community.  Problem-based
              learning and cooperative learning will be the key pedagogical approaches to
              enhancing student learning.  By presenting K-12 students with an open-ended
              problem and challenging them to work together to find and implement a solution,
              the students will development cognitively as they learn new information,
              analyze data and alternatives, synthesize and create solutions, and evaluate
              alternative.  Further, engaging K-12 students in large, real-world
              "hands-on/minds-on" problems in teams with undergraduate engineering students
              will increase the motivation, confidence, excitement and interest of younger
              students in SMET.
