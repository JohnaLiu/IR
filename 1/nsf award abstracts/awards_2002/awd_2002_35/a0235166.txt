Abstract    :
              This Symposium on Comparative & Integrative Vision Research is part of the
              annual meeting of the Society for Integrative & Comparative Biology (SICB). It
              addresses recent advances in vision, with a plan that integrates
              multidisciplinary work including development, molecular biology, optics and
              sensory ecology, and evolution. The meeting emphasizes interdisciplinary
              interactions among newer and more established investigators. Introduction of
              new people to the society is enhanced by the international aspect of the
              meeting in Toronto, Canada. Funding assists with travel awards for participants
              to attend the meeting. 
    The impact extends beyond sensory neuroscience to
              the fields of sensory ecology and evolutionary biology, by discussions at the
              meeting and publication in the journal Integrative & Comparative Biology. There
              is a further impact on scientific education and training by the emphasis on
              graduate and undergraduate participation.
