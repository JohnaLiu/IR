Abstract    :
              This project would research the efficacy of one particular technique in the
              restoration of native perennial California grasslands. Invasions by exotic
              species are among the most serious threats to global biodiversity and
              restoration is a critical tool to mitigate losses.  In California, 9.2 million
              ha of native perennial grassland has been invaded by exotic annual plants from
              the Mediterranean region with a concomitant loss of native plant biodiversity,
              and altered biogeochemical processes including increased nitrate leaching,
              altered fire regimes, and decreased carbon storage.

This research will
              utilize experiments that focus on the underlying ecological processes,
              particularly seed limitation and altered ecosystem processes, that may have
              facilitated and maintained the conversion of native habitat.  The generality of
              the results will be determined by conducting experiments across a broad range
              of latitudes and habitats within California.  The results may have broad
              application to many other settings where similar alteration of native habitats
              have occurred, providing an important tool to promote restoration efforts. 
              Furthermore, the research sites employ up to 15 undergraduates students a year,
              and are visited by hundreds of school children and adults, providing an
              opportunity to educate people about important ecological changes and how to
              ameliorate them.
