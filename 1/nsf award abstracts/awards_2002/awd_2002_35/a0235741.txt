The vagus nerve plays a major role in the
              regulation of gastrointestinal motility and secretion as well as pancreatic
              secretory functions such as insulin and proteins. Previous studies suggest
              that, apart from nutritional factors, the control of insulin and protein
              secretion might be controlled by different neuronal factors.  Recent studies
              have reported diverse morphological and electrophysiological features of the
              brainstem neurons that originate the vagus nerve. These features appear to be
              associated with specific gastrointestinal functions. Preliminary data suggest
              that also brainstem neurons projecting to the pancreas might comprise
              populations that can be distinguished by their pharmacological features. In
              addition, electrophysiological and morphological differences also exist within
              those neurons projecting to the pancreas. Until now, these pharmacological,
              morphological and electrophysiological features have not been correlated with
              specific pancreatic functions.  In order to provide a more thorough
              understanding of the role of this nucleus in the control and regulation of
              pancreatic function, the pharmacological properties of DMV neurons with their
              morphological and membrane properties will be examined. 
These experiments
              will combine state-of-the-art electrophysiological recording from
              pancreas-projecting identified neurons in brainstem slices with pharmacological
              tests and morphological reconstructions.   The results of these studies will
              provide new insights into the processing of information directed at the control
              of pancreatic functions and contribute to our understanding of the
              neurophysiological substrates of the control of pancreatic function.
