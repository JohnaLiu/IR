Abstract    :
              This project provides partial funding for the 2003 Gordon Research Conference on
              RNA Editing, to be held January 19-24 at the Holiday Inn in Ventura,
              California.  This meeting has occurred in alternate years since 1997 and is the
              only existing meeting devoted exclusively to the field of RNA editing.  The
              meeting serves as the venue where researchers present important and exciting
              breakthroughs in the field, and recent meetings have featured reports ranging
              from the development of the first in vitro systems for studying RNA editing in
              plant organelles, to the first demonstration that RNA editing is crucial for
              proper neuronal function in mice, flies, and worms.  Because the meeting is the
              only regularly scheduled meeting in the field, it is the primary means by which
              young researchers are exposed to other scientists in the field.  Typically,
              about 40%of the attendees at the RNA Editing GRC are postdoctoral trainees and
              graduate students. As is typical of Gordon Research Conferences, the 2003 RNA
              Editing meeting will be conducted in a relaxed setting that fosters informal
              discussion between participants.   Speakers will be selected based on the
              significance and quality of their recent scientific contributions, as well as
              with the goal of achieving diversity among age, gender, and ethnicity.  All
              attendees will be invited to present a poster and, funds permitting, travel
              awards will be made to select graduate students and postdoctoral applicants.
