Abstract    :
              Plant species characterized by short-distance dispersal (e.g. ant-dispersed
              species) are
hypothesized to be absent from suitable habitat due to dispersal
              limitation while species characterized by long-distance dispersal (e.g.
              bird-dispersed species) are often present in unsuitable (sink) habitat due to
              frequent re-colonization and rescue. These two hypotheses are being tested in a
              study of the demography and distribution of six forest-understory herb species
              in a region extending from the lower Piedmont of Georgia to the upper
              elevations of the Blue Ridge. Among the goals of the study are 1) to develop a
              rigorous method of delineating suitable habitat by measuring the demographic
              response of each species to environmental variation, with particular emphasis
              on responses to soil moisture and light availability, and 2) to use this
              methodology to test hypotheses about how habitat suitability, demography, and
              dispersal interact to influence species distributions. In addition to
              continuing to follow the demography of approximately 15,000 marked individuals,
              the proposed research will test hypotheses specific to the biology of each of
              the six study species. The proposed research will help understand and evaluate
              the impact of climate and land-use change on biological diversity. A detailed
              knowledge of factors controlling the distribution of the study species will
              help policy analysts evaluate the potential negative impacts of global change
              and help resource managers better protect threatened species in times of global
              change. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate actively in all
              aspects of the research, gaining experience in experimental design, demographic
              studies, data management, statistical analysis, and preparation of results for
              presentations and publication.
