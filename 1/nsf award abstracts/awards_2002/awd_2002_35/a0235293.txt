Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to develop a systematic study of radical
              heterolysis reactions.  The research will include kinetic and mechanistic
              studies of radical cations, focusing on radical cations believed to be involved
              in the rearrangement of methylmalonyl/coenzyme-A to succinate in vivo. 
              Strained 3-membered ring "reporter groups" will be synthesized and opened
              photolytically to measure the rate of radical formation by UV spectroscopy. 
              This approach is well suited for the study of alpha- and beta-carboxylate
              functionalized radicals believed to be involved in the chemistry of B12
              dependent enzymes.  

With this Renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr.
              Martin E. Newcomb of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois,
              Chicago.  Professor Newcomb will focus his research on the use of lasers to
              break critical bonds related to the function of vitamin B12 in the human body. 
              This work will have impact on the design of new methods for catalysis in the
              pharmaceutical industry, as well as important impacts on the understanding of
              enzyme function.  The educational activity of the award revolves around the
              training of graduate students in the study of short-lived chemical
              intermediates.
