Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT:  Nitrogen (N) availability often limits plant growth in forestry and
              agriculture, while excess N in atmospheric deposition increasingly harms
              forests throughout the US.  Mycorrhizal fungi are key plant symbionts and
              directly influence plant growth and N cycling through the uptake, retention,
              and transfer of soil-derived N.  At present, mycorrhizal symbioses are poorly
              understood.  Consequently, they are largely absent from conceptual pictures of
              forest functioning and ecosystem models used to predict forest growth and
              stress responses.  Foliar 15N:14N ratios appear useful markers of carbon and N
              allocation in the symbiosis, but we have limited understanding of biochemical
              mechanisms regulating 15N:14N distributions. 
We will measure complete carbon
              and N isotope budgets in mycorrhizal Pinus sylvestris seedlings supplied with
              different N forms, at different N availabilities, and with different fungal
              symbionts.  Photosynthesis, belowground respiration, and aboveground
              respiration will also be quantified.  We will also investigate the underlying
              biochemical mechanisms causing 15N:14N patterns using data from mass
              spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements.  
From these
              experiments in culture, we will be poised to (1) measure carbon allocation to
              mycorrhizal fungi in ecosystems under different environmental conditions, (2)
              use foliar 15N:14N measurements to indicate allocation to mycorrhizal fungi,
              and (3) explicitly incorporate mycorrhizal fungi into ecosystem-level models. 
              
BROADER IMPACTS:  This work will improve understanding of what regulates
              forest productivity and the functioning of mycorrhizal symbioses under
              anthropogenic N deposition.  There will be at least 3 graduate students trained
              on this grant.
