The objective of this project is to develop a new kind of
              gas-phase biosensor to simultaneously detect chemical and biological warfare
              agents entirely in the gas phase and in real time.  Recent studies have
              demonstrated that biological pathogens emit volatile chemical metabolites that
              potentially can be utilized as a unique gas-phase signature.  Therefore, the
              volatile chemical agents will be detected directly while the biological
              species, such as bacteria, will be detected through their volatile metabolites.
               The PIs will develop nanoparticles possessing synthetic receptor sites
              targeted to the volatile chemical metabolites of particular biological
              pathogens.  The imprinted particles will be interfaced with a microfabricated
              transducer and the resulting biochip will be tested under exposure to a variety
              of vapors including the metabolites.  This technology has the potential to
              reduce or eliminate the costly, labor intensive and time consuming practice of
              current air sampling and analysis techniques.  If successful, a portable,
              hand-held, gas phase biosensor could be deployed at various high-risk locations
              to provide real-time monitoring for biological and chemical agents.
