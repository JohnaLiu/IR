SGER:
              Hidden Markov Models for Three-Dimensional Packing Arrangements in
              Proteins

Our goal is to design a hidden Markov model (HMM) that captures the
              sequence dependence of non-local interactions in proteins. The model will focus
              on recurrent substructures that are known to exist in proteins but whose
              sequence similarity is undetectable by current methods. These recurrent packing
              arrangements, or cores, are encoded in the spatial relationships between the
              HMM states, which represent individual residues. New algorithms will allow the
              prediction of the protein chain's self-avoiding path through the 3D states. The
              approach tests the topology-driven hypothesis for protein folding, and if
              successful it will represent an advance in our ability to predict protein
              structure from sequence.

The approach is broadly applicable to systems that
              can be described in two spaces, sequential/temporal and spatial, and for which
              (1) a large database of known examples exists, and (2) a common underlying
              principle led to all of the examples.  Applications include weather prediction,
              brain function, ecosystems and natural languages.
