Abstract    :
              This project combines hands-on experiential discovery laboratory exercises with
              computer-aided instruction into computer aided laboratory instruction (CALI).
              The goal of the project is to enhance laboratory learning and understanding
              while significantly reducing the time, equipment, staffing and space
              requirements.  A generalized, interactive software application is being
              developed which presents the laboratory problem, guides students through setup
              of the experiment and physical apparatus, monitors the experimental effort,
              provides feedback during the laboratory exercise, and evaluates student
              performance.  An existing prototype CALI experiment is being modified, based on
              experience to date, and two new experiments are being developed.   
The
              efficacy of the CALI system is being evaluated by having randomly selected
              experimental groups perform the CALI experiments and comparing their short and
              long term learning with control groups performing conventional laboratory
              experiments with similar apparatus without the CALI interface.  This evaluation
              procedure is being replicated at another institution for one of the
              experiments.   Resources are being tracked to estimate potential savings.  CALI
              details and the evaluation results will be disseminated by conference
              presentations and through testing of the system at the second
              institution.
