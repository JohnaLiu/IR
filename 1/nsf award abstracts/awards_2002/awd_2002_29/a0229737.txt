Abstract    :
              This research will examine the effects of anthropogenic activity and global
              warming on freshwater and organic carbon input to the Arctic Ocean from the
              Lena River for the last 50-150 years.  Additionally, it will reconstruct the
              late Holocene freshwater and organic carbon discharges for the past 2,000
              years.  The overarching goal will be to assess impacts of late Holocene climate
              change on watershed-river-upper ocean linkages.  The research will obtain a
              broad suite of observations, including bottom sediment and water column
              properties, from the Lena River delta and will use these to parameterize the
              historical data.  Age dating will be done using radioactive decay methods to
              produce a reliable annual to decadal age model, microfossils from sediment
              cores will be analyzed to reconstruct the Lena River's fluvial dynamics, and
              palynological studies will recover information about past environmental change
              in the Lena watershed.  Results will be correlated with tree-ring records to
              generate information on arctic/subarctic humidity and precipitation.  Globally,
              the results will contribute to understanding contributions of the Russian
              arctic rivers to global hydrologic and carbon cycles.
