This study will calibrate a thermodynamic model for sulfur
              in silicate melts as a function of temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity,
              sulfur fugacity and bulk melt composition. The resulting model will be
              applicable to a wide range of problems in igneous petrology, volcanology,
              magmatic ore genesis, planetary geology, and metallurgy. Two categories of
              experiments will be performed. The first set will study a variety of silicate
              melt compositions in a controlled sulfur atmosphere at super-liquidus
              temperatures to calibrate a thermodynamic model for sulfur. Results will be
              used to incorporate sulfur into Ghiorso and Sack's (1995) MELTS model. A second
              set of experiments will determine the partial molar volumes of sulfide liquid
              components in the system O-S-Fe-Ni-Cu. These experiments will employ a modified
              single-bob Archimedian method to measure density. Results will be used to
              calibrate a model for sulfur in silicate liquids at pressure.
