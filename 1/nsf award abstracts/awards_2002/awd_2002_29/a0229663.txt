This project will define the roles of the mantle wedge and
              subducting slab in generating volcanic arc lavas using B-Be-Li abundances and
              Li isotopes. The main scientific goal of the project is to better constrain the
              geochemical variability of sub-arc mantle regions, and the origins of that
              variation. Two different but comparable subduction systems will be studied: the
              Trans-Mexican Volcanic belt (TMVB) and the more vigorously subducting and
              B-enriched Guatemala segment of the Central American arc. These systems have
              low B/Be ratios and abundant off-axis volcanism, and offer the opportunity to
              assess the role of the mantle and constrain effects of crustal assimilation.
              

The project will be conducted in two phases: 1) an undergraduate summer
              research experience, where students from the University of South Florida and
              other participating institutions measure B-Be-Li elemental abundances in lavas
              from these suites, and 2) MS/PhD student research on the Li isotope systematics
              of lavas from the TMVB, Guatemala, and key intraplate volcanic sites. This work
              plan will train a cadre of undergraduate and graduate students in the use of
              geochemistry as a tool in the study of volcanic arcs.
