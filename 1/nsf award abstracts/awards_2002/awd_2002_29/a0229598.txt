Abstract    :
              This is the first year of funding of a 4-year continuing award. The PI will
              focus on the development of a biologically plausible framework for sensor-based
              machine olfaction (SBMO), with an emphasis on computation, analysis and
              instrumentation. The specific objectives are: (1) To develop a computational
              architecture based on neuro-morphic models of the biological olfactory system
              in order to improve the signal-processing and cognitive capabilities of SBMO;
              (2) To validate the perceptual plausibility ofthe computational architecture
              through comparative studies with the "gold standard" for olfactory perception -
              human-panel sensory analysis; (3) To develop advanced sensor interrogation
              techniques in order to improve selectivity, sensitivity and robustness of
              commercial conductivity-based gas sensor arrays. The results will lay the
              foundations fora new generation of SBMO systems by helping bridge the gap
              between multivariate chemical sensing and human olfactory perception. Improved
              analytical capabilities, as a result of advances in both signal processing and
              sensor instrumentation, will broaden the range of applications for SBM0.
