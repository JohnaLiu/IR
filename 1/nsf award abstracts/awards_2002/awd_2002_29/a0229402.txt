UNAVCO, Inc. is a non-profit, membership-governed, 501c(3)
              organization which supports and promotes Earth science by advancing
              high-precision geodetic and strain techniques such as the Global Positioning
              System (GPS) and acts as the agent through which the geodetic community
              communicates scientific consensus and cutting-edge research directions in
              geodesy to the National Science Foundation, Division of Earth Sciences. This
              grant supports UNAVCO, Inc. through FY '03 for the management of NSF-support of
              geodetic community activities including workshops and conferences and to
              promote scientific consensus on important national geoscience programs. 
              UNAVCO, Inc. will also plan, procure and manage necessary infrastructure,
              including analytical instrumentation, information systems for data capture,
              analysis, archival and distribution, and intellectual capital/human resources,
              to implement complex and large-scale national geophysics research
              programs.
