This proposal funds the Thermochemistry Facility at UC
              Davis.  This facility has unique capabilities to measure enthalpies of
              formation in mineralogical systems. This project emphasizes the thermochemistry
              of high-pressure perovskite phases relevant to the Earth's lower mantle, of
              other lower pressure hydrous phases, and of rare earth - bearing geochemical
              systems. In addition, it will provide the infrastructure support to allow
              visitors to perform calorimetric measurements relevant to a variety of
              mineralogical and geochemical problems.
