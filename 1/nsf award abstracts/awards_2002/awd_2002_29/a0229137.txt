Abstract    :
              The Global Emissions Inventory Activity  (GEIA) is a crosscutting activity of
              the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project, a core project
              of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP).   Since 1990, GEIA has
              been providing quality assured emission inventories for global studies of past,
              present and future atmospheric chemistry, air quality and climate change.  The
              GEIA Center is responsible for long-term coordination, outreach and
              planning.

In this project, GEIA will expand information to be distributed
              through the GEIA web site.  This will include quality assured references and
              links and commentaries related to: non-GEIA global data bases and key regional
              inventories, underlying data sets and algorithms used to derive emissions,
              historical and future trends of emissions, seasonality of emissions, innovative
              techniques for developing emissions data bases, etc. 

GEIA Center tasks will
              include:  (1) Coordination (Manage development, review and distribution of new
              GEIA data and information, and develop and maintain close collaboration with
              modeling groups and other customers); (2) Outreach (Expand the GEIA network,
              distribute news, and organize annual workshops, and develop informational
              materials for various audiences), and (3) Planning  (Assess critical needs and
              implementation issues and develop new strategies to address those).  Thus, GEIA
              will continue to provide valuable information for use of a large scientific
              community.
