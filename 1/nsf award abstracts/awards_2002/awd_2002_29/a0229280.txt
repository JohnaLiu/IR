Abstract    :
               Written Language Recognition has great significance not only as a convenient
              and natural way of interacting with computers but also as an important
              challenge in AI.  Its importance as an input interface to computers is
              comparable to that of speech in terms of naturalness and convenience of
              use.

Notwithstanding the strong evidence from cognitive reading theories
              that suggests that text recognition is an interactive process that makes
              efficient use of resources at every stage, traditional handwriting recognition
              systems have employed a monotonically cascaded architecture.  The primary goal
              of this proposed research is to develop a computational model of handwriting
              recognition that is grounded in cognitive reading theories.   The model will
              account for several aspects of handwriting recognition that have not been
              addressed in the literature to date.  The architecture of the word recognition
              model will allow it to actively seek information from earlier processing
              stages.   Depending on the quality of the image and the difficulty of the
              lexicon, the feature extractor will send information on only a subset of
              possible features, allowing an internal decision-maker to evaluate the
              information and request more if needed.
