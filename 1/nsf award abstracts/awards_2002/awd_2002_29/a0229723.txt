Abstract    :
              CoCoRaHS or the Community Collaborative Rain and Hail Study builds on previously
              funded NSF research on precipitation patterns in the western portion of the US.
               This award will expand the current citizen science efforts to include those
              living in the Great Plains including Eastern Colorado, Western Nebraska,
              Northwest Kansas and Southeast Wyoming.  Participants gain experience in data
              collection and analysis while working with scientists and contributing to a
              national research study.  CoCoRaHS volunteers will learn about the impact of
              regional weather patterns on agriculture, water resources and environmental
              quality while collecting rain, hail and snow data.  Participants are also
              invited to take part in other activities to build on the research experience
              including a series of seminars, field trips and workshops.  The project will
              result in the development of the following materials:  graphic depictions of
              data using ARC-GIS software, a teacher curriculum, an upgraded website and a
              quarterly newsletter.
