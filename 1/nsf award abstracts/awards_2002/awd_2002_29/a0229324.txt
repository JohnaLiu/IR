ABSTRACT

	We propose to continue our study of post-earthquake
              healing, fault zone process, and dynamic rupture of the 1999 M7.1 Hector Mine,
              California, earthquake using fault-zone trapped waves. Observations and FD
              simulations of fault-zone trapped waves generated by aftershocks and
              explosions, and recorded at linear seismic arrays deployed across the Hector
              Mine surface rupture, have revealed a ~100 m wide low-velocity waveguide along
              the rupture zone, and the bifurcation of northern rupture at the seismogenic
              depth.  Our previous work has also shown that this low-velocity waveguide has
              healed since the mainshock, with P and S wave velocities increasing by ~1%
              between 2000 and 2001. Continued monitoring of healing in the Hector Mine
              rupture zone will help us to see if its healing rate slows with time, as did
              the healing rate at Landers. In the present proposal, we shall 1) repeat the
              experiment in 2003 to find further evidence of the time- and spatial-dependence
              of fault healing; 2) develop a mechanical model based on crack dilatancy theory
              combined with chemical sealing for interpretation of fault healing; 3) simulate
              dynamic rupture on multiple fault segments and relate these models to the
              extent of damage to the rock mass in fault zone; 4) analyze shear-wave
              splitting for study of the near-fault stress state and its temporal variation;
              5) compare the fault healing at Hector Mine with that at Landers for
              understanding the fault interaction in a parallel-fault system. Through this
              project, we will obtain a better understanding for the relationships between
              the fault zone internal structure, rupture process, and earthquake cycle.
              Knowledge of spatial and temporal variations in the fault structure will help
              resolve more realistic macroscopic representations of fault-strength variations
              and the dynamic response of fault segments and fault networks as well as
              predict behavior of future earthquake.
