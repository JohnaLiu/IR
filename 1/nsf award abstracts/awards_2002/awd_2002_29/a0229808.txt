This project, proposes to advance
              methods of higher-level analysis of diigital spoken word repositories. 
              Starting with a rich collection of digitized audio resources, associated texts
              and images, and a set of integrated online annotation tools, the project will
              build integrated tools aimed at overcoming the lengthy and repetitive search
              and browse activity associiated with the use of such archives.  The poject
              willl also test the benefits to undergraduate learning of integrating the new
              resources into courses at the undergraduate level by measuring the effects of
              such indicators as the pace of content introduction and retention, and gains in
              aural literacy.  The IT research is primarily concerned with integration of
              existing technologies into custom tool kits for online learning environments.
              This is a collaborative effort of Michigan State University, Northwestern
              University and Glasgow Caledonian University in partnership with the National
              Archives and Records Adminiistration and the BBC-Information & Archives.
