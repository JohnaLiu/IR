This proposal is to pursue experimental studies of (1) high
              pressure melting behavior of candidate core materials, and (2) the properties
              of core-forming liquids at high pressure and high temperature using new
              synchrotron x-ray diffraction and absorption methods. For the proposed melting
              studies, the investigators will use the technique they established of
              identifying the onset of melting by the appearance of diffuse x-ray scattering
              from the melt with the simultaneous absence of crystalline diffraction.
              Research will be conducted on core materials using a double-sided laser heated
              diamond anvil cell system combined with an area detector and synchrotron x-ray
              beam. At the same time, the melting studies will lead to measurements of
              diffuse scattering of melts at high pressures by the brilliant synchrotron
              x-ray beam, providing important information on the local structure of melts
              and, further, the understanding of related macroscopic properties. Using
              monochromatic x-ray absorption, densities of core forming liquids at high
              pressure-temperature conditions will be determined, resulting in
              pressure-volume-temperature equations of state for melts in the Earth's deep
              interior. The success of these measurements will provide (1) melting curves for
              iron and iron alloys, (2) the structure and density of amorphous iron at high
              pressures and at room temperature, (3) the structure of crystalline iron phase
              near melting and the local structure of melts above melting, and (4) densities
              of melts (e.g., Fe-FeS) at high pressures. Combined these results will provide
              crucial constraints for dynamic, thermal and chemical differentiation models of
              the Earth.
