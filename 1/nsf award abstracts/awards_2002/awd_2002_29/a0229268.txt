Abstract    :
              The New York Hall of Science will develop "Connections," a 3,500-sq. ft.
              interactive exhibition and related learning resources that will introduce
              visitors to the fundamental technology of networks.  "Connections" will offer
              diverse audiences opportunities to explore networks, both natural and
              human-designed.  The exhibition will highlight the fundamental characteristics
              of networks such as their structure, function and adaptability.  The project
              will also produce supporting educational resources for families, after-school
              programs, community groups, students and teachers.  Audio-tours will be
              produced for general visitors and for visitors with visual impairments.  The
              Connections Discovery Lab, a 750-sq. ft. enclosed space adjacent to the
              exhibition, will offer scheduled workshops and drop-in programs.
