Abstract    :
              This award supports a science management office for a pilot ice-core drilling
              and analysis program to test the feasibility of obtaining well-dated,
              high-resolution isotope and chemistry records from East Antarctica.  Shallow
              ice cores will be obtained  from two locations: 1) ~100 km from South Pole
              towards the Pole of Inaccessibility, as an extension of the Byrd
              Station-to-South Pole ITASE traverse [International Trans Antarctic Scientific
              Expedition]; 2) at Taylor Dome, near the original deep coring site, and (3)
              possibly at AGO 3 and AGO 4 as part of a logistics traverse to these sites. All
              of the cores collected will be sampled at very high resolution (~1/2 cm) and
              analyzed for major ions.  Results from this calibration work, along with those
              from another project that is analyzing stable isotopes will be used to help
              plan a program of larger scope, with the objective of mapping the spatial
              expression of climate variability in East Antarctica.  Funds are also provided
              to organize a community workshop for coordination of the second phase of US
              ITASE and for one workshop per year for two years dedicated to writing and
              preparation of scientific papers from phase one of US ITASE.  In addition,
              route selection activities for the follow-on traverse activities in East
              Antarctica will be conducted using satellite image mapping.  A summary document
              will be produced and made available to the community to help with planning of
              related field programs (e.g. deep ice radar, firn radar  profiling, atmospheric
              chemistry, ice coring, snow surface properties for satellite observations, ice
              surface elevation and mass balance).
