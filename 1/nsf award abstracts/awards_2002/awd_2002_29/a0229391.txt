Abstract    :
              EAR-0229391

While Seismologists have long known that friction is one of the
              fundamental processes operating during earthquake rupture and slip, the actual
              physical mechanism behind the frictional behavior we believe we see in
              earthquakes remains elusive.  There are strong physical arguments that at the
              high slip rates seen in earthquakes, frictional heating of pore fluids could
              dynamically reduce the frictional stress, greatly increasing the stress drop. 
              Under even more extreme conditions, frictional melting of the fault zone may
              further affect the frictional environment.  We propose to investigate these
              processes by coupling a 1-D hydrothermal/poroelastic model for heat flow and
              fluid behavior with a 3-D dynamic faulting model for rupture and slip behavior.
               Using this combined method, we will be able to investigate the effects of
              thermal fluid pressurization and rock melting on fault stress, and determine
              the resulting effects on fault motion and radiated seismic waves.  Behaviors
              predicted by our models can be compared with seismic data for verification.
