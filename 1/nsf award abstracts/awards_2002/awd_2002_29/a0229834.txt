Geometrical and material heterogeneities in faults have
              long been viewed as a crucial feature affecting earthquake behavior.  More
              recently, the role of stress heterogeneities has begun to be recognized as a
              potentially central feature, particularly with the demonstration that stress
              heterogeneities alone already can produce a remarkably rich and complex set of
              earthquake-likebehaviors on uniform planar faults.  What is missing is an
              understanding of how the two types of heterogeneities, the static geometrical
              and material heterogeneities, and the dynamic stress heterogeneities, might
              combine and interact to produce even more realistic behavior. Building from
              earlier work in which we successfully integrated physical models of complex
              fault systems with the elastodynmics of repeating events, we are working to
              continue this line of research of the interaction of geometrical and dynamical
              heterogeneities. We are working to both further develop the theory, by further
              developing the modeling capability to extend from the scalar to the tensor
              case, and to further develop our ability to test the theory, by exploring the
              observable consequences.
