Chemical zoning of minerals in terms of their
              Fe/(Fe+Mg) value can be used to constrain the rates and nature of a variety of
              geological processes, if the rate of Fe-Mg interdiffusion is known for the
              minerals of interest.  The goal of this project is to measure Fe-Mg
              interdiffusion rates for the common minerals orthopyroxene and olivine as a
              function of temperature and oxygen fugacity.  Rutherford backscattering will be
              used to measure the Fe/(Fe+Mg) profiles produced in laboratory experiments. 
              This will permit very short (200 nm) compositional profiles to be measured. 
              Because of the comparatively slow rate of diffusion in orthopyroxene, previous
              attempts to measure Fe-Mg interdiffusion coefficients for orthopyroxene have
              been unsuccessful.  Diffusion in olivine will also be studied because of
              disagreement among published diffusion data sets for olivine and to extend the
              range of measurements to lower temperatures (600-900 degrees C).
