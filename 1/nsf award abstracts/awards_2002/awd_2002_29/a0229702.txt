The Stillwater complex is a large body of layered mafic
              igneous rock formed by fractional crystallization of a basaltic magma--the most
              common type of magma generated in the Earth. As minerals grow and separate from
              a crystallizing basaltic magma, its composition becomes increasingly enriched
              in elements not included in the minerals, termed incompatible elements.
              Incompatible elements are used in the study of igneous rocks to document
              tectonic settings, extents of melting of a source region, and extents of
              fractional crystallization. This study will document the behavior of
              incompatible elements during the final stages of the crystallization of the
              Stillwater complex by examining the distribution, abundance, and composition of
              the last rocks to have crystallized. The Stillwater complex is of both economic
              and academic interest, as it hosts the bulk of the platinum reserves of the US
              and is a natural laboratory for understanding basaltic liquid crystallization.
              An understanding of the end stages of fractional crystallization in this
              intrusion will provide a more reliable basis for interpreting incompatible
              elements concentrations in igneous systems in general. It will also help in
              understanding how platinum was concentrated to more than 1000 times normal in
              the mineralized parts of this intrusion.
