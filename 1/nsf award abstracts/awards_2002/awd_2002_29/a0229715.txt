Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project will develop
              automatic pitch error detection (pinpointing) for non-native speakers and
              determine whether software using this detection method helps people improve
              their pronunciation.  Over 50 million people worldwide spend over $50 billion
              per year learning to speak English.  Carnegie Speech's NativeAccent teaches
              English sounds and rhythm, but not pitch since its detection was unreliable in
              the past.  New detection methods, however, will enable the software to show
              differences between non-native and native speakers' utterances.  Correct pitch
              makes speech understandable over more than one sentence as the listener is
              guided from one high-content word to the next.  Recent cognitive science
              findings have produced successful techniques for training non-native speakers
              to contrast phone sounds.  This project will adapt those techniques to pitch
              contrast, specifically, tones in Mandarin.  Tonal training breaks the pitch
              problem down into one basic type variation, later building up to larger, more
              complex pitch contours and applying the techniques to English.  Trainees will
              use a game with feedback piloted by NativeAccent pinpointing and intelligent
              tutoring techniques.  Success in Phase 1 will be measured by whether people can
              be taught to produce tones more effectively with NativeAccent Pitch than with
              classical methods.
     If the major long term target application of this
              technology to enable effective English prosody instruction succeeds, the firm
              will have advanced the state-of-the-art in language teaching and will have
              provided an important capability to a number of people especially in business
              contexts for whom the ability to speak more than one language is becoming
              increasingly important   The system could be used across diverse educational
              settings and could be further extended to other languages.
