Abstract    :
              Our project will help the National Science Foundation as well as the larger STEM
              community understand how laboratory-teaching experiences are delivered using
              web-based information technologies. The project will ascertain how advanced
              web-mediated learning technologies are used to "convey" laboratory experiences
              in the undergraduate science and engineering curriculum. Our team will work to
              build on an existing database and begin to evaluate what student learning
              outcomes are being addressed. In addition, our final report will contain a
              formal literature , project goals, and a methodology. Our findings will be
              defended in a formal oral presentation to NSF personnel, WPI faculty and other
              invitees. Finally the results from our project will be presented at the annual
              Frontiers in Education Conference.
