Abstract    :
              This award supports a pilot ice-core drilling and analysis program to test the
              feasibility of obtaining well-dated, high-resolution isotope and chemistry
              records from East Antarctica.  Shallow ice cores will be obtained from two
              locations: 1) ~100 from South Pole towards North Victoria Land, as an extension
              of the Byrd Station-to-South Pole ITASE traverse [International Trans Antarctic
              Scientific Expedition]; 2) at Taylor Dome, near the original deep coring site. 
              Each of these cores will be sampled at very high resolution (~1/2 cm) and
              analyzed for stable isotope (delta D or delta 18-O) at the University of
              Washington.  The cores will also be analyzed for trace ions at the University
              of Maine, under separate funding.  The resulting time series, if they can be
              well dated as we expect, will be used to calibrate against the instrumental
              temperature record, brightness temperature observations from satellites and
              operational weather forecast reanalysis data sets.  Results from this
              calibration work will be used to help plan a program of larger scope, with the
              objective of mapping the spatial expression of climate variability in East
              Antarctica.  A summary document will be produced and made available to the
              community to help with planning of related field programs (e.g. deep ice radar,
              firn radar profiling, atmospheric chemistry, ice coring, snow surface
              properties for satellite observations, ice surface elevation and mass
              balance).
