This project will use high frequency seismic
              waves recorded at
seismograph stations of the International Monitoring System
              (IMS)
to map and model the fine structure of Earth's inner core. The
              same
properties and techniques that make IMS array stations useful
              for
detecting and locating nuclear weapons tests make them ideal
              for
observing the often faint seismic phases that interact with
the inner
              core. Although the inner core is quite small physically
it plays a large role
              with respect to the geodynamo, and more
generally with respect to heat
              transfer within the Earth. In the
same sense that ice cores can be used to
              deduce past climate
fluctuations it may be possible to use seismic models of
              the fine
radial structure of the inner core to constrain the history of
              Earth's
magnetic field.

The data gathered from IMS stations will be
              processed with
standard array techniques such as beamforming, fk analysis,
              and
phase-weighted stacking to observe core reflections (ScP, PcP,
PKiKP,
              SKiKP) and refractions (PKPbc, PKPdf). Relative properties
among phases
              recorded on the same seismogram will be used to
mitigate the effect of shallow
              structure. Specific research
targets include using PcP/PKiKP amplitude ratios
              to constrain
the shear velocity at the top of the inner core and the
              density
jump across the inner core-outer core boundary (ICB),
              modeling
precritical PKiKP phases to constrain the thickness of the
              ICB,
evaluating the hypothesis of an anisotropic discontinuity beneath
the
              ICB using quasi-polar PKPbc and PKPdf phases, and evaluating
the inner-core
              scattering hypothesis by analyzing the coda
of precritical PKiKP phases in the
              transparent zone.
