The present proposal is aimed at understanding
              relationships between geochemical tracers such as helium and carbon dioxide and
              the occurrence of seismicity along the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) in
              Turkey. In collaboration with Turkish colleagues, who are monitoring major and
              minor element geochemistry and other isotope systems (18O, D/H and tritium), we
              plan to sample fluids for helium and carbon (from production wells and surface
              springs) from nine previously-monitored geothermal localities sited along an
              800-km active segment of the NAFZ.  These two geothermal tracers have great
              utility in their ability to distinguish crustal and mantle inputs to the
              volatile inventory.  We want to test the hypothesis - seen in other studies of
              earthquake-prone regions - that changes in the balance between mantle- and
              crustal-derived volatiles have potential as a precursor of impeding seismic
              activity. The western segment of the NAFZ region experienced two catastrophic
              earthquakes in 1999 entailing more than 25,000 fatalities: it continues to be
              seismically active. This work, aimed at understanding how crustal fluids
              respond to seismic events, has clear societal relevance.  In addition, prior
              work carried out through collaborative efforts with our Turkish colleagues has
              discovered that mantle-derived 3He occurs in fluids along the entire strike
              (~800 km) of the active western segment of the NAFZ.  The presence of a
              mantle-derived fluid component indicates leakage across the ductile-brittle
              transition region of the seismogenic zone. The same observation has been made
              for the San Andreas Fault System (SAFS) in California. Indeed there are many
              other parallels between the NAFZ and the SAFS. Information gained in the
              present study, particularly on the distribution of seismicity along the NAFZ
              and the westward progression of epicenters (towards the metropolis of
              Istanbul), may be applicable to the SAFZ.
