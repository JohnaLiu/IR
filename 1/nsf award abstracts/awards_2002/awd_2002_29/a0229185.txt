Abstract    :
              This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs of the National Science
              Foundation, provides support for a research-planning workshop for Antarctic
              lithospheric research. The workshop, entitled "The Structure and Evolution of
              the Antarctic Plate (SEAP) 2003 Workshop," will be held in Boulder, Colorado,
              between March 3 and 5, 2003. There are five principal purposes for the
              workshop:(1) to highlight outstanding scientific problems for the next 10 years
              concerning the structure and evolution of the Antarctic Plate;(2) to discuss
              the feasibility of an ambitious initiative in the Austral geosciences, seen as
              the next generation of earth-based geophysical instrumentation on Antarctica
              and on and beneath the Austral seas, with primary emphasis on the broad-band
              seismic component ''Antarctic-Array'');(3) to identify auxiliary program needs
              to complement Antarctic-Array, in particular the roles of marine
              geology/geophysics and geodynamical modeling;(4) to discuss the relationship to
              other research initiatives that have originated both within (e.g., REVEAL,
              ANDRILL, ANTEC) and outside of the traditional Antarctic geoscience community;
              and (5) to develop a preliminary SEAP science plan. The workshop is expected to
              draw participants from both the US and international research communities. A
              report of the workshop will be produced within a few months after the workshop
              concludes.
