Abstract    :
              This study will focus on compiling existing knowledge from arctic water balance
              studies. This will be accomplished through 1) data collection through a survey
              of individual sites, 2) integrated data set development, and 3) comparative
              analysis. This research will create a unique database of water balance elements
              for the high latitude basins. The data will be used to compare and understand
              the water balance results from high latitude watersheds, with special emphasis
              on inter-annual variability, regional variability, long-term averages of the
              various hydrologic components (annual and seasonal), methodology for
              computations and scientific framework. Common issues, both strengths and
              weaknesses in northern hydrologic studies will be identified and collaborative
              research efforts to address these common issues will be recommended. The
              overall goal of this effort is to advance our understanding of circumpolar
              hydrologic processes through the synthesis of existing international data sets.
