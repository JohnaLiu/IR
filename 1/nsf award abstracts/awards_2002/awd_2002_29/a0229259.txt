Abstract    :
              A "Workshop on Computational Sciences, Mathematics, and Engineering" is planned
              for the fall of 2002.  The purpose of the workshop is to develop a planning
              document for future research directions and resources needed to advance the
              solution of a limited number of significant problems of national interest. 
              These "core problems," which will be selected by the workshop participants,
              will provide a focus to define the generic issues of a computational science
              discipline.  The core problems will be addressed through collaborations among
              application scientists, mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists.
               A workshop report will be produced and disseminated that will summarize the
              discussion and conclusions of the workshop.  A web site is planned as part of
              the effort.
