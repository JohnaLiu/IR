Abstract    :
              With the increased emphasis on the application of statistical techniques in
              hands on and practical settings, it is important for members of academic
              statistical community to develop working relationship with other academicians
              and members of the private and governmental sector to create active research
              consortiums. This collaboration between North Carolina State University,
              Spelman College, and members of governmental agencies presents an innovative
              solution to addressing the needs of getting more practical applications of
              statistical techniques by statistics students while assisting in the management
              of huge and complicated data sets obtained by governmental agencies. The
              collaboration stems from the Environmental Statistics Practicum developed and
              tested at North Carolina State University and the program adapts the current
              practices of this successful endeavor for use at Spelman College. 

The
              development of protocols for training undergraduates in analyzing complicated
              data sets and analyzing environmental data to make better environmental policy
              decisions using modern statistical techniques lends itself to the intellectual
              merit of the proposed project. In addition, the broader impacts are established
              through the retaining of undergraduate students in the graduate studies
              pipeline in order to pursue higher educational aspirations, adaptation and
              adoption of these programs in a historically black college for women, and
              developing student - industry interactions that lead to successful employment
              in STEM related careers.
