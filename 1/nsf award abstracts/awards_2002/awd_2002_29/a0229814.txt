The investigators propose to use magnetotelluric
              (MT) sounding to constrain the temperature and melt fraction of plume material
              in the Yellowstone-Snake River region, and provide constraints on models of the
              dynamics of the Yellowstone plume flow and its interaction with a continent. 
              Several previous studies have indicated the presence of a narrow, low P-wave
              velocity beneath the eastern Snake River Plain in Idaho, aligned in the
              direction of motion of the Yellowstone hotspot.  The lower seismic velocities
              can be attributed to the combined effects of temperature differences, partial
              melt, and compositional differences resulting from melt segregation.  The
              investigators propose to deploy long period MT sounding instruments along two
              perpendicular lines:  the first a northwest to southeast transect for which a
              P-wave velocity model was previously obtained from tomographic inversion, the
              second centered along the Snake River Plain.  Given that the conductivity of
              olivine-rich rocks is strongly dependent upon both melt fraction and
              temperature, interpretation of MT sounding data can be used to determine mantle
              temperatures and melt fraction, hence yielding an estimate of plume viscosity.
