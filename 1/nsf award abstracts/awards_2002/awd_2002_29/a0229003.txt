Abstract    :
              The NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Intelligent
              Maintenance Systems (IMS) has developed a joint collaborative project with the
              Condition Based maintenance Labs of University of Toronto in Canada to advance
              the prognostics tools to augment the research capabilities at the Intelligent
              Maintenance Systems Center.  This international project will develop a
              Collaborative Informatics Platform for Prognostics and maintenance Optimization
              by integrating smart prognostics agent and hybrid Proportional Hazard Model and
              Time Depended Markov Chain to enhance the effectiveness of the predictive
              maintenance system.  This integration will further enhance the prognostics
              capabilities to achieve the vision of near-zero-downtime performance of the IMS
              Center.

The results of this joint project will be shared among the company
              members of both the Center on Intelligent Maintenance Systems and the Condition
              Based Maintenance Labs of the University of Toronto.
