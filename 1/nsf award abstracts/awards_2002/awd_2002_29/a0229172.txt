Abstract    :
              0229172  Huang  The fate of antimicrobials in the environment will be
              investigated.  The oxidation of three classes of these materials (those
              containing phenol, aniline or piperizine) with manganese, iron, and aluminum
              oxides and with oxide-rich soils will be studied to identify susceptibility to
              oxidation.  Oxidation products, structure-activity relationships, reaction
              kinetics, mechanisms and pathways will be elucidated.
