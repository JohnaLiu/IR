Abstract    :
              The Potwar Plateau in Pakistan is a 5-10 km thick assemblage of rocks all
              younger than 450 million years that are being driven southward over a salt-rich
              decollement by tectonic forces at approximately 10 mm/year.  The investigations
              are seeking to establish whether aseismic creep is a significant component of
              the translation process of this 150 km x150 km province, or whether the Plateau
              is locked, partly or completely, and slips during earthquakes.  Global
              Positioning (GPS) methods are used to examine the deformation process, both as
              displacements of colonial trigonometrical points installed in 1850, and as
              annual motions of newly installed geodetic markers. If the Plateau is currently
              locked it will have important consequences for earthquake hazards in the
              region. If it is creeping rapidly this will have important implications for the
              structural formation and deformation of the Plateau, a region steeped with oil
              reservoirs.  The Potwar Plateau is representative of numerous geologic
              decollements documented in earth's history, and its present kinematic behavior
              can place bounds on the types of deformation that have occurred within them.
