Abstract    :
              The Space Science Institute will refurbish its 5,000 square foot traveling
              exhibition, "MarsQuest:  Exploring the Red Planet"  (ESI-9705377), enhancing
              the exhibition with new components that incorporate recent data from ongoing
              Mars missions, and extending its national tour for an additional three years. 
              Enhancements include exhibits on Mars' weather, exobiology and the addition of
              a photo-realistic rotating Mars globe.  Additional improvements include models
              of the NASA Mars exploration rover and an online kiosk to make additional
              information available to visitors after they leave the exhibition.  MarsQuest
              is fully booked and there is a waiting list for a second three-year tour.  The
              proposed refurbishment and enhancements will occur at the end of the current
              tour in 2003, with the new tour beginning early 2004.
