Abstract    :
              This workshop to be held in Boston, MA on August 15 - 17, 2002 on in
              "Environmentally Benign Processing Research Needs" will bring together some of
              the key people in the environmental processing area and will closely look at
              the pollution emissions from the various industries. Discussions will be
              focused on identifying potential solutions capable of converting the waste
              byproducts to value-added products. Thus, simultaneously significantly
              minimizing pollution emissions from the industrial waste byproducts and
              generating a profit from the value-added products.
