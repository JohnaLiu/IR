Abstract    :
              Failure modes of sand and sandstone play an important role in construction of
              engineering structures, optimization of water resources and related contaminant
              remediation, production of oil and gas, well bore stability analyses, and
              earthquake hazard mitigations. Two distinct failure modes are recognized in
              terms of their geometry and micromechanics: sharp planar discontinuities and
              tabular zones of localized deformation. The tabular zones of localized
              deformation include shear, compaction, and dilation bands and are the focus of
              this study. Tabular failure structures in unconsolidated sand and sandstone
              from a variety of depositional, burial, and regional tectonic settings are
              mapped and sampled. These samples are studied using thin-section petrography,
              scanning-electron microscopy, and X-ray computerized tomography to characterize
              the failure modes and the associated grain fracture and porosity variation. The
              relationships between grain size, porosity, cementation, loading conditions,
              burial depth and deformation history on the failure processes are then
              established. This study is designed to constrain the effect of the
              environmental and mechanical conditions on the natural failure modes of
              unconsolidated sand and sandstone by comparing them with those of
              experimentally derived constitutive laws and those predicted by mathematical
              and numerical models. The ultimate objective of this study is to provide a
              predictive tool for the failure behavior of granular rock in various
              environments, which is so relevant to many societal issues.
