This proposal requests funding for work in a new
              experimental fluid
mechanics laboratory at UCLA. The lab will utilize two, new
              powerful
diagnostic techniques to provide high-resolution, quantitative
              velocity
measurements of simulated convection in the Earth's outer core.
              The
results will test long-held theories regarding the properties
              of
convective flows in core fluids and will provide a
              detailed
characterization of flow dynamics at nearly planetary parameter
              values.
The first project will use the recently developed technique of
              acoustic
Doppler velocimetry to study convecting liquid metals, which
              have
physical properties similar to that of the molten outer core.
              The
results will test the linear stability theory of
              rotating
magnetoconvection, the foundation of modern dynamo theory.
              Established
by Chandrasekhar in the 1950's, this stability theory has only
              undergone
a single prior experimental investigation that reached the
              asymptotic
regime. The second project will utilize the optical technique
              of
particle image velocimetry (PIV), applying it to a rotating
              spherical
shell of convecting water, a set-up that mimics the dynamics and
              the
geometry of the outer core. PIV will provide, for the first
              time,
quantitative measurements of the flow fields (velocity, vorticity
              and
helicity) that are believed to be essential components of the
              geodynamo,
but have never been measured adequately by experimental
              means.
Furthermore, the experimental design will enable PIV to
              measure
convection in the polar regions, which have not been studied
              extensively
but now appear to be significant. Together, these
              state-of-the-art
acoustic and optical velocimetry techniques will provide
              benchmarks for
numerical and theoretical studies of core convection and the
              geodynamo.
They will also generate the highest resolution experimental
              convection
data to date for interpreting geomagnetic and seismic observations
              of
the deep Earth.
