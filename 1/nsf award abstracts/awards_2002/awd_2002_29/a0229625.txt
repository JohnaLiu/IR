Abstract    :
              The Miami Museum of Science, in collaboration with the Science Museum of
              Minnesota, will develop a 5000-sq. ft. interactive, bilingual traveling
              exhibition titled "Amazon Voyage: Vicious Fishes and Other
Riches."  The
              exhibition will immerse visitors in the Amazon's rich diversity through direct
              contact with some of its most (ill-deservedly) notorious denizens. 
              Spotlighting the rarely seen research conducted by renowned North- and South
              American scientists, "Amazon Voyage" will present visitors with the scientists'
              ongoing work.  Visitors will discover that economy and ecology of the Amazon
              are intertwined, and explore their own connection to this region through the
              global trade in ornamental fish, arriving at a heightened appreciation of how
              personal choices can influence environmental outcomes.
