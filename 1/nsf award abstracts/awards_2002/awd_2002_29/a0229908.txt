Abstract    :
              This project develops instructional materials to support in-class instruction of
              introductory programming. The materials supplement existing curricula to
              encourage greater student participation and understanding and are compatible
              with many teaching styles and modes of instruction. The approach is to
              specialize various Classroom Assessment Techniques (CATs) [Angelo and Cross
              1993] for use in introductory programming classes.  CATs provide a mechanism
              for students to supply feedback to the instructor about the instructor's
              teaching, about the course material, and about their own learning. CATs can
              also be used to create more active learning experiences for students by
              engaging them in classroom activities. The CATs developed in this project will
              be evaluated in introductory computer science courses at the University of
              Washington. 
 
The goals for the materials include: to provide active
              learning experiences for students in introductory computing courses, to provide
              instructors a means to assess students, understanding of introductory
              programming concepts, and to widen the communication channel between students
              and the instructor. 

Classroom Assessment Techniques and supporting
              technology will be constructed to accomplish these goals.   The deliverables
              for this project are: 
- Classroom assessment tools for use in CS1/CS2 courses
              based on either C/C++ or Java. 
- Preliminary usage notes for instructors on
              how to use individual assessments in class. 
- Prototype work on technological
              support for classroom assessments. 

The materials will be evaluated through
              four quarters of classroom use at UW.  At the end of the project, the classroom
              assessment tools will be made available for other instructors to use.  The
              distribution mechanism will be to publish the materials available on the web
              for instructors to download them.
