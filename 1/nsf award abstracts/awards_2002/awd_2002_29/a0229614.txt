Abstract    :
              Laboratory experiments are carried out on three fluid systems that manifest
              processes important in the dynamics of terrestrial and planetary atmospheres: 
              (1) Nonlinear waves and turbulence in a rotating cylinder driven by a
              differentially rotating lid.  Instabilities in this system lead to rotating
              waves that deviate from smooth circular or elliptical shape by having sharp
              corners.  These so-called "polygonal" waves are similar in appearance to waves
              observed in hurricane eyewalls and in the polar atmosphere of Saturn.  (2)
              Instability and wave formation in a rotating hydraulic jump.  A circular
              hydraulic jump in a rotating outflow layer is an alternative mechanism for the
              formation of polygonal waves.  (3) The structure and mechanics of precessing
              mean flows in turbulent rotating convection.  Direct measurements of eddy
              stresses and mean flow profiles will explain the mechanism of mean-flow
              generation in rotating turbulent convection.

These experiments provide data
              on nonlinear flows analogous to those in the atmosphere that are difficult to
              obtain by any other means.  Moreover, they give the information needed to
              evaluate small-scale turbulence parameterization in large-eddy simulations
              (LES) of geophysical flows.  Controlled laboratory experiments that involve
              constraints similar to those in the atmosphere (particularly rotation and
              stratification) provide a valuable testing ground.  These and similar
              laboratory experiments are used in graduate and undergraduate classes to
              demonstrate fundamental fluid processes of relevance to atmospheric science.
