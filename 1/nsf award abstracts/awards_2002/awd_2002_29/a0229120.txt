Chemical transport in groundwater is often studied in the
              laboratory setting which may differ considerably from the natural settings in
              terms of heterogeneity of the sediment and the scales involved, both temporal
              and spatial.  To assess the in-situ transport rates, this project makes use of
              the distributions of naturally occurring uranium- and thorium-series isotopes
              in an aquifer system.  238U and 232Th in rocks decay to stable isotopes of Pb
              through a series of intermediate daughters consisting of elements with diverse
              chemical properties and a wide range of decay mean lives.  These decay-series
              isotopes enter groundwater as a result of water-rock interaction.  Their
              abundance and ratios in groundwater evolve as the water passes through rock
              media, with resultant parent-daughter disequilibrium relationships providing
              quantitative constraints on subsurface geochemical reactions and transport
              processes on various time scales.  We will conduct this multi-tracer research
              in a regional aquifer system known as the Memphis aquifer at the Shelby County
              area in western Tennessee.  In connection with the determination of groundwater
              recharge, it has been a research study site for interdisciplinary studies
              involving geochemistry, environmental tracers, numerical modeling and sediment
              analysis.  We will collect groundwater from various locations and aquifer
              depths for isotopic measurements of 238U and 234U), thorium (234Th, 230Th,
              228Th, and 232Th), radium (226Ra, 228Ra, and 224Ra),, lead (210Pb), polonium
              (210Po) and radon (222Rn).  Measurements will also be made on aquifer solids
              and colloidal particles.  Modeling the observed radioactive disequilibria in
              fluids and colloids will be attempted to quantify the kinetics of water-rock
              interactions (e.g., rates of adsorption/desorption and
              precipitation/dissolution) and their effects on chemical transport and
              subsurface flows.  The model results, to be tested by the measured
              disequilibria in the sorbed phases of rocks, allow calibration of transport
              models developed from small-scale, natural, undisturbed flow system, and may
              reveal new processes that are not apparent in laboratory studies or field
              manipulation experiments.  It is anticipated that the research will provide new
              insights into the colloidal associations of radioisotopes in groundwater. 
              Through an enhanced understanding of long-term subsurface contaminant
              transport, the research has the practical benefit of strengthening the
              scientific basis for risk assessment and management of nuclear wastes stored in
              geologic systems.
