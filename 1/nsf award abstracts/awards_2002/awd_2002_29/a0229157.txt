Institution: DePaul University


 

This proposal requests
              funds for a conference on Harmonic
Analysis to be held at DePaul University,
              Chicago, during
the period December 6--8, 2002. Several top researchers
              in
Harmonic Analysis from the Calderon-Zygmund school will
participate. The
              conference will include eight one-hour
talks over the three days plus several 
              half-hour
talks. In addition,  A problem session in the afternoon of
the last
              day is planned.

A substantial part of NSF funds will be use to support
              
graduate students, junior faculty, woman and minorities.
