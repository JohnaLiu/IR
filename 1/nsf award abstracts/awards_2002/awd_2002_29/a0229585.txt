Abstract    :
              Saffer EAR-0229585

Defining physical and mechanical properties of fault gouge
              and their 
relationship to fault behavior remains a fundamental step toward
              
understanding earthquakes and faulting. Frictional velocity 
dependence is
              considered the most likely mechanism to explain 
differences between stable
              sliding (aseismic) and unstable stick-slip 
(seismogenic) behavior. Materials
              that exhibit velocity-strengthening 
behavior produce only inherently stable
              frictional slip, whereas 
those that exhibit velocity-weakening are capable of
              hosting unstable 
rupture. This work will define the frictional properties of
              a suite 
of natural and synthetic mixed-mineralogy gouges, as a function of
              
composition. The experimental plan will focus on testing (1) natural
              
samples of subduction zone materials that have undergone progressive
              
alteration at temperatures up to ~250 degrees C, and (2) a suite of
              
synthetic mixtures of montmorillonite, illite, and quartz, and 
developing
              the appropriate constitutive equations to describe their 
behavior. This work
              will include: (1) quantitative x-ray diffraction 
(XRD) to determine the
              composition of natural gouges, (2) a series of 
shearing experiments for each
              material, over a wide range of 
experimental conditions, and (3) petrographic
              and SEM 
characterization of microstructures in experimentally deformed gouges
              
and comparison with natural microstructures observed in the sample
              
localities.  The work will provide high-quality measurements of 
frictional
              constitutive properties for realistic natural fault gouge 
materials relevant
              to seismic faulting, and define variations in 
these properties with gouge
              composition. This work will constitute an 
important step toward a better
              understanding of fault behavior and 
its potential variability with depth and
              along-strike. In addition, 
detailed characterization of fabric development in
              experimentally 
deformed gouges will provide important insights into
              application of 
laboratory measurements to natural faults.
