Title:  Orientation coupling between
              solid particles and liquid crystalline matrix

The liquid-crystalline
              polymers (LCP) used in various products show a strong tendency to align along
              the flow direction.  Since the LCP orientation is frozen in the solid state
              product, because of the anisotropy, the tensile strength and modulus will be
              small in the transverse direction.  In some products, such as injection molded
              LCP materials, the product isotropy is important and highly desirable.  The
              method based on surface-anchoring filler additives to alter the transport
              properties of the LCP during the manufacturing processes, is an innovative
              approach proposed by the PI in this exploratory project.
