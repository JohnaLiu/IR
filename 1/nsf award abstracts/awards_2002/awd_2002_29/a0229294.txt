Abstract    :
              "Explore Evolution" is a three-year project that uses a combination of traveling
              exhibits and activity kits to introduce the concept of evolution to museum
              audiences and 4-H groups.  Six museum partners will collaborate on the
              development of eleven interactive exhibit modules on the following topics: 
              disease in humans, eye development in animals, fruit fly diversity, sexual
              selection, hominoid development and extinction.  The museum consortium includes
              the Kansas Museum and Biodiversity Center, Museum of the Rockies (MT), Sam
              Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History, Science Museum of Minnesota,
              University of Nebraska State Museum and the Exhibits Museum of the University
              of Michigan.  The inquiry-based activity kits will be modeled after the
              University of Nebraska-Lincoln's "Wonderwise" kits, funded in part by NSF, and
              designed for middle school audiences.  An "Explore Evolution" website will be
              launched to support the exhibits and activity kits.  Dissemination will occur
              through museum education programs as well as a consortium of 4-H programs in
              Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Michigan, Nebraska and Wyoming.  It is anticipated
              that more than 1.8 million museum visitors and 800,000 4-H members will
              participate in this project.
