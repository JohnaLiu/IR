The cycling of rocks between the Earth's surface and
              interior affects everything from the evolution of the crust and mantle to the
              composition of the atmosphere. To quantify the processes occurring during
              subduction and exhumation of rocks, geoscientists utilize a broad range of
              tools, one of the most important of which is the distribution of stable
              isotopes. The fractionation of stable isotopes of carbon changes significantly
              with temperature. The carbon isotope distribution between calcite and graphite
              is particularly important because it has the potential to provide temperature
              information about metamorphic processes. Recent developments in secondary ion
              mass spectrometry have lead to new insights into graphite precipitation during
              metamorphism and hold promise to advance our understanding of the temperatures
              and rates of metamorphic processes. However, these interpretations rely on
              graphite growth data that has been extrapolated over significant temperature
              and pressure ranges, as well as empirically calibrated fractionation
              relationships that have not been experimentally verified. This work will
              provide direct experimental measurements of these factors, and will help
              understand the cycling process within the Earth.
