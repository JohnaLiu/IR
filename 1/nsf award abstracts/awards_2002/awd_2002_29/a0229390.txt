Abstract    :
              The goal of this Planning Grant is to use program theory as a tool in two
              informal science education communities and compare the processes and models
              that result.  Program theory is built on the principle that learning and social
              behavioral change is the result of the cumulative effect of multiple programs,
              rather than a single experience.  The participating communities are the Tucson
              Association of Museums (TAM) and the Terrific Resources for Environmental
              Education (TREE) organization in Columbus, Ohio.  Each organization will work
              collaboratively using cross-group program theory and logic modeling to initiate
              a discussion on program planning and an intra-group evaluation.  It is
              anticipated that this project will result in collaborations between the Tucson
              and Ohio informal science education communities and the creation of a plan for
              evaluation of the processes involved with this work.
