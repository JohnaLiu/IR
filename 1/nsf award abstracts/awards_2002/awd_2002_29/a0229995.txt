Mantle xenoliths and ophiolites (preserved oceanic
              lithosphere) from eastern North America will be studied with the purpose of
              constraining the evolution of mantle lithosphere from the Archean through the
              Mesozoic Atlantic rifting. These two different suites sample different mantle
              regions and will return complementary information on the evolution of the
              subcontinental lithospheric mantle, and the convecting athenospheric mantle
              which gives rise to oceanic lithosphere. The first goal of this work is to
              characterize a set of mantle xenoliths found in lamprophyre dikes and
              kimberlites in upstate New York, Vermont, and Quebec. These xenoliths hold
              information about the evolution of the mantle under eastern North America from
              the Archean to the Cretaceous.
 
The second goal will be to determine the
              Re-Os systematics of chromites from tectonically emplaced ophiolites spanning
              the length of the Appalachians. These ophiolites all crystallized and were
              emplaced within a short period of time during the Ordovician. This sample set
              will allow an evaluation of the heterogeneity of the convecting mantle with
              respect to osmium isotopes, and of the possible role of subducting slab-derived
              osmium during the formation of supra-subduction zone ocean
              lithosphere.

Undergraduate student researchers will perform much of the work
              outlined in this proposal as part of independent research or senior thesis
              projects. The major contributions of this study will be a better understanding
              of the processes of creation of lithosphere during mountain-building events.
