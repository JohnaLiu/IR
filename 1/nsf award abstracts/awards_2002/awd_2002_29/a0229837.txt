This work is an experimental investigation of
              reactions that synthesize abiotic organic compounds in geologic environments.
              Although the common occurrence of abiotic hydrocarbons in geologic samples
              indicates that their formation has been widespread throughout the history of
              the Earth, the circumstances under which these compounds form remain poorly
              understood. The study will employ several experimental approaches to examine
              reaction pathways for the formation of organic compounds from reduction of CO2,
              and define the geologic conditions that allow these reactions to proceed. 
In
              particular, the experiments will address: 
(i) the role of aqueous phase
              versus vapor phase reactions in abiotic organic synthesis, 
(ii) the
              generation of abiotic hydrocarbons during hydrothermal alteration of
              olivine-rich rocks (serpentinization), and 
(iii) formation of graphite and
              organic matter during thermal decomposition of iron-bearing carbonates.  
The
              results will enhance our understanding of the origin of abiotic organic
              compounds in geologic samples such as igneous rocks, hydrothermal fluids,
              serpentinites, and meteorites. This information will be useful in constraining
              the magnitude of the flux of abiotic hydrocarbons and their potential role in
              global carbon cycles. The results will also be useful in understanding the
              contribution of abiotic sources to the reduced carbon found in rock samples
              from the early Earth, and in defining sources of prebiotic organic compounds
              for the origin and early evolution of life.
