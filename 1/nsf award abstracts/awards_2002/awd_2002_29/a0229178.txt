Abstract    :
              This project involves a grant for training in ethnographic research methods to
              the department of anthropology at Southern Methodist University. The funds will
              be used over a period of five years to insure that Ph.D. students in
              social/cultural anthropology who take a specified course of study in scientific
              research design and methodology have fieldwork experience before they begin
              their Ph.D. research. This activity is important to insure that the training of
              social scientists is as well-developed as possible, so that the new cohort of
              social researchers will be capable of advancing our knowledge of contemporary
              problems as well as of basic research issues.
