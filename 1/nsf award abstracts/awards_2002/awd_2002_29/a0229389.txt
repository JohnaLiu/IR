Abstract    :
                  9704344  Phillips  The proposal was evaluated by four reviewers, resulting
              in  ratings of Excellent (1) Very Good (2), and Good (1).  Review Analysis: The
              outcome of the review was an overall  show of support for the proposed project.
               The proposal, for  example, was characterized by most of the reviewers as 
              focusing on an important topic, conceptually and  methodologically sound,
              involving quite capable  investigators, and likely to lead to useful results. 
              Even  the one reviewer who was more critical noted that the  project would have
              significant impact because of its  educational component.  Recommended Action:
              An outstanding  team of researchers has been assembled to carry out this 
              research, which would involve cross-university collaboration  and provide
              important experience for participating students.  The team includes an
              up-and-coming younger investigator and  two senior researchers who are at the
              top of the field.  The  topic is very important, and the research would be
              guided by  a well-conceived conceptual and methodological plan.  A  three-year
              continuing award is recommended.  ***
