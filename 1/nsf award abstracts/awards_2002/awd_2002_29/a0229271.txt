Abstract    :
              Behavioral Ecology of Vocal Diversity

Vocal mimicry appears to be a
              pre-adaptation for the evolution of speech in humans, and the reasons for its
              independent evolution in other species are of great interest. Although
              songbirds show vocal mimicry, this is usually limited to the male sex, only a
              portion of the vocal repertoire, acquisition during a short age span, and
              breeding contexts. In contrast, and more like humans, mimicry for most of the
              vocal repertoire is seen in both sexes of parrots throughout life and in nearly
              all social contexts. Why parrots have evolved vocal mimicry remains a mystery.
              This project examines the functions of vocal mimicry in three wild parrot
              species in Costa Rica and Bonaire. Using advanced interactive playback and
              array recording technology, the project will test a detailed series of
              hypotheses concerning the role of vocal mimicry in mediating the highly dynamic
              fission/fusion of wild parrot groups, and the establishment of local dominance
              within such groups. The three species represent different ecological contexts
              and taxonomic affinities which should allow for the extraction of general
              patterns. The study will concurrently provide important data for tropical
              parrot conservation and training in advanced field techniques to both local
              residents and U.S. students.
