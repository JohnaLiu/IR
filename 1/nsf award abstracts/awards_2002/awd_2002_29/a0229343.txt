The proposal includes three tasks. In Task I, we will work
              with Campbell Scientific Inc. to design and build a TDL system for continuous
              and in-situ measurement of HDO and H218O isotope ratios in atmospheric water
              vapor. The instrument will be tested against a cold-trap method, used at Yale
              and elsewhere. In Task II, we will use the new TDL system to determine the
              isotopic ratio in water vapor evaporating from the earth's surface and
              exchanging with the lower atmosphere. The isotope flux ratio will be determined
              with the micrometeorological gradient-diffusion and eddy accumulation methods.
              The ability to determine the flux ratio accurately is essential in two fields
              of science: plant-water relationships and paleo-climate.  In Task III, we will
              obtain and interpret continuous time series of stable water isotope ratio in
              surface air on time scales including boundary layer gusts, rain showers, the
              diurnal cycle, frontal cyclones and seasons. The advantage of our continuous
              time series is that we will be able to observe a variety of atmospheric
              processes operating on different time scales. We expect that the isotopic
              method will be extraordinarily sensitive to subtle changes in water vapor
              condensation and evaporation history of an airmass

Successful completion of
              these tasks will open a new "window" on the hydrologic cycle, especially to
              processes involving phase changes of water. The project will also generate
              broader impact on the society by promoting partnership between the academia and
              a private industry and by contributing new instrumentation to the
              infrastructure for research in hydrology, ecology, meteorology and global
              change.
