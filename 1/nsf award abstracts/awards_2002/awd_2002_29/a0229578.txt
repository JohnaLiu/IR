From the Red River in 1997 and 2001, to North Carolina's Tar
              River in 1999, to the Mississippi River in 1993, 1995, 2001, and again in 2002,
              recurrent flooding has led to assertions that human activities have increased
              the magnitude and frequency of large river flooding.  The hypothesis of human
              flood forcing, however, remains unverified and politically controversial, and a
              recent National Research Council panel concluded that "there are ...  few cases
              where human impacts on flood magnitude and frequency have been carefully
              documented".

The purpose of the research proposed here is to provide an
              empirical, system-wide tool for quantifying human forcing of flood stages on
              the Mississippi River system.  We propose to document and quantify these
              connections using a pooled time-series analysis, a multivariate technique for
              testing the correlation between one or more dependent variables (here, stage
              magnification) and independent variables that have both cross-sectional and
              temporal variability.  Magnification of flood hazard will be measured using
              specific-gage analysis of long-duration gaging stations on the study rivers. 
              The specific-gage technique quantifies changes in the stage response to fixed
              discharge conditions relative to baseline historical conditions, thereby
              isolating the local effects of river engineering and channel modification.  In
              order to quantify the potential independent variables, we will construct a GIS
              database of engineering structures and their history of emplacement and
              modification over the past 70-100 years on the study rivers.  A database of
              this kind was a major recommendation of the Interagency Floodplain Management
              review following the 1993 flood.  This database will be constructed for the
              analyses proposed here and then will be disseminated for widespread access and
              use. 

Local and regional engineering activities on U.S. rivers currently are
              being reviewed, authorized, and their relative costs and benefits assessed with
              little or no recognition that these activities may raise flood levels, lower
              recurrence times, or cause increased economic losses in future floods.  The
              research proposed here would provide a tool for empirical assessment of the
              impact on flood levels of any incremental engineering addition to the
              Mississippi or other similar rivers.  Engineers, planners, and politicians
              should seek to reach an equitable balance between 1) the local benefits of
              flood control and navigation improvements and 2) the elevated flood risk that
              these structures may cause.
