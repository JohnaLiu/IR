The proposed Tenth Engineering Foundation Conference on
              risk-based decision making represents the natural growth of the field and the
              culmination of the theory, methodology, and applications in risk assessment and
              management o water resources and natural and man-made hazards.  The most
              striking observation is that the objectives and goals set forth for the first
              conference in September 1980 in Asilomar, CA and the issues raised in the
              preface of the 1980 proceedings are as relevant and as timely today as they
              were then.  After the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on
              September II, 200 1, and the subsequent anthrax mailings, the United States can
              no longer afford to respond to threats on an ad hoc basis.
