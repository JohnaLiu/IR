Abstract    :
              The Brooklyn Children's Museum (BCM) will develop "LifeTrek," a 6000-sq. ft.
              permanent exhibition and related educational extensions.  LifeTrek will be an
              integrated learning environment comprised of a series of immersive indoor
              habitats where children will investigate natural phenomena and processes. 
              Designed for urban children ages 4-11 and their families and teachers, LifeTrek
              will provide a range of open-ended and challenging opportunities to practice
              science skills, and facilitate greater awareness of and respect for the natural
              world.  Reflecting the ecological framework in which New York City resides, a
              northern estuary system, the exhibition will feature twelve object-rich
              habitats:  stream's edge, flowing stream, freshwater pond, salt marsh, tidal
              pool, shore, dune, cliff, cave, meadow, fallen log and living tree.
