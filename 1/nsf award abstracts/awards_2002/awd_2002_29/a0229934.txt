Abstract    :
              This study is part is an interdisciplinary program to determine the spatial and
              temporal characteristics of ongoing crustal deformation in the northern part of
              southeastern Alaska (latitude 57  to 62).  The target of this investigation is
              a region that is currently experiencing the highest rates of uplift in the
              world (25 to 40 mm/yr) and where relative plate motion is 50 mm/yr. 
              Preliminary results show an interesting and very exciting pattern of uplift and
              tectonic strain accumulation in southeastern Alaska.

A network of 80+
              campaign GPS sites established during a prior study are being re-occupied to
              fill gaps in delineation of the spatial and temporal characteristics of current
              uplift and horizontal crustal deformation, and to improve the precision at most
              of the sites.  Two sites are being examined to determine Little Ice Age and
              post-Little Ice Age uplift history from dendrochronology and geomorphology.
              This additional data will fill gaps in both far-field locations where uplift is
              lowest and in regions where uplift has been greatest, providing better temporal
              and spatial control on decadal and centennial time scales. The results of these
              field investigations are being used to develop two- and three-dimensional
              isostatic rebound models, to analyze plate tectonic deformation, and to
              evaluate the relationship between glaciations and tectonics in the northern
              part of southeast Alaska.
