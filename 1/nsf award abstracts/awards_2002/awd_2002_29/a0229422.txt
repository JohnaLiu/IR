Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Peter Sells will coordinate a
              meeting to plan a variety of activities associated with the eventual
              development of a new initiative within NSF. The long-range goal of these
              activities is to dedicate funding to projects that are developing new
              approaches to linguistic theory and its applications based on data-rich
              foundations. This project is significant for two main reasons: (1) It will
              improve the Linguistics Program's alignment with movements in the scientific
              communities it serves. (2) It will be another way that NSF supports and perhaps
              enhance a field's development of new approaches.
