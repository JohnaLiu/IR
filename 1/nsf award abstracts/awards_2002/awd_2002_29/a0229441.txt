The primary
              focus of this one-year project is to design and develop a model summer
              engineering education institute focusing on integration of engineering content
              with mathematics, science, and technology education that could motivate
              academically qualified high school seniors to seriously consider engineering
              majors in college.  Another objective is The institute model builds teams of
              educators at various levels - teacher educators from mathematics, science and
              technology education; engineering educators; in-service teachers; pre-service
              teachers; undergraduate engineering students; and secondary students - to
              stimulate the inclusion of significant engineering related instructional
              content within the public school curriculum.   The teams will participate in a
              variety of classroom and laboratory-based experiences along with field trips
              and motivational speakers that focus on engineering concepts to illustrate
              real-world applications of mathematics, science, and technology.  Faculty in
              engineering and education and teachers continue to develop engineering enhanced
              instructional materials and strategies to be tested in public schools and the
              university in the months following the institute.
