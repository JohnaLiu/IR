Abstract    :
              The small-scale structural fabric of Earth's inner core and lower mantle is
              important to the understanding of mantle convection, slab cycling, plume
              formation, and solidification of the inner core, including the dynamic
              deformation of the inner core boundary and its relation to the differential
              rotation of the inner core and mantle and the earth's magnetic field. Seismic
              modeling will be performed to image the small-scale (1-1000 km) fabric of the
              inner core and lowermost mantle that are important to these processes. 
              Waveforms of the PKIKP seismic phase will be modeled to determine the depth
              dependence, lateral variation, anisotropy, and frequency dependence of inner
              core visco-elasticity, and crystalline fabric to constrain models of inner core
              solidification. Seismic waveform modeling will also be performed to constrain
              the statistical and deterministic structure of the lowermost mantle, which can
              provide important signatures that can enable a discrimination among the
              proposed origins of the heterogeneous structure in this region: remnant slabs,
              solid-solid phase transitions, pools of primitive mantle, partial melt, and
              core-mantle chemical reactions.
