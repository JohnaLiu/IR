Chemical zoning of minerals in terms of their Fe/(Fe+Mg)
              value can be used to constrain the rates and nature of a variety of geological
              processes, if the rate of Fe-Mg interdiffusion is known for the minerals of
              interest.  The goal of this project is to measure Fe-Mg interdiffusion rates
              for the common minerals orthopyroxene and olivine as a function of temperature
              and oxygen fugacity.  Rutherford backscattering will be used to measure the
              Fe/(Fe+Mg) profiles produced in laboratory experiments.  This will permit very
              short (200 nm) compositional profiles to be measured.  Because of the
              comparatively slow rate of diffusion in orthopyroxene, previous attempts to
              measure Fe-Mg interdiffusion coefficients for orthopyroxene have been
              unsuccessful.  Diffusion in olivine will also be studied because of
              disagreement among published diffusion data sets for olivine and to extend the
              range of measurements to lower temperatures (600-900 degrees C).
