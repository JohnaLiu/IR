Abstract    :
              This project will extend the WINDMI model of magnetospheric substorms.  A new,
              spatially-resolved nonlinear dynamics model of the coupled
              magnetosphere-ionosphere system will be developed.  That coupled system is
              driven by inputs from the solar wind.  The model is derived from Maxwell's
              equations and nonlinear plasma dynamics.  It has numerous feedback and
              feed-forward loops that provide a low-dimensional dynamic system that can
              capture most of the important physical processes that lead to substorms.  The
              method of treating the magnetosphere-ionosphere system as a low-dimensional,
              nonlinear dynamical system is very different from, but complementary to, the
              global scale simulations that are being done by a number of other research
              groups.  The project will examine the differences in the power flow and energy
              releases that give rise to different types of substorms and intensifications. 
              Because the model can be driven by information on the state of the solar wind
              that can be obtained either from observations at the L1 point or from solar
              observations in conjunction with solar-wind modeling, the model has predictive
              capabilities that are useful for space weather forecasting.
