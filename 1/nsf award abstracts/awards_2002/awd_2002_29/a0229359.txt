ABSTRACT

This
              project is designed to study the three-dimensional internal structure of
              phosphatized animal embryos and algae in the Neoproterozoic Doushantuo
              Formation using new microscopic X-radiographic computed tomographic (microCT)
              as well as conventional SEM and thin section techniques. Analyses will focus on
              a well-constrained suite of 15 morphotypes. These fossils provide critical
              information about the evolution of early multicellular organisms, and exhibit
              some of the most spectacular cellular-level preservation known from the
              geologic record. The goals of this project are to characterize the geometry,
              spatial relationships, and number of cells within individual embryos and algae,
              and to identify possible subcellular structures. This information will be used
              to interpret the subcellular biology, cell geometry, and cell division
              topology. Ultimately, such information is important in taxonomic and
              phylogenetic interpretation of these Doushantuo fossils, which provide a unique
              window onto the Neoproterozoic diversification of multicellular eukaryotes.
              Techniques developed during the implementation of this project will be used to
              examine other permineralized and calcareous fossils.
