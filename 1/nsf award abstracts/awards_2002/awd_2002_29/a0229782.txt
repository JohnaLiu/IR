Abstract    :
              TERC and ASTC will collaborate with thirteen science and technology centers
              around the country to create and implement a professional development program
              for science center staff.  The goal of this project is to use exhibits and
              educational programs as a vehicle for building a presence for mathematics in
              science centers nationwide.  The participating science centers will develop
              mathematics initiatives while working with TERC and ASTC to create workshops on
              topics such as data, measurement, algebra, national standards and visitor
              accessibility.  Start-up sites will create training networks in California,
              Florida, Massachusetts, Missouri, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North
              Carolina, Oregon and Texas.  Workshops will be offered on-line and also at
              local and national conferences.  The project will produce a publication
              entitled "Promising Math Practices in Science Centers" that will highlight best
              practices for the incorporation of mathematics into museum programs.  It is
              anticipated that the number of participating institutions will increase to 120
              during the life of the project.
