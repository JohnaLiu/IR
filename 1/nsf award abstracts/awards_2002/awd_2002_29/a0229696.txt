Abstract    :
              Geoff Haines-Stiles Productions is producing and distributing a project that
              will follow the upcoming NASA 2003 Mars Exploration Rover project.   To Mars
              with MER consists of three prime-time PBS programs scheduled to be broadcast to
              coincide with key events in the MER project:  the day before the launch, the
              day before landing and after the 90 day surface mission.   These programs will
              examine such mission milestones as key engineering tests and selecting where to
              land based on the scientific questions we have about Mars.  The prime time
              specials will be edited and, along with additional live and taped video,
              distributed to science centers, planetariums, educational cable networks and
              schools with satellite or high-bandwidth Internet connections.  Passport to
              Knowledge, a partner in the project, will adapt NASA's public domain materials
              and its own Live from Mars resources (teacher's guide, websites, etc.) to
              provide customized resources for teachers and students and for the parents and
              families who will be watching coverage of the mission on broadcast and cable. 
              All materials will be made available online.
