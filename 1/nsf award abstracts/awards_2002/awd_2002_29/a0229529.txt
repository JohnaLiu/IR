Compositional gradients at the rims of partially
              resorbed garnet crystals from Texas and Labrador will be analyzed by electron
              microprobe and laser-ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry. Computer
              simulations of the origin of these stranded diffusion profiles will be used to
              place limits on the relative and absolute rates of intracrystalline diffusion
              of both major elements (Mg, Fe, Mn, Ca) and trace elements (e.g., Y, Yb, Dy,
              Sm, Ce, Nd). The project will enlarge and enrich the existing dataset on
              diffusion in garnet, extending it to the temperatures and pressures relevant to
              crustal metamorphic processes, expanding it to a greater number of elements of
              interest, and broadening it to encompass a wider range of geologically
              important garnet compositions. Applications of the new data are foreseen in the
              areas of geothermobarometry, geochronometry, assessment of heating and cooling
              histories in metamorphic terranes, and quantification of rates  of tectonic
              uplift, among others. During the project, undergraduate and graduate students
              en route to professional scientific careers will acquire state-of-the-art
              analytical skills in electron-probe microanalysis, laser-ablation technology
              and quadrapole mass spectrometry, and high-resolution X-ray computed
              tomography.
