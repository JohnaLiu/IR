Abstract    :
              National Geographic Television requests $1,121,583 (35%) of a total project
              budget of $3,192,249, to  produce a documentary series in 13 half-hour and one
              hour-long special, "Facing the Wild:  The Crittercam Chronicles," with
              associated informal science education materials and programs.  This project
              will feature the natural histories of some of the Earth's most enigmatic and
              charismatic marine species, highlight the groundbreaking technology employed to
              study these extraordinary creatures and celebrate the scientists who devote
              their lives to understanding marine creatures.  The project's goals include: 
              to educate audiences about the vital importance of the world's oceans to the
              health of the planet; to celebrate the ingenuity of novel technology developed
              for science and exploration; to illustrate that many tantalizing mysteries
              remain yet unsolved and a great deal of exciting science and exploration has
              yet to be done; to provide viewers with scientific role models and help
              motivate them to pursue careers in science.  Employing cutting-edge remote
              imaging tools, including "crittercam", and National Geographic's trademark
              storytelling, Facing the Wild's strong conservation message is designed to
              appeal to a national and global audience.  A robust web site, virtual teacher
              workshops and Student Ocean Conferences will augment the impact of the
              series.
