This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration in
              geometry involves Matthew L. Gursky at Indiana University, Paul C. Yang and
              Sung-Yung Chang at Princeton University, Frank Merle and Emmanuel Hebey at the
              University of Cergy-Pontoise.  The collaboration addresses higher order
              elliptic, in particular fourth order, and parabolic equations in geometry and
              mathematical physics.  These geometry problems arise in conformal geometry,
              Einstein manifolds, and canonical metrics.  The US mathematicians bring to this
              collaboration expertise in higher order equations.  This is complemented by
              French expertise in analytical problems.

This award represents the US side
              of joint proposals to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific
              Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for
              individual visits of US investigators and students and group travel to a
              workshop.  The CNRS will support the visits of the French researchers. The
              collaboration will advance fundamental understanding of higher order equations
              as applied to problems in physics, geometry, and analysis.  The project adds an
              international dimension to training of students and provides opportunities to
              develop international partnerships.
