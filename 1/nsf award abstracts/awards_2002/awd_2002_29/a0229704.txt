Seismological investigations yield the most precise
              information on the velocities of sound waves in the Earth's interior. 
              Laboratory measurements of the sound velocities in minerals enable these
              seismic data to be interpreted in terms of chemical composition, mineralogy and
              temperature. This project will utilize ultrasonic techniques in combination
              with synchrotron X-radiation to measure the sound velocities of mantle minerals
              at simultaneous high pressures and temperatures.  This research program takes
              advantage of the special opportunities for research that are provided by the
              multi-anvil, large-volume facilities of the Stony Brook High Pressure
              Laboratory and the associated analytical facilities of the Mineral Physics
              Institute at Stony Brook University.  Many of these facilities were developed
              under the auspices of the NSF Science and Technology Center for High Pressure
              Research (CHiPR) from 1991-2002.
