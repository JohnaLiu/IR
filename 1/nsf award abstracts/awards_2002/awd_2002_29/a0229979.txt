Abstract    :
              The PI has described a new technique for the automated analysis of strain in
              analog
experiments. Using this technique, he propose to test a series of
              published analytical
and numerical models for the behavior of critical wedges,
              both Coulomb and viscous,
focusing upon three broad questions.

These
              questions include:

- the conditions for the formation of a double
              retrowedge,
- the rheological and geometric constraints on the occurrence of
              extension in critical
wedges
- the strain and rotational signatures of a
              suite of proposed mechanisms for the formation
of lobate mountain ranges

In
              this modeling, he will emphasize:
- the testing of specific predictions for
              critical wedge behavior based upon numerical and
analog modeling, and
-
              relating alternative models for the creation of arcuate mountain belts to
              specific
geological observables (finite strains, slip vectors, geodetic strain
              rate patterns,
structural traces) by which models might be discriminated from
              each other.
