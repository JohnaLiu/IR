Hydrogen is perhaps the most poorly constrained
              compositional variable in the Earth, yet it has a controlling effect on many if
              not most geologic processes. This is a proposal to improve the understanding of
              the hydration state of the interior by investigation of the stability, crystal
              chemistry and equation of state of hydrous olivine, spinel, and spinelloid
              phases that would occur in and near a hydrous Transition Zone.  In
              collaboration with colleagues at the Bavarian Geological Institute (Bayerisches
              Geoinstitut), we will perform synthesis experiments on hydrous peridotite
              compositions at temperatures and pressures corresponding to depths of 300 to
              700 km. At the University of Colorado, we will characterize these materials by
              single crystal X-ray diffraction, electron microprobe and IR spectroscopy.  We
              will use single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements in the diamond anvil
              cell (DAC) at the University of Colorado to measure compressibilities
              (isothermal bulk moduli) and thermal expansion of the hydrous olivine, spinel
              and spinelloid phases observed in these experiments. With a single year of
              funding, we expect to be able to complete characterization of a series of
              hydrous ringwoodites, wadsleyites and olivines and to perform high-pressure
              compression experiments on several of these samples. Because the bulk modulus
              is directly related to seismic velocity, if the compressibilities of these
              phases differ greatly from the anhydrous modifications, it may be possible to
              place some constraint on the amount of OH actually present in the minerals of
              the Transition Zone.  In addition, we will continue our collaborative studies
              on measurement of elastic properties by Brillouin spectroscopy and GHz
              ultrasonic interferometry, and make samples available to other groups.
