Hysteresis measurements have become an important part of
              characterizing magnetic behavior of rocks in paleomagnetic studies. 
              Theoretical interpretation is often difficult owing to the complexity of
              mineral magnetism and published data sets demonstrate remanence and coercivity 
              behavior that is currently unexplained.  In the last decade numerical
              micromagnetic modelling has been used to simulate magnetic
particles. Such
              simulations reveal the existence of non-uniform remanent states between single
              and multi-domain,  known as the "flower'' and "vortex'' configurations.  These
              suggest plausible explanations for many hysteresis measurements yet fall short
              of explaining high saturation remanence, high coercivity data such as those
              commonly observed in fine grained submarine basalts.    Micromagnetic modelling
              promises to provide  plausible explanations for a wide range of hysteresis
              behavior.  The investigators  propose to extend their  numerical simulations to
              a  greater variety of shapes and sizes, including random assemblages of
              particles and shapes more complex than simple rods and cubes.   They also will 
              explore the parameter space of important magnetic materials other than room
              temperature magnetite.   Finally, they will incorporate thermal fluctuations
              into their numerical code and expand the scope of  modelling efforts to include
              this very important effect.
