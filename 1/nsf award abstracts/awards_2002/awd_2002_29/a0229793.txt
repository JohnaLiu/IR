Abstract

This project
              is a collaborative effort bridging the gap between modern datasets and modern
              modeling techniques, in an effort to improve our ability to elucidate
              rheological structure within active tectonic zones.  In particular, we will
              characterize the sensitivity of our estimates of lithospheric rheology to the
              spatial and temporal scale of available datasets.  We emphasize the role of
              model cycle-up/spin-up, variable earthquake repeat times, and realistic
              variations in rheology.  This effort will allow for the more effective use
              InSAR and GPS data, to constrain geologically reasonable models. We will apply
              the lessons we learn through theoretical studies to specific, well-constrained
              study areas, including postseismic deformation following the Landers and Hector
              Mine earthquakes and post-rifting deformation in the Northern Volcanic Zone,
              Iceland.  The results and procedures developed during the course of this
              proposal will 1) help to minimize uncertainties associated with improper and/or
              geologically implausible modeling techniques, 2) allow quantitative comparison
              of rheological structures inferred by independent investigators, and 3)
              ultimately lead to more accurate estimates of rheological properties at depth,
              including associated uncertainties.  These inferences can then be used in
              subsequent secondary analyses, particularly those that would benefit from an
              explicit assessment of model and data induced uncertainties, such as studies of
              fault interaction, estimation of fault slip-rates from geodetic data for
              seismic hazard purposes, and time-dependent probabilistic seismic hazard
              assessments.
