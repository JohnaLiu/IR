Several recent studies have shown indications of continued
              ice-sheet thinning in West Antarctica.  Geological evidence of much
              larger-scale deglaciation in the past is therefore a cause for concern over the
              future of the ice sheet.  This award supports an exposure-dating study that
              will help to determine the frequency, extent and duration of previous
              deglaciations, and show whether the present state of West Antarctic ice cover
              is typical, or highly unusual.  The project is based on measurements of
              cosmic-ray-produced nuclides, which accumulate only when rock surfaces are
              exposed above the ice sheet.  Provided these surfaces are protected during
              glaciation by non-erosive, cold-based ice, nuclide concentrations build up to
              record the cumulative history of exposure and ice cover. Although this method
              cannot be used to date specific prior glaciations, it can be used to obtain
              minimum limits on the total duration of past exposure and glaciation, and
              maximum limits on exposure within the late Quaternary (approximately the past
              million years). As an example of this, trial Al-26/Be-10 measurements on a
              sample of bedrock from Marie Byrd Land reveal a history extending back to the
              Pliocene, in which the sampled surface has experienced very limited exposure.
              The results indicate a cumulative exposure time of ~130,000 years, in 3.5
              million years of (non-erosive) ice cover, and limit the total exposure time in
              the past million years to less than ~10,000 years. Evidently this particular
              surface seldom outcrops, suggesting that the current state of deglaciation in
              Marie Byrd Land is unusual compared to most interglacial periods in the late
              Quaternary. This project will explore this possibility with further, coupled
              Be-10/Al-26 analyses of bedrock samples collected during the 2000-01 field
              season. If consistent results emerge, like those described above, scientists
              will be able to constrain: (i) the long-term average configuration of the ice
              sheet in this region, (ii) how much of the current terrain is typically exposed
              during interglacial periods, (iii) the comparative frequency and duration of
              deglaciation in the early Quaternary vs the late Quaternary, and (iv) the
              duration of late-Quaternary deglaciation events, which may be linked to
              previous episodes of extensive deglaciation reported in the literature.
