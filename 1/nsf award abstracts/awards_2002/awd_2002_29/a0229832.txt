High-resolution hypocenter locations are most
              crucial in estimating seismic
hazard, inferring Earth structure, studying
              tectonics, and to the fundamental
understanding of the occurrence and physics
              of earthquakes. Several recent
studies, of which this is a continuation, have
              demonstrated the substantial
improvement in earthquake locations by applying a
              recently developed
double-difference (DD) earthquake relocation algorithm to
              thousands of shallow
earthquakes recorded at local distances. This project
              focuses on 
adapting the DD method to relocate, on a massive scale (several
              tens of thousands of 
events) and over large distances (thousands of km),
              earthquakes recorded at regional and
teleseismic distances. The investigators
              will test and evaluate the 
performance of the new tools using globally
              recorded events for which ground truth is known, and
compare the results with
              results derived from commonly used location 
techniques.

They will also
              apply the DD method to the 'groomed' ISC bulletin to 
relocate large numbers
              of earthquakes in subduction zones with the aim to image the
              internal
structure of seismicity associated with descending slabs. The focus
              will
initially be on the Andean subduction zone with the aim to define in
              detail the
morphology of the slab and its correlation with patterns of
              microseismicity and
the rupture areas of damaging earthquakes. they will also
              relocate other areas
with dense seismicity to search for characteristic
              seismicity patterns in time
and space which may provide new insights into the
              occurrence and physics of
Wadati Benioff earthquakes.
