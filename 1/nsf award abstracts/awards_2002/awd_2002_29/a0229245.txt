Abstract    :
              A 'horizontal ice core' was collected at the Mount Moulton blue ice field in
              West Antarctica and preliminary analyses of the sample material suggests that a
              ~500 kyr climate record is preserved in the ice at this site. This award will
              contribute to the understanding of the Mt Moulton record by assessing the
              potential for ice-flow induced deformation of the stratigraphic profile. In
              addition, this award builds on the recognition of blue ice areas as archives of
              long climate records by conducting reconnaissance studies for a potential
              horizontal ice core location at the Allan Hills in East Antarctica. The
              objectives of this project are to contribute to the glaciological understanding
              of blue ice areas in Antarctica.  Ice flow conditions at the Mt Moulton blue
              ice field will be studied to assess the possibility that the stratigraphic
              record has been deformed and reconnaissance of a potential horizontal ice core
              site in the Allan Hills blue ice field will also be accomplished. Short field
              programs will be undertaken at each location to collect relevant measurements
              of ice flow and subglacial topography, and to conduct sampling of material that
              will enable the preservation of the stratigraphic sequences to be assessed.
