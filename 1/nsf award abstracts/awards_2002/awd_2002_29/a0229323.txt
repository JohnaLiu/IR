The increasing availability of large numbers of
              high-quality digital records from the global seismic networks has made possible
              a variety of new ways to study deep Earth structure.  By analyzing hundreds or
              thousands of seismograms, it is often possible to resolve new features in the
              data, or to perform more comprehensive analyses of problems that were
              previously addressed on smaller scales.   This project will continue and extend
              analyses of global seismic data at U.C. San Diego to address a variety of
              geophysical issues.  These include:  (1) Resolution of seismic discontinuities
              in the upper mantle using reflected and converted seismic phases,  (2)
              Integrated inversions for discontinuity topography and three-dimensional
              seismic velocity variations in the mantle, (3) Analyses of both compressional
              and shear waves to resolve details of mantle attenuation structure, (4) A
              search for hypothesized mid-mantle discontinuities that may separate the mantle
              into different convecting cells, (5) Study and modeling of high-frequency waves
              scattered from small-scale mantle structure, and (6) Development and
              application of waveform cross-correlation and cluster analysis techniques to
              long-period waveforms.  This research is likely to lead to improved methods for
              seismic data analysis and new constraints on deep Earth structure, composition
              and evolution.  The bulk of the funding will provide graduate student and
              postdoc support that will further education in the Earth Sciences.
