Abstract    :
              WGBH Educational Foundation is requesting $1,261,934, or 33% of a total project
              budget of $3,835,236, to produce 20 new shows and new outreach and Web
              activities for" ZOOM."  Targeted to kids ages 8 to 11, "ZOOM" is a daily,
              half-hour PBS series featuring an assortment of games, riddles, investigations,
              recipes and poems -- all based on materials sent in by its young viewers. 
              Uniquely by and for kids," ZOOM" gives its viewers a chance to explore,
              experiment and share their creativity.  "ZOOM's" science and math segments (30%
              of each half-hour show) give kids opportunities to explore scientific and
              mathematical ideas, concepts and phenomena.  The goals for Season VI are to: 
              (1) expand "ZOOM's" engineering curriculum; (2) develop two new content
              areas--Sports Science, and Perception and Sensation; (3) create new
              partnerships with FIRST LEGO League and Girl Scouts of USA; and, (4) conduct
              summative evaluation to continue to gauge "ZOOM's" effectiveness at teaching
              math and science to targeted audiences.  Outreach for the project will include
              print materials for kids, families and educators.  "ZOOM"-related activities at
              community-based organization include 590 ClubZOOM science afterschool programs
              and 21 ZOOMzone science museum exhibits.  The 2,400-page interactive web site
              is updated weekly.  "ZOOM" currently is carried by 170 public broadcasting
              stations and is viewed by close to 6 million children per week.  The program
              receives 24,000 letters and e-mails per week; the web site attracts an average
              of 14,000 visitors per month.
