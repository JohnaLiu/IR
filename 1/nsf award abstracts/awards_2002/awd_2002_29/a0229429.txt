Abstract    :
              This proposal is a synthesis and integration study of the pan-Arctic water
              cycle. An Expanded Arctic Regional Integrated Monitoring System (E-RIMS) will
              be developed that links an existing, operational hydrological monitoring system
              for the pan-Arctic landmass and atmosphere (Arctic-RIMS) to an Arctic Ocean and
              sea ice component. On the terrestrial side, E-RIMS will produce time varying
              aerological and land surface water budgets including river and ice melt inputs
              to the Arctic Ocean. For the ocean, freshwater fluxes from the atmosphere and
              land will be used in concert with observed mass, heat and momentum forcing to
              drive a coupled ocean-sea ice-atmosphere model.  The linked models will be used
              to examine the origin of freshwater fluxes in the atmosphere and landmass and
              how water is then partitioned between solid (sea ice) and liquid forms in the
              ocean. E-RIMS will also track freshwater transport off the shelf, downward
              below the mixed layer, and laterally toward the straits leading to the North
              Atlantic Ocean. 
  
The near real-time monitoring program and historical
              analysis (from 1960) provides an important benchmark for understanding future
              change to the arctic hydrologic cycle. In keeping with current Arctic-RIMS
              protocols, provisional data sets (ca. 1-2 month delay) will be made available
              and then re-analyzed at yearly intervals for improved quality assurance. All
              key elements of the terrestrial and ocean water balance will be provided,
              including an assessment of potential error. Operational data sets will be
              freely accessible on partner institution web sites and through NSIDC.
              

E-RIMS will complement efforts by other investigators using more fully
              coupled air-land-ocean models, by providing to them initial and boundary
              conditions and by carrying-out a set of preliminary numerical experiments to
              help design their more computationally expensive feedback studies. As a final
              part of this work, NWP predictions and medium-term forecasts will be used to
              explore how much skill will have been developed over the course of this
              study.
