Title: Conference on Functional Data
              Analysis

The Department of Statistics at the University of Florida hosts its
              Fifth Annual Winter Workshop on January 10-11, 2003 in Gainesville, Florida.
              The workshop focuses on recent developments in functional data analysis (FDA),
              which is emerging as one of the most important new statistical methodologies
              with diverse applications in all areas of statistics ranging from image
              analysis to bioinformatics. The workshop provides a forum for interaction
              between theoretical developments and advances in applications of FDA methods.
              Besides the impact on development of human resources, the workshop will
              generate an impetus for the wider dissemination and use of functional data
              analysis techniques. In addition to invited sessions, the conference will
              include a contributed poster session.
