Abstract    :
              The Computer Society of the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers
              (IEEE) and the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) are jointly developing
              new curricular guidelines for undergraduate programs in computing. This project
              is convening various working groups associated with the software engineering
              curricular development effort, to share their findings, to finalize their
              recommendations, and to complete work on a special volume, "Computing Curricula
              Software Engineering (CCSE). This is one of five volumes being produced by a
              joint task force of the Educational Activities Board of the IEEE Computer
              Society and the ACM Education Board.
