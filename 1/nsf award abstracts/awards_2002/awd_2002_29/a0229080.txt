Abstract    :
              Timbuktu Academy has succeeded in designing a program that has raised their
              education focus to an applied level, and directly addressed some of the issues
              that lead to minority underrepresentation in science, mathematics and
              engineering. The program achieves this through an alternative approach to
              mentoring, such that minority students can successfully complete their
              undergraduate education. To do this, the Timbuktu Academy has brought together
              all the key elements that make the program a success at the Southern University
              and A&M College in Baton Rouge. And while the philosophical approach of the
              program may be different, a subset of the student population responds extremely
              well to such mentoring activities.

The achievement of the Timbuktu Academy
              underscores that, while the leaders have taken a unique approach to science
              education, the technique has been spectacularly successful.
