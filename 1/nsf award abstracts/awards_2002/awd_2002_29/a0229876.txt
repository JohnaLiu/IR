A first-order characterization of the
              seismogenic zone, including its geometry 
and up and down-dip limits is nearly
              established in northern and central Costa 
Rica. This was accomplished through
              the deployment of two onshore/offshore 
seismic networks directly above the
              seismogenic zone that were part of a 
MARGIN's funded multidisciplinary
              seismogenic zone experiment (CRSEIZE). This 
proposal seeks to: 1) use data
              collected during this experiment in conjunction 
with local network data to
              establish a similar first-order characterization of 
the seismogenic zone in
              Nicaragua; 2) perform a detailed investigation of the 
variations in the
              transition from inter to intra plate seismicity in northern 
Costa Rica and
              Nicaragua; and 3) evaluate thermal and mechanical models that 
have been
              proposed to control this transition.  These golas will be accomplished 
by
              simultaneously inverting local travel time data in northern Costa Rica and
              
Nicaragua to obtain an high resolution, three-dimensional, P and S wave
              velocity 
structure and accurate hypocentral locations. Earthquake locations
              coupled with 
focal mechanism determinations will allow the active seimogenic
              zone to be 
identified in southern Nicaragua, where the addition of stations
              from the 
northern Costa Rica (Nicoya) network greatly improves station
              coverage and 
hypocentral accuracy.
