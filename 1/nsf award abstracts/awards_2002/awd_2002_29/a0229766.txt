Abstract    :
              The proposed research will assess the response of soil thermal, freeze-thaw and
              permafrost dynamics to climate change, and will evaluate the impacts of these
              processes on the hydrologic cycle of the Russian arctic drainage basin over the
              past half century.  Research methods will include analysis and synthesis of
              data acquired (in many cases, rescued) from 400 locations distributed
              throughout the former Soviet Union.  A key question being addressed focusses on
              explaining the large observed geographical irregularity in long-term surface
              temperature change.  The research is structured to investigate a key hypothesis
              that relates climate warming, higher permafrost temperature, a deeper active
              layer, and a longer thaw season.  One result will be the impact of climate
              warming, through the soil and permafrost interactions, on the seasonal cycles
              of riverine fresh water input to the Arctic Ocean.  The project will also yield
              a series of data products relevant to soil temperature and freeze-thaw cycles.
