This is a five-year proposal submitted by Dr. Hung Tao Shen,
              Clarkson University, to support continual funding for the REU site on Marine
              Science and Engineering, in collaboration with Ocean University of Qingdao and
              Dalian University of Technology in China.   The East Asia and Pacific Program
              first funded this REU site program in China in 2000.  This program has been
              well received by student participants.  Many participants indicated that this
              program has contributed to their selection of marine science or engineering as
              a career.

This is an important part of activities to encourage American
              Workforce and Research and Education (AWARE) Experience in East Asia.  This
              program has enabled U.S. students to gain research experience and interest in
              China, and developed their capabilities to participate in international
              scientific and engineering activities.  This program also enable the Chinese
              participants, including mentors, graduate students, and undergraduates, to gain
              the experience of working with future U.S. scientists and engineers.  The
              results of this program can enhance our mutual understanding of research
              environments and educational systems, and improve science teaching and learning
              in the U.S. and China.
