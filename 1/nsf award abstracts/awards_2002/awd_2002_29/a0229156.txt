Abstract    :
              We are developing  open-ended computer simulations of protein
              laboratory
procedures for case-based learning in international biology
              curricula. We are distributing
these simulations freely via Internet download
              so that they are available to university and
high school students worldwide.
              Existing protein software applications lack the ability to
produce realistic,
              easily understandable output for procedures such as enzyme
immunoassays,
              hemagglutination inhibition, immunofluorescence, protein
electrophoresis, and
              western blotting. Such procedures are especially useful for the
analysis of
              cases involving infectious diseases of humans and domestic animals
              including
anthrax, foot-and-mouth disease, influenza, HIV infection,
              hantavirus, encephalitis, Lyme
disease, genital herpes, hepatitis, brucellosis
              and rinderpest, among many others. They
provide a vehicle for making topics in
              molecular biology more interesting and relevant to
students, particularly
              female non-science majors. Protein simulations complement
DNA simulations we
              have previously developed and freely distributed for the analysis of
              cases
based primarily on human genetic diseases. The proposed simulations have
              wide
applicability because they can be adapted to any protein-based case
              scenario. Students
can participate in Internet "poster sessions" via an online
              integrated web editor /
conferencing system we developed with prior NSF
              support.

Pre-service science teachers are being used as research assistants
              for assessment, and results
are being widely disseminated via presentations,
              workshops, and publications including the
BioQUEST Library. The BioQUEST
              Curriculum Consortium strongly supports this
proposal and is assisting in the
              evaluation and dissemination of project results.
