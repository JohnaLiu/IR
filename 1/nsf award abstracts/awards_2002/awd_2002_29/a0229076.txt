This project, entitled "Teaching and Learning
              Anthropology: Using Scalable Digital Library Platforms and Innovations in
              Approaches to Content" is a collaborative effort of Columbia University and the
              London School of Economics, UK.   Starting from a focus on concrete learning
              outcomes, the primary aim will be to develop a series of digital tools,
              methods, and approaches with the potential to change the teaching and learning
              of anthropology. Once the investigators have developed a series of teaching
              methods and tools, they will then embed them in a digital learning environment
              for wider use. This environment will comprise a stable, flexible, and scalable
              digital library infrastructure, and it will allow for customized use across a
              wide range of academic fields . The project results will be made available on
              an "open source" basis, for use in diverse cultural, technological, and
              educational settings at the undergraduate level.
