Abstract    :
              The proposed research will assess the interannual variability of Arctic Ocean
              landfast ice and its long-term contribution to the Arctic freshwater budget. 
              Goals are to examine variability for the entire Arctic Basin, investigate
              spatial and temporal changes in fast ice growth, melt and brine fluxes, and
              analyze long-term ice volume change in terms of freshwater storage and in
              response to climate-scale variation in precipitation, surface air temperatures,
              winds and river discharge.  The research approach will be to combine a 26-year
              landfast ice record, available from ice charts recently released by the
              National Ice Center, with a 1-D thermodynamic model. The work will emphasize a
              time series approach focussed on decadal change associated with the Arctic
              Oscillation and spatial variation among different sub-regions within the
              Arctic.  Results on interannual variations in landfast ice will benefit both
              other investigators of the Arctic Freshwater Cycle and populations dwelling
              adjacent to Arctic water bodies.
