              Virtual Ecology: Experimental Tests of Evolution in Predator-Prey
              Systems

Some of the most profound issues in biological
              evolution concern the selective effects of interactions between organisms,
              particularly the influence of predators on the color patterning of their prey. 
              The proposed research will study the effects of predation using a 'virtual
              ecology', in which predators hunt moth-like virtual prey whose appearance is
              controlled by a computer-based genetic algorithm.  When the prey are detected
              on the computer screen, they are considered to have been eaten.  Only surviving
              prey can breed to produce the next generation, so the actions of the predator,
              over time, influence the appearance of the virtual prey dynamically, causing it
              to evolve into new forms.  This procedure will be used to test hypotheses that
              relate prey appearance to patterns of predation.  For example, most palatable
              prey are also cryptically colored, difficult to detect, and highly variable in
              appearance.  In contrast, prey that are poisonous or distasteful tend to be
              conspicuously colored and to vary little in appearance.  By establishing
              populations of virtual moths that vary in coloration and palatability, several
              hypotheses that have been proposed to account for differences in appearance and
              variability of the prey will be rigorously tested.  The proposed research will
              advance our understanding of the complex dynamics involved in predator-prey
              interactions over evolutionary time.  It will also establish the validity of
              virtual ecology for studying complex evolutionary dynamics, potentially adding
              powerful new techniques to the scientific study of ecological relationships
              among
              organisms.
