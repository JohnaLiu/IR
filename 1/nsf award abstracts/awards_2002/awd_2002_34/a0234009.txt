"A Thermomechanical Framework for
              the Analysis of Soil Liquefaction "

This action supports a new approach to
              modeling the phenomenon of soil liquefaction due to earthquake
              excitation.

The liquefaction of saturated cohesionless soils involves a
              change in soil behavior from solid-like to fluid-like.  The new approach
              involves the application of a general thermodynamic framework that has been
              quite successful in describing very diverse dissipative processes.  This
              thermodynamic framework is particularly suited to describing the inelastic
              response of materials, and is very appropriate for describing the transition
              from solid-like to fluid-like behavior.  It has been used to describe both
              solid-to-solid and liquid-to-solid phase transitions, as well as plasticity and
              viscoelasticity.  In applying this framework to soil liquefaction, the soil is
              modeled as a mixture of a granular material and a liquid, capable of undergoing
              large reversible and irreversible deformations.

After the framework has been
              developed to describe soil liquefaction, specific initial-boundary value
              problems of soil liquefaction will be studied.
