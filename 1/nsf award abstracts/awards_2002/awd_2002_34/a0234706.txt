Abstract    :
              This project involves the study of methyl bromide (CH3Br) and methyl chloride
              (CH3Cl) from fungi in several environments including temperate forest,
              salt-marsh, fresh-water wetland, and agricultural ecosystems.  Several types of
              common fungi will be isolated from soil and coarse woody debris, grown in the
              laboratory and their ability to produce methyl halide investigated, and also
              re-introduced into sterilized 'natural' soils to determine methyl halide
              production rates in the natural environment.  The effect of soil temperature
              and moisture levels on the production rates will be studied.

Methyl bromide
              and methyl chloride are important atmospheric halides because they can affect
              tropospheric and stratospheric ozone chemistry.  Their atmospheric budgets are
              not well understood.
