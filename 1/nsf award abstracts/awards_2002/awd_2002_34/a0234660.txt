Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Barnard College will acquire a
              gas chromatograph mass spectrometer  with flame ionization detector
              (GC/MS/FID). This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including a) studies of contaminant concentrations and metabolite formation in
              laboratory bacterial and protozoan cultures; b) analysis of components of
              biologically-produced organic matter; c) analysis of product distributions of
              intermolecular reactions of dihalocarbenes with strained olefins; and d)
              kinetic studies of N-heterocyclic carbenes.  
Gas chromatograph with mass
              spectrometric detection (GCMS) is an extremely powerful technique used for the
              separation and analysis of complex mixtures. This instrument will substantially
              strengthen scientific research in environmental and organic chemistry at
              Barnard College.
