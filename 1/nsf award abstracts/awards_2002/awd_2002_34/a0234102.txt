Abstract 

A NIH-NSF BBSI Summer
              Institute in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (SIBCB) is planned at
              Iowa State University (ISU). The faculty are 10 principal scientists with
              diverse areas of expertise, from computer science, mathematics, statistics,
              genomics, informatics, biophysics and structural biology. Summaries of recent
              accomplishments in genomics, methods in bioinformatics and computational
              biology, and applications to genetics and molecular biology will be presented
              in a two week intensive instructional course, including programming instruction
              and computer laboratory sessions. The participants will be 15 students
              supported by this grant and an additional group of 11 students from industrial
              laboratories plus two high school teachers, who will broaden the experience for
              the core students and provide additional funds to enhance the course. Following
              the course, the 15 NIH-NSF supported students will select among research
              projects and spend eight weeks developing their own research projects; thus the
              SIBCB will last 10 weeks. These projects will span the range from sequence
              analysis to comparative genomics to protein homology modeling to simulations of
              organism growth. An organized "job fair" will include presentations by the
              faculty. Immediately before embarking on their research projects, the students
              will receive an introduction to Bioethics. The research period will present the
              students with tools to comprehend
and begin significant research projects with
              a broad, integrated approach to complex biology.
