This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) award
              supports Randy Duran, Anne Donnelly, Timothy Morey, and a student from
              University of Florida in a collaboration with Wolfgang Knoll, Stefan Schiller,
              and Christiane Thielemann of the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in
              Mainz, Germany.  Together, the two groups will perform experiments in support
              of eventual drug detoxification applications.  The experiments will involve the
              ability of engineered core/shell nanoparticles to detoxify ex vivo cardiac
              myocyte cells cultured on microelectrode array supports.  The nanoparticles
              will be used to reduce drug concentrations in cardiac cells.  The collaboration
              will also attempt to form model membranes containing the drug-active ion
              channels themselves as they perform electrochemical experiments with drug
              detoxification systems.  The collaboration establishes a connection between the
              NSF-funded Engineering Research Center at the University of Florida and the Max
              Planck Insititute in Germany.  The experiments have the potential to provide
              the first example of detoxification applications with cell-based biosensors and
              will facilitate a broad range of related studies involving core/shell
              nonoparticle research.  As part of the collaboration, a University of Florida
              graduate student will spend six months doing research in the lab in Mainz.
