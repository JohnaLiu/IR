Abstract    :
              This project focuses on instrumentation of parallel and distributed systems,
              integrated tool environments, and performance modeling of application-specific
              systems from high-level specification.  The objects of the research include: 
              Develop an integrated environment based on an instrumentation system (IS), so
              that a user may navigate among multiple performance tools to support analysis
              and diagnosis strategies; apply a structured approach for IS design and
              evaluation (P'RISM: PaRallel Instrumentation System Management) to develop new
              ISs according to system requirements and to provide feedback to other IS
              developers;  select metrics for evaluating IS performance; develop a software
              architecture for scalable ISs and identify requisite technologies.  Three
              primary activities support these objectives: (1) apply service request outcome
              analysis to derive a set of metrics for evaluating IS performance and further
              qualify those metrics that may be used for comparing performance of different
              ISs: (2) in coordination with the Paradyn project and the Parallel Tools Team
              at the Cornell Theory Center, complete a full IS performance evaluation study
              using analytical modeling, simulation, and measurement techniques; and (3)
              using P'RISM, develop the software architecture of an IS and develop a
              prototype based on this specification.
