Digital Government:
              Bringing Government and Citizens Together: A Metadata Extension Test-bed for
              the Kentucky Spatial Data Infrastructure (KYSDI) Clearinghouse.

The planning
              grant will enable us to undertake research on developing a Metadata extension
              for spatial data integration involving citizens and government.  We propose to
              focus on establishing the parameters for improving citizen involvement in the
              project and developing a prototype application to assess technical issues. 
              These activities will be the basis for emphasizing four key themes: semantic
              interoperability, human-computer interaction, inter-agency collaboration, and
              citizen access in a revised submission to the digital government program.
