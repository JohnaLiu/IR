Abstract    :
              An existing web-based statistical cluster analysis tool, WLV (Web LOICZview)
              will be modified to make it possible to track changes in environmental systems
              through time.  This will permit the analysis of spatio-temporal data and
              multidimensional datasets, including multivariable outputs of 3-D simulations
              of environmental models.  WLV has a proven track record for analyzing and
              categorizing georeferenced environmental data.  This application to
              time-varying data is a logical extension, although not without effort and some
              risk.  A proof-of-principle analysis will include spatiotemporal simulations of
              nitrogen dynamics in an explicit model of forest nitrogen dynamics.  The work
              is collaboration among Cornell, Swarthmore and the University of Kansas.
