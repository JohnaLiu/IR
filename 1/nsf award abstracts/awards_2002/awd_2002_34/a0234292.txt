This research plans to explore a highly innovative technique
              for preparing endohedral metallofullerenes. Empty cage fullerenes, such as C60
              and C70, and endohedral metallofullerenes are most commonly prepared in a
              Kratschmer-Huffman electric-arc generator by high temperature vaporization
              (3000-5000 K) of graphite rods packed with metals and/or metal oxides. The
              typical endohedral metallofullerenes, such as Ax@C2y (x= 1-3, y=30-50) have
              been reported with encapsulated metal and non-metal atoms, but are typically
              formed in low yields (< 0.5 %) with multiple isomers of low symmetry. The PI's
              research group has recently reported the first class of stable endohedral
              metallofullerenes, A3-xBxN@C2y (x=0-3, A,B=metal, y=34, 39, 40), e.g.,
              Sc3N@C80, formed by a trimetallic nitride template (TNT) process in
              significantly improved yields. For example, the archetypal Sc3N@C80 is stable
              in air to temperatures of 600-650 K or in nanotube "peapods" in vacuo to
              temperatures in excess of 1300 K. The discovery of a more rational synthesis
              for the preparation of the trimetallic nitride template (TNT) endohedral
              metallofullerenes at lower temperatures would open new vistas for these unique
              materials in a wide range of electronic, optoelectronic, magnetic, catalytic,
              nanomechanical, and medical applications.

The high stability of the TNT
              endohedral metallofullerenes suggests new avenues toward a more rational
              synthesis of these unique materials. The recent success in preparing C60 by
              pyrolysis of precursor hydrocarbons at lower temperatures is an example of this
              strategy. This success, coupled with the declining cost of empty-cage C60,
              suggests the possibility of using this prominent fullerene, C60 as a precursor
              for endohedral metallofullerenes. Preliminary chromatographic retention time
              and mass spectrometry data clearly identify the TNT endohedral metallofullerene
              Sc3N@C80 as a major product of this new lower temperature synthesis. Several
              other empty-cages are also produced  C70 and C84 as well as several new
              endohedral metallofullerenes. These results are extraordinary, although much
              fundamental research is critically needed to exploit the potential for
              preparing these TNT endohedral metallofullerenes in large-scale quantities. The
              specific aims of this study are to: optimize operating parameters of the quartz
              tube batch reactor for high yield, lower temperature production of TNT
              endohedral metallofullerenes such as Sc3N@C80; isolate and characterize new
              endohedral metallofullerenes; elucidate the mechanism(s) and key intermediates
              involved in this lower temperature reaction utilizing isotopic tracers (15 N
              and 13 C); and construct a continuous reactor for enhanced production of the
              TNT endohedral metallofullerenes.
