Abstract    :
              F. Rob Jackson, Ph.D.	(Proposal 0234724)	"Circadian control of locomotor
              activity"

	In all animal species, including humans, many different
              biological processes (e.g., sleep or general activity) show 24-h rhythms and
              are controlled by an endogenous circadian clock, located in the brain. In the
              present proposal the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is being used as a
              genetic model to study the factors that act downstream of the clock cells (in
              the brain) to effect the expression of rhythmic processes. One of those factors
              is called Ebony and is the subject of this application. The ebony gene is
              expressed according to a circadian rhythm and ebony mutants show altered
              activity rhythms. The purpose of the present work is to determine where (in
              which cells) the ebony gene acts in the nervous system and to study how those
              cells control activity rhythms. The advantage of this research approach in
              Drosophila is the use of genetic techniques to examine the cell biology and
              biochemistry underlying complex behavioral processes. As many of the factors
              comprising circadian clock systems are conserved between Drosophila and
              mammalian species (e.g., humans), the proposed work may help elucidate the
              clock control of rhythmic processes in other species.
