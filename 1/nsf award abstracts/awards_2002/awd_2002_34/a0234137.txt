Abstract    :
              This project aims to better understand the genes and molecular processes
              necessary for adaptation to high salinities in the halophilic, or
              irsalt-lovinglo microbe, Haloferax volcanii. The extreme halophiles belonging
              to the domain Archaea require salt concentrations for growth that range from
              ~1.5 M up to 5.2 M NaCl, an upper limit in excess of ten times the salinity of
              seawater. Halophiles are found in such hostile environments as the Dead Sea and
              the Great Salt Lake, where high concentrations of salt preclude the growth of
              almost all other known organisms. H. volcanii is a model organism for studying
              the effects of changes in environmental salinity on gene expression, as this
              organism grows over a wide range of salt concentrations, between approximately
              12% to 30% NaCl. Previous funding by the NSF supported exploratory research to
              both isolate H. volcanii salt-sensitive mutants and begin preliminary research
              to characterize genes involved in hypersaline regulation using molecular
              approaches. This project will continue to build upon previous findings to
              perform more in-depth analyses. The major objectives of this research are to:
              1) identify genes involved in causing the salt-sensitive phenotype of the H.
              volcanii mutant strains; 2) begin examining the regulatory elements involved in
              controlling salinity-mediated gene regulation; and 3) characterize and identify
              the targets of a putative regulatory gene found to be expressed under high salt
              growth conditions. The broader impacts of this project will both advance
              discovery through undergraduate teaching and training and broaden the exposure
              to science of underrepresented minorities. It is anticipated that all of the
              students who participate in this research will gain valuable experience in the
              study of molecular biology, microbiology, and genetics that in turn will better
              prepare them for future careers in science.
