Abstract    :
              Summary:  This research explores the potential links between the east Asian
              monsoon and the North Atlantic Ocean through atmospheric teleconnections as
              revealed by analyses of climate records in the Late Holocene of ODP Site 1144
              in the South China Sea.  The research will use total faunal census data of
              planktic foraminifer assemblages and isotopic and trace element analyses (Mg/Ca
              ratios) in surface dwelling and thermocline indicator species to determine sea
              surface temperature variations, surface salinity variation, and thermocline
              structure.   The results will be used to test the hypothesis that
              quasi-periodic cold events identified in subpolar and subtropical North
              Atlantic Ocean Holocene records are present in Holocene records from the South
              China Sea.
