Abstract    :
              The research places dependability analysis in a formal, software engineering
              process. This process is integrated with the analysis phase, when analysts and
              domain experts are interacting to
formalize models of the artifact,
              environment and requirements of the  system.  The research focuses on building
              accurate, useful, robust models of the environment. The general approach is to
              look to existing modeling methodologies that center on exploring the
              environment. Those that show promise, e.g., the strand space methodology used
              in security models, will be retooled and integrated into the HDCP/MDS
              testbed.

The research also focuses on the environmental assumptions that are
              made during modeling as a basis for dependability of the deployed system. The
              research explores the link between assumptions made at analysis time, i.e., the
              assumptions made about the environment for the system to function correctly,
              and the actual environment behavior seen at run time (or testing/simulation
              time).

The evaluation of the research will be conducted on a series of
              projects taken from the HDCP/MDS testbed. Each project will be selected to
              highlight a separate modeling issue of the environment.
