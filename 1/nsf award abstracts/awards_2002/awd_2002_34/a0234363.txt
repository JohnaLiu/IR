Abstract    :
              The purpose of the proposed project is developing novel fault-tolerance
              techniques which exploit the synergy between the host and network processors in
              high-speed networked systems, and providing
tools for their validation and the
              assessment of their effectiveness.

Our project will include the following
              tasks:

* Construct a layered architecture with a symbiotic relationship
              
between the network and host processors so that fault tolerance
is
              provided.

* Develop expanded fault injection capabilities in order
to study
              and fully understand the fault propagation and detection
process in a network
              architecture.

* Develop a tool for validating our fault detection and
              recovery 
policies and evaluate their effectiveness in a networked system
              using
both traditional and specially constructed dependability measures. 
              

* Integrate our fault tolerance layer and the evaluation and
validation
              tool into the NASA testbed. 

This project will deliver techniques to better
              utilize the resources of modern network architectures for fault detection and
              recovery.  Such techniques are crucial in space missions, which are
              characterized
by the need for a proper management of computational and
              networking resources for missions lasting years in severely
              resource-constrained applications.
