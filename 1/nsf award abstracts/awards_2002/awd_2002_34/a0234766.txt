This research project, in the
              laboratory of Professor Bruce Doak in the Department of Physics at Arizona
              State University, examines the reactivity of metastable molecular nitrogen in
              the growth of nitride semiconductor thin films.  With the support of the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, fundamental studies of the reaction
              of excited molecular nitrogen species to form nitride and oxynitride thin films
              are being carried out.  A combination of in situ and ex situ methods are used
              to characterize the films prepared using the novel supersonic metastable
              nitrogen beam source developed for these studies.  The fundamental information
              obtained from this work is relevant to the development of processing protocols
              for electronic materials preparation. 

With the support of the Analytical
              and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Doak and his group at Arizona State
              University are examining the fundamental reaction dynamics of metastable
              molecular nitrogen interacting with semiconductor surfaces.  The focus of this
              work is on understanding the mechanisms of growth of nitride and oxynitride
              semiconductor and insulator thin films.  Information from these studies is
              relevant to the design of important semiconductor and electronic device
              processing methods.
