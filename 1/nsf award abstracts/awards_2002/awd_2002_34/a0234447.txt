Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at The University of Southern
              California will acquire a 400 MHz Fourier Transform NMR Spectrometer. This
              equipment will enable researchers to carry out research on the following:  1)
              activation and functionalization of alkanes; 2) development of new molecules
              and polymers for optical and photonic applications; 3) bio-organic probes and
              bio-active organophosphorus compounds; 4) selective functionalization of
              hydrocarbon CH bonds catalyzed by homogeneous metal complexes; 5) new synthetic
              methods and synthesis of bioactive molecules; and 6) studies of carbocations
              and related chemistry.   
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the
              most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure
              of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize
              specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of
              interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR
              spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research.
              The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic
              chemistry, biochemistry and materials chemistry.
