Abstract    :
              Ocean.US was created by the National Oceanographic Partnership Program in late
              2000 as a National Office to promote and facilitate the establishment of an
              integrated and sustained ocean observing system. 
In March 2002, a planning
              workshop was held to create a design and implementation plan for an integrated
              and sustained observing system for the United States. Some 110 attendees
              participated in discussions, the results of which are summarized in the report
              titled " An Integrated and Sustained Ocean Observing System (IOOS) for the
              United States: Design and Implementation" (Ocean.US, 2002). 

The PI has
              played an important role in coordinating these community-planning efforts. His
              continued participation in the Ocean.US activities will provide the continuity
              necessary to keep the initiative moving forward. 

The main effort in the
              coming year will be to provide technical assistance to The National Office for
              Integrated and Sustained Ocean Observations (Ocean.US), to ensure that basic
              research remains an important element of the integrated ocean observing system
              implementation planning process, and to continue and expand research community
              consensus building with respect to ocean observatories. Importantly, the PI
              will contribute to the continuity of the Ocean.US office as it makes the
              transition to a new director during the fall 2002. This transition combined
              with the development of the ten-year implementation plan makes the provision
              for continuity especially important.
