Abstract    :
              This interdisciplinary study, combining organic isotope geochemistry and
              freshwater ecosystem science, seeks to determine the importance and role of
              Aged Terrestrial Organic C (ATOC, which is naturally depleted in 14C) after it
              is exported from landscapes to large rivers.  The investigators will to
              determine what happens to old terrestrial organic matter once it enters a
              river.  The Hudson River is the focus of this study because prior work has
              shown terrestrial organic matter of considerable age (1000 to 5000 years old)
              dominates C inputs to this river.  Observations, experiments and modeling will
              be used to determine (1) the variability in ATOC delivery to large rivers
              across seasons and among tributaries, (2) decomposition rates of ATOC within
              rivers, (3) controls on the balance between ATOC decomposition and export, and
              (4) the importance of ATOC in fueling riverine metabolism, relative to younger
              terrestrial inputs and to primary production within rivers themselves. 
              

Graduate and undergraduate students working on this project will receive
              multi-disciplinary training that will strengthen research and education
              linkages among three collaborating institutions. The investigators will
              continue to develop interactions with Hudson River outreach organizations
              (Clearwater, Scenic Hudson) to communicate project results to the general
              public. The idea that a modern river is influenced by organic matter produced
              in forests centuries ago is a captivating framework with which to educate the
              public about the C cycle in general and rivers in particular, and the
              inextricable link between continents and the ocean.
