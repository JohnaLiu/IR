Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at Bowling Green State University will
              acquire a Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization - Time of Flight
              (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometer. This instrument will be used in a wide variety
              of research projects, including a) investigations on novel metal-organic
              chromophores and materials; b) studies of de novo designed proteins for use in
              electron transfer and DNA damage; c) studies of supramolecular materials as
              anion sensors; and d) investigations on self-assembled RNA motifs.
              

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF)
              mass spectrometry is the technique of choice for obtaining accurate molecular
              weights on molecules up to and over 300,000 daltons, with extremely high
              sensitivity. Use of a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer has therefore become a
              standard technique in studies involving biomolecules.  At Bowling Green, this
              instrument will therefore also be used in the undergraduate Biochemistry
              laboratory for protein analysis.
