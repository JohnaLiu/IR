Description:  This project supports a U.S.-Pakistan Workshop
              on Molecular Biology, Genetics, Genomics and Breeding, with Focus on Abiotic
              Stress Tolerance of Cereal Crops, to be held in Lahore, Pakistan in March 2003.
               The U.S. organizer is Dr. Hans Bohnert, Department of Biology and Crop
              Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Illinois. The Pakistani
              organizers are Dr. Tayyab Husnain, Center of Excellence in Molecular Biology,
              Punjab University, Lahore, Pakistan and Dr. Kauser Malik, Member/Biology,
              Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, Islamabad, Pakistan. The workshop themes are
               "the physiological and agronomical parameters determining stress responses,
              and the integration of traditional breeding techniques with molecular marker
              technology," and "the exchange of information about genomic type studies
              directed towards the understanding of stress tolerance determinants and the
              application of results from mutational studies in model plants to cereal crops
              and their improvement."  The subjects to be covered include: mechanism of
              stress tolerance, functional genomics related to stress tolerance, and plant
              transformation for introduction of stress tolerance traits.  The proceedings
              will identify selected areas of high priority, as well as a literature guide
              for cooperative research.

Scope:  The results of the workshop will include
              identifying joint research that would benefit the United States, Pakistan and
              other countries that must cultivate cereal crops under stressful plant growth
              conditions including drought, excessive heat, and salinity.
