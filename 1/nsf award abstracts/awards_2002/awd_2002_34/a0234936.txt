Abstract    :
              Plants and herbivores comprise the majority of the earth's biodiversity and
              their evolutionary interactions have resulted in an arms race in which plant
              defenses are met by counter adaptations on the part of herbivores.  In tropical
              forests, the vast majority of herbivory occurs by insects feeding on young
              rather than mature leaves and there is enormous variation in damage among
              species, yet we know little of the underlying causes of this variation.  Using
              an approach that explicitly considers the evolutionary history of the
              interaction, this project will examine the chemical defenses of young leaves of
              tropical legume trees, and correlate this with other plant defenses, with leaf
              damage by insect herbivores, and with herbivore life history traits.  Methods
              include analyses of plant chemistry, feeding trials with herbivores to assess
              toxicity, and field measurement of herbivory, timing of leaf expansion, and
              diet breadth of herbivores.  This project will improve our general
              understanding of the ecological and evolutionary interactions between plants
              and herbivores, and will provide data on poorly known tropical forests.  In
              addition, the plants under study have commercial value (fruit), and are used
              for reforestation and for enriching soil nutrients.
