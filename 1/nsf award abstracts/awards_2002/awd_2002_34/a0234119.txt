Abstract    :
              How have Americans' understandings of the risks, implications and appropriate
              responses to acts of terrorism evolved in the aftermath of the terrorist
              attacks of September 11, 2001? In the immediate wake of those attacks, we
              fielded a large nation-wide telephone survey that explored Americans' reactions
              to the strike, their perceptions of the risks of future terrorist attacks, and
              appropriate policy responses both domestically and internationally. This
              project will consist of a follow-up survey with those who responded in the fall
              of 2001 to learn how their perceptions, beliefs and preferences have changed
              over the intervening year. Using batteries of questions employed in 2001, and
              new measures that will explore changes in behavior induced by threats of
              terrorism, we will test hypotheses concerning the stability, coherence and
              relevance of public beliefs and opinions. We will also employ questions to
              understand whether anti-terrorism efforts are seen as compatible with other
              national objectives, such as maintenance of an open society and preservations
              of individual liberties. The results will both inform the scholarly debate on
              the nature and coherence of public opinion and provide important insights into
              public support for policies designed respond to terrorist threats.
