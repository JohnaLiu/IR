Abstract    :
              Gene expression is governed by a number of regulatory sites and mechanisms, many
              of which are still unknown or poorly studied. Regulatory sites are more
              difficult to predict and study than genes, because they are short, variable,
              and change faster than coding regions during evolution.  A comparative analysis
              of short regulatory sites, including prokaryotic cis-regulatory sites, will be
              performed using the genomic DNA sequences from a wide range of species. The
              project will develop new methods for predicting sites based on inherent
              statistical properties of sequence data and on conservation of sequence across
              species, using the sequences of closely related species to improve prediction.
              These methods will be applied to multiple bacterial, plant, and animal genomes
              and the results made available via a website as well as available to the
              community in the form of the new software and databases. The research will
              provide insights into comparative characteristic of regulatory sites in
              different genomes and can also be used to improve gene prediction software.
