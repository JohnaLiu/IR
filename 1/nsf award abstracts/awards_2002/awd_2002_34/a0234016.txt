Abstract    :
              This objective of this exploratory project is to investigate the integration of
              decision-based design theory with engineering design education pedagogy. The
              plan is to design the design of the new engineering curriculum. This
              exploratory project will determine the feasibility of bridging design theory
              research with engineering practice through the planning, development, and
              assessment of two junior level courses. This will serve as a testbed for
              establishing pedagogical metrics for engineering education in design.

This
              project has the potential of significant broader impacts, not only upon
              evolving the education of engineers in a four year curriculum, but also upon
              future engineering practice in how industries will make design decisions within
              the product realization systems.  This exploratory program is based upon the
              high risk hypothesis that a bridge between research in design theory and
              educational pedagogy can be demonstrated, with validation and development of
              metrics for the learning modules developed. The tasks for this Design for "XXX"
              Project, where XXX is learning, are based upon current research in DfX.
