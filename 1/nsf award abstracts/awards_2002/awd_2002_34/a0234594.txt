Abstract    :
              Tapestry of Times Past is a joint project of the Society of Vertebrate
              Paleontology, the Paleontological Society, and the US Geological Survey,
              working together to build a "paleontology portal" for North America.  The
              project is facilitated by the UC Museum of Paleontology.  Its goals are to
              create a central, interactive entry point to paleontology resources on the
              Internet for multiple audiences:  the research community, K-12 education,
              government and industry, the general public, and the media.  The centerpiece of
              the portal is the USGS color-coded geologic map of the contiguous United States
              draped over a shaded-relief digital elevation model.  This map and associated
              stratigraphic column will become interactive, allowing the user to access
              information about particular geographic regions, geologic time periods,
              depositional environments and representative taxa.  By linking together a
              network of local individual museums and institutions, the user will also find
              information specific to the particular geographic region of exploration,
              including current research projects and publications, websites, on-line
              exhibits and educational materials, information on collecting fossils in that
              state, and availability of other resources.  In addition, the site will provide
              a "Doing Paleontology" section that will contain practical links to
              paleontology meetings, careers, academic programs, and other resources as well
              as a "Demonstrations and Tours" section that will house site tours and special
              interactive exhibits developed to enhance the Paleontology Portal.  The project
              will be developed using a very simple initial approach utilizing HTML,
              Javascript, Perl and PerlDBI.  With this approach, anyone with a Web browser
              with Javascript enabled can request information from the database using simple,
              familiar actions such as clicking on the map or key, or using buttons and
              pull-down menus.  Responses are delivered as standard HTML pages, requiring no
              plug-ins or proprietary software.  Later enhancements will include an alternate
              multimedia-rich interface, an alternate query form for more directed, advanced
              queries, and a GIS visualization tool for working with collections and research
              data.  Dissemination strategies will include society publications and websites,
              conference and workshop presentations to target audiences in education and
              geosciences, and working with DLESE and other digital resource libraries.
