Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Massachusetts
              Amherst will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer and refurbish a 200 MHz
              spectrometer.  The new spectrometer will be a part of the High-Field NMR
              Facility at the university - a facility open to research of the Five Colleges
              Consortium (UMass, Smith, Mt. Holyoke, Amherst and Hampshire Colleges) and
              surrounding industries.  This equipment will enable researchers to carry out
              research on the tacticity of, and branching in polyolefins; branching in
              dendritic and hyperbranched macromolecules; mechanistic investigations of
              copper-based catalysts for cross-coupling reactions; structures of conjugated
              polymers; thermodynamics of the unfolding/recognition process; and structural
              dynamics of amphiphilic polymers.   These instruments will also play a vital
              role in training undergraduates and local area high school students. 
              

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
              available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
              used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
              atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
              molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from
              these NMR studies will have an impact in the development of novel polymers.
