Abstract    :
              For decades, biologists have observed that many aquatic animals alter their
              behavior and morphology when they detect predators in the water.  Prey can
              determine which predators are in the water with them, how many predators are in
              the water, and what the predators are eating.  Prey are able to do this because
              they can smell the chemical cues that are given off during predation.  However,
              biologists know almost nothing about the molecular composition of these
              chemicals.  In this proposal, we seek to identify the chemicals that prey use
              to detect predators and to understand how different types of chemical cues
              alter prey behavior and morphology.
