Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Virginia Polytechnic Institute
              and State University will acquire a Superconducting Quantum Interface Device
              (SQUID) magnetometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out
              studies on a) synthesis and characterization of molecule-based magnets; b)
              magnetic targeting of drugs in vivo; c) development of ferromagnetic,
              ferroelectric and ferroelastic materials; d) properties of alkyl-substituted
              metallocenes and indacenes; and e) the synthesis of stable and persistent
              organic radicals that are capable of chelating transition metals. 
A SQUID
              magnetometer is critical for studying the magnetic properties of materials,
              particularly for weakly magnetic/small moment samples. In a DC magnetization
              measurement, one measures the magnetic moment as a function of applied DC
              magnetic field (and/or temperature). Using DC magnetization experiments, one
              can determine magnetic moments or a hysteresis curve, or identify magnetic
              phase transitions. In such a fashion, complete magnetic characterization of
              single crystal samples and films is possible. These types of measurements are
              essential in order to understand polymers and thin films.
