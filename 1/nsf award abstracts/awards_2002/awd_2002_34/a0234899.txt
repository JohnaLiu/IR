Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa
              will upgrade and refurbish an existing high resolution mass spectrometer. This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including 1) the organic
              chemistry of sulfur, selenium, and tellurium compounds; 2) the biosynthesis of
              tetrapyrroles; 3) applications of ionic liquids for fast atom bombardment mass
              spectrometery; 4) studies of fluorine chemistry; 5) the characterization of
              biomimetic chromium carboxylate assemblies; and 6) the incorporation of
              modified nucleosides into nucleic acids. 

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a
              technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular
              compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic
              molecules.  It is one of the fastest growing and most widely used analytical
              instrumentation techniques.  These studies will have a significant impact in a
              number of areas including biochemistry and synthetic organic chemistry.  In
              addition, over 50 student researchers including graduate students,
              undergraduate students and local high school teachers will use mass
              spectrometry in their research projects at the university over the next few
              years.  This instrument will also be available to students and faculty at other
              regional universities.
