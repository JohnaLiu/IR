Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University will
              acquire a Solid-State 400 MHz Multinuclear NMR Spectrometer. This equipment
              will enable researchers to carry out research on a) surface-grafted gels and
              encapsulated catalysts; b) metal phosphonate chemistry; c) copolymerization of
              CO2 and epoxides to provide polycarbonates; d) extended arrays with phosphine
              ligands based on tetrathiafulvalene; e) chemistry of polyfunctional Lewis
              acids; and f) guest-host interactions and local structure in porous solids. 
              

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
              available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
              used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
              atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
              molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from
              these NMR studies will have an impact in fundamental synthetic organic
              chemistry and the development of novel polymers.
