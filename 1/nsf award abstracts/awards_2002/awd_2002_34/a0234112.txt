ABSTRACT

The mission of the
              University of Minnesota Bioinformatics Summer Institute (UMBSI) is to provide
              the highest quality undergraduate level education and research experiences in
              bioinformatics, equipping the new generation of this burgeoning professional
              community with the tools for a successful career in bioinformatics.
              Undergraduates will participate in the Institute for ten weeks during the
              summer.

A series of workshops, seminars and research projects will result in
              the participants having (i) an introductory understanding of contemporary
              issues in bioinformatics (ii) an ability to develop and apply information
              technology solutions to investigate biological systems (iv) an ability to work
              in multi-disciplinary teams and a realization of the importance of doing so in
              bioinformatics, (v) a beginning understanding of the impact of bioinformatics
              solutions on society, including economic, ethical and environmental impacts,
              and (vi) a keen interest in pursuing further studies and a career in
              bioinformatics.

The computer infrastructure at the Digital Technology
              Center, and a team of eighteen faculty position will be involved in the the
              University of Minnesota Bioinformatics Summer Institute for success. The UMBSI
              will offer the training and the skills that will spark the interest to a new
              generation of scientists to undertake leading careers in bioinformatics.
