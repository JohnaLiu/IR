TITLE: NIH-NSF BBSI HST-MGH Summer Institute for Biomedical
              Optics

ABSTRACT

The HST-MGH Summer Institute will focus on introducing
              students to Biomedical Optics, the use of light in biology and medicine, to
              advance our understanding of biology and pathophysiology and to create
              effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The Summer Institute, hosted
              jointly by the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST) and
              The Wellman Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), is designed in
              accordance with the following objectives:

	To introduce students to the
              interdisciplinary nature of bioengineering research
	To introduce students to
              the technologies associated with Biomedical Optics and provide an understanding
              of its strengths and limitations
	To introduce students to current and
              envisioned biological and medical applications of Biomedical Optics

The
              didactic program is based on HST and MGH/Wellman program elements that are
              already in place, and will provide the students with both depth in biomedical
              optics, and breadth in bioengineering more generally. These include:

	A
              formal course on biomedical optics
	Tutorial lectures on the role of light in
              medicine and biology
	An ongoing research lecture series on in
              Photomedicine
	An ongoing seminar series by the Center for Integration of
              Medicine & Innovative Technology (CIMIT), which deals more broadly with the use
              of bioengineering techniques ranging from tissue engineering to image-guided
              therapy, and will provide a broad view of current research at sites both inside
              and beyond MGH.
	Weekly meetings of the research groups into which students
              are placed.
	A research skills module designed to help students plan their
              research and communicate their results orally and in writing.
	Bioethics
              module designed to teach students to identify the ethical considerations of
              their research.

Students in the program will work on research projects in
              the following areas:

	Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)
	Optical Coherence
              Tomography
	In vivo confocal microscopy and multi-photon
              microscopy
	Selective Laser targeting to treat diseases involving the retinal
              pigment epithelium
	Diffuse Optical Tomography imaging of stroke, hemorrhage,
              brain function, and breast cancer
	Improved Microscopy for Surgical
              Pathology
	Video microscopy for Biological Micromechanics
