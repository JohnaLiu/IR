Abstract    :
              The exponential rise in sequence data from diverse organisms continues to
              enhance the power of comparative approaches to understanding protein function. 
              The group has previously developed alignment-based tools to facilitate this
              analysis, by brining into play position-based strategies for predicting
              deleterious mutations and variants in organisms as diverse as bacteria and
              humans.  This project aims to apply a position-based approach to identifying
              deleterious lesions in reverse genetics project and in the analysis of natural
              variants.  A general reverse genetics strategy has been developed that uses
              chemical mutagenesis and screening for point mutations,, and applied to
              establishing a resource for the Arabidopsis community. The proposed tools
              should enhance functional genomics approaches in both academia and industry. 
              Knowledge gained from function genomics is valuable for its own sake, but also
              has the potentials of contributing to broader environmental welfare.
