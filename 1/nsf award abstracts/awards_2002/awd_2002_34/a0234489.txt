Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Wake Forest University will acquire a single crystal
              X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector for small molecule diffractometry. This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including studies on a)
              platinum group metals as DNA metalating and crosslinking agents; b) development
              of a photoreversible enzyme inhibitor that activates by visible light; c) the
              various roles nitroc oxide performs in biological systems; d) preparation of
              low-dimensional cluster materials; and e) reaction mechanisms and structural
              aspects of DNA-targeting natural products. 
The X-ray diffractometer allows
              accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a
              molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate
              information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the
              neighboring molecules. These studies will have an impact in a number of areas,
              including materials chemistry and biochemistry.
