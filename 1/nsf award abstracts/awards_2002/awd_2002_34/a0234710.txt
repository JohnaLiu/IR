Abstract    :
              A major challenge for ecologists is to understand the effects that environmental
              stressors have on community structure and function. This research will
              determine how a novel stressor - increased atmospheric deposition of nitrogen -
              is altering the dynamics of the detritus-based food web associated with the
              northern pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea. Three different types of analyses
              are proposed to address hypotheses related to the trophic dynamics of pitcher
              plan communities. A field 'pulse' experiment will manipulate the species
              composition of the food web and the source of nitrogen. Nitrogen isotopes will
              be used to reveal the movement of nitrogen derived from anthropogenic sources
              and from prey. A greenhouse 'press' experiment will measure the effects of
              different food web structures on nutrient uptake and growth of pitcher plants.
              Experimental results will be used to develop models of community assembly and
              of food web dynamics. The proposed research will reveal the importance of
              anthropogenic stressors on co-evolved systems and contribute to a deeper
              understanding of the contrasting effects of top-down and bottom-up forces on
              the dynamics of non-equilibrial assemblages. The research will result in
              general models that can be applied to other ecological communities experiencing
              novel stressors. It will involve graduate and undergraduate students in
              supervised and independent research.
