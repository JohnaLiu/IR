Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Idaho will
              acquire an Electron-spin Resonance Spectrometer. The new instrument will
              support the research in the following areas: a) characterization of
              ansa-chromocene complexes; b) investigations of protein-small molecule
              interactions; c) studies on the coordination geometry of nitrosyl ligands in
              photoexcited transition metal complexes; d) molecular-level basis for
              antioxidant mechanisms of flavonoids; e) investigation of Cu sorption mechanism
              on clay minerals; and f) properties of Pdtc as a bioremediation agent.  

An
              electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer is an instrument used to
              obtain information about the molecular and electronic structure of molecules.
              It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals
              that are often essential for the initiation of tumor growth and/or a variety of
              chemical reactions. These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, in
              particular biochemistry.
