The proposal deals invariants for three- and
              four-dimensional manifolds,
specifically those which the proposer constructed
              in collaboration Zoltan
Szabo. These invariants appear to be closely related
              to gauge-theoretic
(Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten) invariants, except that they
              have the
advantage of being more combinatorial in nature than their
              gauge-theoretic
predecessors, and hence easier to calculate. To illustrate
              their strength,
one can reprove some results in four-dimensional differential
              topology
which were obtained previously using gauge theory. These invariants
              also
have new topological applications which go beyond gauge theory.
              For
instance, they can be used to give new restrictions on knots
              whose
surgeries give lens spaces. The author hopes to further extend
              this
theory, to see what further insight they may give to topology
              in
dimensions three and four.

The proposal deals with studying the
              intrinsic structure of three- and
four-dimensional spaces. The study of
              four-dimensional spaces was
revolutionized by Simon Donaldson in the early
              80's by his introduction of
"gauge-theoretic techniques". These techniques
              associate to a space the
space of solutions of certain partial differential
              equations (which come
from mathematical physics). Course properties of these
              solution spaces are
then used to give insight into the finer structure of the
              underlying
spaces on which the equations are defined. The proposal deals with
              efforts 
at circumventing these (often difficult to identify) auxiliary spaces
              of 
solutions, to give more directly combinatorial approaches to understanding
              
the way three- and four-dimensional spaces fit together.
