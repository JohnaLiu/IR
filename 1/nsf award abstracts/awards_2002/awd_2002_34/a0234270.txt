Abstract    :
              Efficient numerical algorithms play an increasingly important role in
              computational sciences to make large scale computer simulations tractable.
              Solution of very large sparse matrices has been one of the most time-consuming
              parts of many large scale high performance computer simulation problems. One of
              the important tasks in high performance scientific computing is to identify
              which solver is suitable for what class of applications (sparse matrices), and
              which sparse matrix can be solved by what solver. We will use the
              techniques
and ideas in knowledge discovery and data mining to extract useful
              information and special features from unstructured sparse matrices and to
              design appropriate strategies to match sparse matrices and solvers.

The
              outcome of this exploratory study is some important preliminary data and
              database to demonstrate the feasibility of building a software environment for
              high performance scientific computing applications based on mining sparse
              matrices and extracting features.
