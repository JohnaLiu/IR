Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington
              will upgrade their NMR facilities. This equipment will enable researchers to
              carry out research on a) the determination of protein structure and dynamics;
              b) alkane functionalization with transition metal complexes; c) synthesis and
              reactivity of transition metal hydrides; d) metal mediated oxidation chemistry;
              e) rapid local angular motions and slow conformational changes in DNA; and f)
              RNA recognition by proteins and drugs.  

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
              spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access
              to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying
              out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact
              in fundamental synthetic organic chemistry and biochemistry.
