Abstract    :
              The Building Engineering Team Skills Program proposes to determine industry best
              
practices by culling practitioners' experience and expertise and then
              adapting those
practices to build engineering team skills as part of the
              University educational
experience.

There is a great need for research to
              determine what capabilities, characteristics
and dispositions of engineers
              working on teams are most valued by industry. Similarly,
there is a great need
              to understand what practices best serve to create and nurture which
team
              skills.

Best practices will be determined through multiple research
              methodologies targeting
multiple respondent sources and utilizing a phased
              approach. Completion of each phase
will provide results specifically designed
              to inform the next research phase. There will
be three phases consisting of
              Manager Interviews, Manager Survey, and Engineer
Survey.

After the research
              phases determining skill value and the best practices for creating
              those
skills have been completed, then course curricula, materials and
              exercises will be planned.
Activities will first occur at California State
              University Hayward, then at University of 
California, Berkeley, two
              institutions rich in the diversity of their underrepresented student
              populations.
