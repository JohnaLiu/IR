Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project 1) to assess the summative impact of (WISE) Women in
              Science & Enginerring programs and other programs on student career outcomes;
              2) to develop a standardized methodology for evaluating student career outcomes
              and the relationship to participation in WISE programs and related support
              programs; 3) to pilot-test and evaluate the methodology nationally at selected
              institutions, to ensure generalizability across institutions, and 4) to
              disseminate the model methodology nationally. This unique approach will include
              a web-based format that can be used nationally by institutions, with a back-end
              database and analysis capability.  

Six higher education institutions have
              been identified to participate as pilot sites. These institutions include:
              Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ; University of Michigan, Ann
              Arbor, MI; University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez, PR; the University of Texas at
              Austin, Austin, TX; the Florida International University, Miami, FL; and,
              Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA. These six institutions are
              representative of institutions nationwide, broadly reflect the Carnegie
              classification of institutions, and provide significant numbers of Hispanic and
              African-American students. 

The products that will result from this study
              will include: 1) a template for a user-friendly data collection method for
              tracking WISE program and other support program participation and career
              outcomes, 2) a web-mediated survey instrument and data collection method that
              institutions nationwide can use and which will be analyzed by CWD and
              disseminated to participating institutions, 3) an Exit Survey and a
              Professional Survey to gather career outcomes information, and 4) the results
              of a pilot-test at six institutions.
