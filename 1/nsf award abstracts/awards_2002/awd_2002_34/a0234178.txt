Abstract    :
              This award supports the Gordon Research Conference on Atmospheric Chemistry in
              Big Sky, Montana, September 7-11, 2003. This Gordon Research Conference is one
              of the major meetings in this field. In 2003, the conference will cover a broad
              range of areas in atmospheric chemistry, including tropospheric chemistry -
              laboratory, field and theoretical studies, upper troposphere/lower stratosphere
              - composition, chemistry and transport, and remote sensing. The meeting will be
              attended by both established researchers and young scientists, among them the
              participants of the preceding Atmospheric Chemistry Colloquium for Emerging
              Senior Scientists (ACCESS), and provide invaluable opportunities for
              interactions between scientists in all areas of atmospheric chemistry.
