Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
              will acquire a Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometer
              (FTICR-MS). This equipment will enhance the following research studies:  a)
              palladium (0) complexes of biphenyl-based monophosphine ligands; b) pericyclic
              reactions for organic synthesis; c) asymmetric catalysis; d) proton-coupled
              electron transfer; e) asymmetric metathesis reactions; f) multiple metal-carbon
              bonds; g) new catalysts for living olefin polymerizations; h) new ligands and
              complexes for dinitrogen reduction; and i) liquid crystals and conjugated
              polymers. 

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate
              structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of
              organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules.
