Abstract    :
              A ground based network of wind measuring interferometers can provide a much
              needed temporal monitor of the thermodynamics of the terrestrial mesosphere and
              thermosphere that will both complement and supplement similar measurements from
              the NASA TIMED spacecraft.  Ground studies of the tidal behaviour of the upper
              atmosphere provide details of the amplitude and phase of semi-diurnal and
              diurnal tides which will complement global satellite observations of the extent
              of such tides. Ground studies of the development of geomagnetic storms will
              supplement those from space describing the spatial extent of the storms.  The
              objectives of these ground studies are to provide important new information to
              further understand the energetics and dynamics of the MLTI region of the
              Earth's atmosphere during the two year mission of TIMED.
