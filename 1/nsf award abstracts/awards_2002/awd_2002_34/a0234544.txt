Abstract    :
              This award will support a Field Workshop to measure and sample volatile
              emissions from volcanic centers in the Nicaragua and Costa Rica segments of the
              Central American Volcanic Arc. This workshop is the 8 th Field Workshop
              organized by the IAVCEI Commission on the Chemistry of Volcanic Gases (CCVG)
              and will take place in March 2003. The overall theme of the workshop is
              sampling of volcanic volatile emissions using direct sampling methods and newly
              developed land-based and space-based remote sensing techniques. Organizers and
              attendents will compare techniques and identify methods to improve  current
              measurement strategies. The focus of this workshop is Poas volcano in Costa
              Rica, and Masaya, Momotombo and Cerro Negro volcanoes in Nicaragua. Because
              subduction zone parameters show significant changes between Costa Rica and
              Nicaragua (amount of sediment contributing to arc magmas, slab angle)
              comparison of the volatile emissions from these volcanic centers is expected to
              be interesting. By involving a large number of specialists we hope to most
              accurately resolve variations in volatile compositions and fluxes between the
              different volcanoes and eliminate problems related to sampling and measuring
              techniques.
