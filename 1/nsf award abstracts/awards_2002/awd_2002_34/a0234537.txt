Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Boston College will acquire a
              Spectrofluorometer with Lifetime Capability. This equipment will enhance
              research focused on biomolecules, biomimetic probes and compounds, and novel
              materials.  Some specific projects include a) characterization of materials
              used for multiphoton optical memory; b) molecular sensors for DNA damage
              detection; c) DNA-fluorophore conjugates; d) development of efficient reactions
              for stereoselective organic synthesis; e) interactions of phospholipases with
              interfaces; and f) allosteric control of metabolic pathways.  Investigators at
              several institutions in the Boston area will also use the spectrofluorometer. 
              

The fluorescence spectrometer counts photons of light in the ultraviolet
              (UV) and visible regions. When a sample of material is illuminated by UV light
              at a given frequency or energy, the reflected light consists of the original UV
              light, but also may contain light in the visible region of the spectrum, at a
              lower frequency or energy. The fluorometer is a very sensitive instrument used
              to detect the fluorescence signal.
