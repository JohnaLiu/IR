Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Oregon Eugene will acquire a CCD
              X-ray diffractometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including the following: a) studies of organic molecules of biological and
              technological relevance; b) inorganic catalysts important in the energy field;
              c) nanoclusters for use in electronic devices; d) molecules that can be used as
              non-biological molecular motors; and e) new solid-state materials.  

The
              X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three
              dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and
              it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule
              relative to the neighboring molecules. These studies will have an impact in a
              number of areas, including materials chemistry, preparation of more efficient
              catalysts, and biotechnology.
