Abstract    :
              Research:

This project involves the development and evaluation of nonlinear
              model reduction and control methods for integrated process systems,
              specifically, networks of reaction and separation units with large material
              and/or energy recycle.  Such networks typically exhibit strongly nonlinear
              dynamics which is induced by the recycle and evolves in a slower time scale
              (longer time horizon) compared to the dynamics of the individual units.  This
              time scale separation lends itself naturally to a control paradigm
              which:
Distinguishes between "distributed" control objectives for individual
              process units (fast time scale) and "supervisory" control objectives for the
              overall network (slow time scale), and
Dictates compensating for the
              nonlinearities induced by recycle at the supervisory control level.
Within
              this framework, the main technical tasks will be the derivation of low-order
              nonlinear models of the core network dynamics induced by recycle structures and
              the design of nonlinear supervisory controllers on the basis of these
              models.

The methods to be developed will: (i) enhance fundamental
              understanding of the dynamics and control of highly integrated process systems,
              (ii) enable improving their operation via the design of effective supervisory
              control schemes, and (iii) complement existing plant-wide control methodologies
              and facilitate a more efficient integration of real-time optimization and
              supervisory control.

Impact:

This work could result in more efficient and
              hence more commercially viable operation of chemical plants.  Process systems
              that could benefit from the results of this work include reaction-separation
              networks and individual multi-stage processes with "internal" material recycle
              and/or heat integration, such as high purity and reactive distillation columns.
               The project also involves the development of software tools and a dedicated
              web site which should further enhance the dissemination of the results and the
              infrastructure for research and education.
