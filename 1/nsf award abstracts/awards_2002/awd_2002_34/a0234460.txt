Abstract    :
              This study will test several hypotheses about organic transformations through
              independent thermodynamic models of reversible and irreversible processes in
              comples water/mineral/organic systems.  The hypotheses to be tested include:
              (1) The transformation of solid and liquid organic compounds in heated
              sediments near ridge hydrothermal systems can be interpreted in terms of
              aqueous alteration, hydrolytic disporportionation, and the approach towar
              metastable equilibria using models based on irreversible thermodynamics.  (2)
              Marine dissolved organic matter is altered into characteristic suites of simple
              organic solutes when heated in submarine hydrothermal systems.  These compounds
              are driven toward metastable states at high temperature, but provide support
              for heterotrophic hyperthermophiles when vent fluids mix with seawater.  (3) 
              Owing to coupled electron-transfer processes, there are reaction pathways
              involving inorganic and organic sulfur compounds that expedite the
              transformations documented in hydrothermal organic compounes.
