Abstract    :
              The Gramene Community Curation project will develop a robust network of
              community-based curators for the Gramene comparative mapping database.  Gramene
              is a comparative resource for rice and other cereals based on the emerging rice
              genome sequence.  The project will develop protocols, relationships, and
              community knowledge to facilitate the ability of researchers to contribute
              their expert knowledge, and in turn provide researchers with the skills to
              fully utilize the information available in Gramene.   Travel and development
              through workshops will provide the curators with an opportunity to develop
              standard operating procedures, to design data entry resources, and to draft
              curricula and other training materials.  The standards and software developed
              will be useful for other organisms as well.
