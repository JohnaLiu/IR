Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University will purchase a
              Mass Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including 1) the development of new nickel-catalyzed reactions and the total
              synthesis of complex natural products; 2) the development of new
              metathesis-based approaches to C-glycosides; 3) the total synthesis of
              pharmacologically active natural products; 4) synthesis of complex
              carbohydrates and natural products; 5) synthesis of natural products through
              biosynthetic pathway engineering; and 6) the design and synthesis of enzyme and
              receptor inhibitors. 

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe
              intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast
              array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules.  It is one of the
              fastest growing and most widely used analytical instrumentation techniques. 
              Because of this, it is important for undergraduate and graduate students to be
              exposed to the technique.  Graduate students, undergraduate summer and postdocs
              will use this instrument for their research.
