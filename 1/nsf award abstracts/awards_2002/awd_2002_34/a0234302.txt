This award supports the PI, graduate, and undergraduate
              students from Texas A&M University in a collaboration with Stefan Kaskel of the
              Max Planck Institute for Carbon Research in Muelheim, Germany.  Together, the
              US and German groups will develop novel methods for synthesizing one- and
              two-dimensional particles of structurally complex oxides.  While numerous
              approaches have been developed for synthesizing discretely shaped nanoparticles
              of simple metal oxides, the ability to synthesize one- and two-dimensional
              particles of zeolites and oxides with more complex structures has not been
              demonstrated.  The ability to synthesize anisotropically shaped zeolites
              particles would open up new applications for zeolites where it is crucial for
              the zeolites pore system to have a defined orientation with respect to a
              substrate.  Such applications include sensors, microelectronics components,
              templates for fabricating other nanophases, and low-temperature catalysts in
              microreactors.

The project also has an educational objective.  The project
              will allow the graduate and undergraduate students involves to benefit from
              performing research in another country.  They will develop a heightened
              appreciation of the world around them while also learning important new
              technical skills.
