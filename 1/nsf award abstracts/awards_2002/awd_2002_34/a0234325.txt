Abstract    :
              Under the direction of Dr. Robert D. Drennan, Mr. Manuel A. Roman-Lacayo will
              collect data for his doctoral dissertation in the Masaya region along the
              Pacific coastal plain of Nicaragua. He will conduct a systematic surface
              survey, recording all traces of prehistoric human occupation in an area of 160
              km2 so as to be able to reconstruct in detail how these populations distributed
              themselves across the landscape through the period from about 1000 BC until the
              arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century AD. The earliest Spanish Conquest
              period accounts for the region describe politically and economically
              centralized societies with powerful chiefs. The distributions of settlement in
              earlier periods will reflect when these characteristics emerged and how they
              changed through time. The region offers a wide diversity of abundant resources
              at elevations ranging from 100 to over 800 meters above sea level. Comparing
              the distribution of these re-sources to the patterns of settlement location as
              they changed through time will reveal shifts in the ways in which the region's
              inhabitants took advantage of what it had to offer to satisfy their basic needs
              and to finance a developing political economy.

Complex hierarchical
              societies developed repeatedly in many different regions of the world over
              periods of thousands of years, reflecting the operation of processes deeply
              embedded in human social dynamics. While these developments are all broadly
              parallel, they also manifest interest-ing variations. Some arrive at much
              larger spatial and demographic scales than others and manifest much more
              developed hierarchies. They vary in the social, cultural, political, military,
              and economic bases for centralization and hierarchy. In seeking to understand
              why the devel-opment of such broadly similar social patterns is so pervasive in
              human prehistory as well as why these patterns vary in the ways that they do,
              archaeologists have worked with a number of models. Some of these models focus
              on low-risk, abundant resources and predictability as fa-vorable to the rapid
              development of social complexity, while others consider risk-filled
              environ-ments where resources are scarce as providing the catalyst for major
              social change. Evaluating such contrasting views requires the comparative study
              of a number of cases in which relation-ships between social and environmental
              risk, diversity, abundance, predictability, and long-term social change can be
              assessed. Mr. Roman-Lacayo's research will provide the necessary docu-mentation
              for one such case in a region where resources are varied, abundant, and
              predictable.

The broader impacts of this research will include the training
              of a number of young scientists, not only the doctoral candidate himself, but
              also less advanced students who will participate in carrying out the fieldwork
              and gain valuable methodological experience. It will also help to fos-ter
              healthy collegial relationships between scientists in the U.S. and Nicaragua.
