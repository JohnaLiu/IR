Abstract    :
              This project addresses the important question of whether gas phase reactions
              between ammonia and organic acids can lead to enhanced formation of secondary
              organic aerosol (SOA) through the formation of amino-organic compounds.  A
              series of laboratory experiments will be performed to measure and characterize
              - under differing temperature and relative humidity regimes - SOA formation
              rate and mechanism in the presence of ammonia for a variety of atmospherically
              relevant hydrocarbons.  This exploratory study could potentially reconcile some
              important outstanding issues with respect to SOA formation pathways leading to
              observed fine particulate mass concentrations - of especially high relevance as
              the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency promulgates national ambient air
              quality standards for fine particulate matter.  The educational component
              supports a postdoctoral researcher, graduate student and two undergraduates at
              the host institution.
