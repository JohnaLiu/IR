TITLE: NIH-NSF BBSI on Simulation and Computer
              Visualization of Biological Systems at Multiple Scales

ABSTRACT 
 
This
              project is to develop a Bioengineering & Bioinformatics Summer Institute (BBSI)
              entitled NIH-NSF BBSI on Simulation and Computer Visualization of Biological
              Systems at 
Multiple Scales. for undergraduate and graduate students with
              strong analytical and 
quantitative skills, and high potential for careers in
              Computational Biology, Bioengineering, or Bioinformatics. The BBSI will be a
              joint program of the University of Pittsburgh (lead institution), the
              Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, and Duquesne University, and will also
              include faculty from Carnegie Mellon University. A major strength of this
              academic community is the breadth and depth of experience with biological
              models and simulations, from molecular to multicellular, and from analytical
              approaches to massively parallel computing. 
 
The objectives are to: (i)
              provide students with a unique training and research 
experience through a
              series of cross-disciplinary lectures, computational laboratory sessions, and
              independent research opportunities not available in traditional undergraduate
              programs;  specifically, to present an integrated view of molecular-to-cellular
              analytical approaches and fundamental physicochemical, statistical mechanical,
              and kinetic principles needed for predictive theoretical and computational
              research; (ii) broaden the student's view of post-genomic computational and
              mathematical research areas in molecular, cellular, and systems biology, and
              (iii) motivate students to pursue careers in the field(s). 
 
Applicants will
              be accepted, from basic life or physical sciences, computer science,
              mathematics or engineering, and three first year graduate students.  A ten-week
              program will encompass six weeks of lecture and computer lab coursework, three
              weeks of mentored research activity, and 1 week of student presentations.  In
              addition, a weekly seminar series will cover a wide variety of related topics
              with presentations from local or invited outside experts, as well as
              discussions of scientific ethics and career opportunities. Student-organized
              journal clubs, and involvement of senior or graduate students in teaching
              activities will ensure efficient communication and contribute to professional
              growth.
