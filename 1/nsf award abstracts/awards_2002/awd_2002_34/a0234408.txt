Abstract    :
              WGBH is conducting preliminary work on an untested and novel idea for a new
              multimedia project, EGames. The target audience for the project is children
              ages 9-12.  The project envisions a 13-part television series which combines
              the appeal of a game show with the drama of real-world challenges to engender
              enthusiasm and promote understanding of engineering in kids nationwide.  The
              television programs will be complemented with materials and training for
              engineers to mount EGames events in public venues and run workshops in schools,
              afterschool programs and libraries, and an extensive companion
              website.

During the research phase, WGBH will convene a Content Advisory
              Board which would include professional engineers, curriculum developers,
              classroom teachers, professors of engineering and informal educators, and a
              Funding Advisory Board.  They will also write the series curriculum, design the
              game, develop outreach, Web, and evaluation plans, and develop and test a
              sample engineering challenge with a group of contestants to work out logistic
              and production questions.  This will inform the next stage of project
              development.
