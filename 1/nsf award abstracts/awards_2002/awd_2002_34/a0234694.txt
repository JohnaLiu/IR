Abstract    :
              Multiple parties are increasingly using distributed information systems,
              especially the Internet, for automated negotiations.  Game theory provides a
              basis for engineering incentives into the interaction mechanisms of these
              systems so that desirable social outcomes follow -- even though every party
              acts based on self-interest. However, there is a hazardous gap in game theory
              when it comes to incentives and computation, leaving such systems open to
              manipulation. Extensions to game theory that address computation are required
              for settings where the participants are self-interested, and there is an
              underlying intractable problem that limits the agents' rationality. In this
              project, a theory of interaction is being developed where computational actions
              are treated as part of each agent's strategy. The work involves model
              development, game-theoretic analysis, mechanism and algorithm design, and
              computational experiments. This research paves the way to building secure
              systems that are robust against manipulation, yet computationally feasible. The
              theories being developed allow the construction of optimal negotiating agents
              in settings where computation is an issue. This enables wider and fairer access
              to Internet commerce by putting novices, assisted by these software agents, on
              an equal playing field with expert market participants. The methodology being
              developed also enables the design of economically and computationally more
              efficient interaction mechanisms.
