Abstract    :
              Grid computing, or using several potentially heterogeneous computers to execute
              an application, is becoming increasingly popular.  A grid poses significant
              software challenges for parallel computing; in particular, fundamental parallel
              computing problems are made more difficult.  This project focuses on the data
              distribution problem, which is to distribute data to processors to minimize
              application completion time.  We will re-examine the data distribution problem
              on one specific instance of a grid: a local area network of heterogeneous
              computers.  Processors in such a cluster can have different relative CPU
              speeds, different amounts of available physical memory, and different effective
              I/O latencies.  In addition, we will support the increasing number of
              out-of-core programs on these clusters.

We will address this data
              distribution problem through the design and implementation of what we call
              Heterogeneous Cluster MPI (HC-MPI), which will be constructed as extensions and
              analysis built into MPI. The extensions will (1) assist users in writing
              adaptable programs and (2) allow HC-MPI to collect enough program information
              to determine automatically an effective data distribution.  The expected impact
              of this work is to allow computational scientists to execute parallel programs
              efficiently on a variety of heterogeneous clusters.
