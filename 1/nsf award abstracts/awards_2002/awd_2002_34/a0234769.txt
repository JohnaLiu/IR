Abstract    :
                 Pheromones are chemical compounds released by an animal that can act as
              specific attractants for a mate, and are well studied in moths and other
              insects. In the air, the odor plume is characterized by turbulent eddies; thus,
              detection can involve rapid changes between a high intensity odorant signal and
              complete absence of a signal.  To maximize detection among the complex mix of
              odorants in a normal environment, the olfactory system needs to be able to
              inactivate pheromonal chemical signals rapidly because a high temporal
              resolution is needed to follow the pulsatile signals of the turbulent plume
              correctly to its source.  This project utilizes biochemistry and molecular
              biology in a novel protocol to isolate enzymes from the antenna of the wild
              silkmoth, and to test the hypothesis that fast inactivation of pheromones in
              the insect antenna is achieved by pheromone-degrading enzymes.  Results will
              help to resolve the controversy over whether such degradation may be more
              important than binding proteins for the fast inactivation.  This study will
              have an impact beyond sensory neurobiology to a possible potential in designing
              biosensors and for pest control measures.  The project also provides training
              opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, particularly from
              under-represented groups.
