Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Tulane University will acquire a
              300 MHz Multinuclear NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers
              to carry out research on synthetic organic and inorganic chemistry, natural
              product characterization and mechanistic chemistry.  NMR will be used in the
              characterization of new main group and organometallic compounds, natural
              products, novel organic precursors for organic materials development, bioactive
              organic reagents, supramolecular transition metal complexes, and analysis of
              products from organic reactions carried out in zeolites.  In addition, faculty
              from Loyola University and Xavier University will have access to the equipment.
              
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
              available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
              used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
              atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
              molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from
              these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic chemistry and
              biochemistry.
