Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Louisiana State University will
              upgrade a 400 MHz solid-state NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable
              researchers to carry out research in a number of areas:  a) molecular
              interactions of pesticides, toxics with soil; b) characterization of novel
              polymer materials; c) characterization of organic sorbents in sediments; and d)
              studies on the structure of fibrils formed by protein self-assembly.
Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to
              chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
              identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms
              within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules
              in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
              studies will have an impact in environmental and materials chemistry and
              biotechnology.
