Abstract    :
              This project will complete construction of a high-quality digital bathymetry
              database for the Southern Ocean component of the Global Ocean Ecosystem
              Dynamics GLOBEC) program.  Existing along-track and swath bathymetry data
              collected in Marguerite Bay and in the West Antarctic Peninsula shelf study,
              have been assembled and merged with new SeaBeam and along-track data collected
              during cruises of the research vessels R/V Palmer and R/V Gould in 2001 and
              2002. New bathymetry data has also been obtained from other US, British, and
              Russian sources to extend the program database. Once the final R/V Palmer and
              R/V Gould  cruises are completed and other data added, the program database
              will be closed, edited, documented and made publicly available for use by
              international GLOBEC investigators and by the broader geophysics community. 
              These results will be developed in conjunction with, and will become part of a
              planned circum-antarctic high resolution bathymetry database.
