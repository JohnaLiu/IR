Abstract    :
              The idea of providing differentiated network services to customers with
              different usage profiles is gaining strong commercial support.  Many companies
              are providing solutions to policy-based management for desired Quality of
              Service (QoS).  These network-based services range from application level
              control to bandwidth management.  However, the onus of deciding or designing
              these policies rests on network managers.  The view taken by most solution
              providers is that of a static organization where requirements can be assessed
              in advance.  Consequently, at the user end overprovision of services has become
              a norm. This proposal investigates the economics of differentiated network
              service arrangements in business environments and the design and development of
              realistic network environments to conduct experiments and evaluate performance
              of a wide class of pricing approaches.  The class of approaches we propose to
              investigate range from purely deterministically guaranteed QoS through
              contracts to real-time pricing that provides consumers with option to buy a QoS
              for each application at the time of consumption. To test the various pricing
              schemes, the token-bucket paradigm will be used. It will simulate a given
              price/contract arrangement. The framework for economic experiments developed by
              this project will provide a benchmark tool to assess network efficiency under
              different contractual arrangements.
