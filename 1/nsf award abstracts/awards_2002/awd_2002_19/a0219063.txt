Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a collaborative effort between investigators
              at MIT and Rice University to integrate access to the Grid computing model with
              the existing ROOT software framework, which is the de-facto standard in high
              energy and nuclear physics data analyses. To deal with the large amounts of
              data to be collected by the high energy physics experiments at the Large Hadron
              Collider (LHC) at CERN, Switzerland, CMS and the other LHC collaborations are
              adopting the Grid paradigm that aims to provide consistent and efficient access
              to geographically distributed computing resources.  The goal of the project is
              to make Grid services available to ROOT users. This will be based on the PROOF
              extension of ROOT and will be implemented in close collaboration with the ROOT
              authors at CERN. Phase I will involve the initial design, development and
              prototyping cycle and a detailed benchmarking and evaluation period. In phase
              II, production versions will be used on existing clusters for RHIC data and CMS
              simulation data.
