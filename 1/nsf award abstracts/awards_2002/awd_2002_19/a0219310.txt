Title: Networking
              Urban Ecological Models Through Distributed Services

        Urbanization is
              a central force in altering core ecological processes such as biogeochemical
              cycling, decreased biodivesity and changing land use and land cover.
              Understanding and managing these processes is crucial to sustaining natural
              resources and maintaining quality of life. The goal for this project is to
              develop and deploy a distributed information infrastructure so that diverse
              members of the urban ecological research community in central Arizona can
              benefit from integrated ecological models and data. Government agencies
              involved will include the Maricopa Association of Governments and the Arizona
              Dept. of Water Resources.
