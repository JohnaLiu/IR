Abstract    :
              A new design methodology for multi-antenna wireless system is proposed. The
              essential idea is based on the fusion of technologies and concepts in the
              antenna design, RF circuit and device technology, real-time DSP technology and
              communication theory. To embody this idea, novel designs of high-performance
              "signal processing" array front-ends and the associated communication
              processing research are proposed. The proposed array front-ends cover a broad
              range of hardware from the antenna array, RF circuits all the way to IF or
              baseband outputs. As a testbed, we propose a receiving antenna array with a
              single RF-channel and Spatial MultIplexing of Local Elements (SMILE). The
              communication processing research is focused on the study of space-time
              propagation channels and the applications of Continuous Phase Modulation (CPM)
              coding scheme in a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system based on the
              proposed front-end. Studies of system level issues in merging the hardware
              architectures and communication algorithms are also proposed. The
              interdisciplinary nature of this project ensures close interactions among
              faculty members and students from different disciplines. Hence, the project
              will benefit the curriculums and graduate research subjects in multiple areas
              such as microwave and RF technology, real-time signal processing and wireless
              communication.
