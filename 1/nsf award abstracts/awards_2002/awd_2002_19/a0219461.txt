Abstract    :
              The Center for Bibliographical Studies at the University of California,
              Riverside, is in the process of digitizing the Burney Collection of
              eighteenth-century English newspapers at the British Library.  Access is
              currently possible only through a single microfilm copy in the reading room,
              because of the fragility of the originals. Use of even a digitized version
              could remain cumbersome and time-consuming because of the large size of the
              collection, 650,000 pages, and access limited by date and title.  Heretofore
              the vagaries of handset type, uneven lines, broken letters, smudged or changing
              ink intensities and yellowing paper, it has not been possible produce an
              accurate, searchable text through available optical character reading software.
               The emergence of new technologies now enables the Center to produce a
              searchable text with a high degree of accuracy.  A fully searchable text linked
              to digital images will permit extraordinary access and unlock for researchers
              the incredibly rich range of data the Collection contains.  The result will
              provide a new model for accessing both periodicals and monographs of the
              hand-press era.    It  will open up whole new research strategies and topics. 
              And it will extend the wonders of computer-based text searching to the corpus
              of texts that form the foundation of the modern world.
