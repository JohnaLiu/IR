Abstract    :
              P.I. Webster, Donald (Georgia Tech)	Proposal #: 0219519

The PIs propose to
              develop a new apparatus to simulate oceanic turbulence in the laboratory. The
              work proposed is a one-year effort to complete the design, construct, and
              validate the apparatus. The proposed equipment is superior to traditional
              designs, such as grid-oscillating tanks, because of greater isotropy, improved
              homogeneity, increased simplicity, increased controllability, increased
              transportability, and reduced cost. The system consists of a cubic Plexiglas
              box with an actuator located at each corner. Each actuator alternatively forces
              fluid out of and draws fluid into a small hole in the box wall. This action
              induces a turbulent pulsed jet originating from each corner aimed at the box
              center; the net result of the eight actuators is a highly isotropic and
              homogeneous turbulent region in the volume surrounding the box center. This
              system is based on a previous apparatus constructed for use with gases. Once
              validated, the system will have broad application for research in physical and
              biological oceanography as well as fundamental fluid mechanics.
