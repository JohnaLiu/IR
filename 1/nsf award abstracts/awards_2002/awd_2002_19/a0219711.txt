Abstract    :
              With the rapid emergence of Internet-based techniques and the
explosive growth
              of pervasive computing, there will be an exponential increase of customers
              accessing information through battery powered mobile devices.  Data access
              techniques proposed for wired networks may not be feasible for mobile
              environments due to the limitations of bandwidth and power.  Therefore, it has
              become necessary to re-evaluate and possibly redesign data access strategies to
              efficiently utilize bandwidth and power considering the limitations of mobile
              environments. In single-hop mobile environments, the research will address the
              issues associated with broadcasting and caching techniques, i.e., the energy
              consumption issue, the query latency issue, the bandwidth utilization issue,
              and the scalability issue. The research in multi-hop mobile environments
              concentrates on designing and evaluating cooperative caching techniques to
              reduce the bandwidth and power consumption, and to address scalability, cache
              consistency, and security issues.  A testbed will be used to evaluate the
              proposed data access mechanisms in an integrated manner and evaluate the
              effects of various techniques on the overall system performance.  The research
              results will have significant impacts on making pervasive computing more
              affordable to the increasing customer demands and more amenable to commercial,
              civilian, and military applications.
