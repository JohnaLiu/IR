Abstract    :
              Due to the expressiveness of Extensible Markup Language (XML) as compared to
              HTML, XML has become a standard format in data presentation for the web
              applications. However, in content based retrieval, if the database content does
              not match with the query conditions exactly, or if the query conditions are not
              well presented, the system returns null answer. The user must reformulate and
              resubmit the query for processing. Therefore, when the query conditions are not
              known exactly (e.g. matching an image with a set of features or a document with
              a set of key words), the user often specifies them in a general way to avoid a
              null answer. The drawback of such an approach is that the system may return too
              many and sometimes irrelevant answers. To remedy this problem, a systematic and
              scalable knowledge based (derived from the XML data) relaxation methodology
              will be developed to relax the query conditions (both in value and / or
              structure). Further, the user can provide such relaxation control as the order
              of attributes to be relaxed, relaxation level, the unrelaxable attribute list,
              number of answers, etc. As a result, such technique provides a focused and
              controlled relaxation, and thus yields more accurate and relevant
              answers.

In this proposal, the existing XML query language will be extended
              to support query relaxation and relaxation control constructs, and techniques
              will be developed to cluster similar data trees from XML data into a hierarchy
              to serve as an index to guide relaxation.
