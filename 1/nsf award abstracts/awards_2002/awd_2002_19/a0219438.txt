Abstract    :
              

This award addresses an important fundamental problem in computational
              mathematics: how to optimize complex systems described by partial differential
              equations (PDEs). The focus is on PDE simulations that can scale into millions
              of variables, and hundreds or thousands of processors. The size of the problems
              and the complexity of the techniques for solving these PDEs pose major
              challenges to modern optimization methods. The project uses a general framework
              for solving optimization problems in interaction with PDE solvers.
