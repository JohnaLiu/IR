Abstract    :
              The growing popularity of mobile devices with wireless capabilities
imposes new
              and fundamental challenges in extending the capabilities
of wired Internet
              applications to the wireless domain. This project will
investigate proxy-based
              techniques for enabling the next generation of
mobile multimedia and web
              applications. The proposed research will focus on
three characteristics of
              mobile environments, namely client mobility,
intermittent connectivity, and
              resource-poor nature of mobile devices. 
Research issues that will be
              addressed in this project include
(i) power-friendly streaming techniques and
              real-time handoffs for
mobile multimedia applications, and (ii) caching and
              dissemination of
time-varying and location-dependent data accessed by mobile
              web
applications.  The proposed techniques will be evaluated using
              an
eclectic mix of simulation, analysis and prototype implementation.
              The
significance of the proposed research arises from the widespread
              and
growing use of mobile devices that provide ubiquitous, wireless access
to
              data on the Internet.  The likely impact of this research will be
to advance
              the state of the art in proxy-based infrastructures for
next-generation mobile
              multimedia and web applications.
