Abstract    :
              This project investigates two problems associated with the monitoring of human
              activities: The first problem is tracking of articulated motion as a whole
              without identifying individual limb motion. The goal is to address certain
              shortcomings in previous solutions to this problem, the main shortcoming being
              their over-constrained nature.  The proposed solution, which is presented as a
              real-time human tracking
system, will be capable of working under many
              difficult circumstances. The second problem is recognition of
articulated
              motion. The goal here is to show that the recovery of three-dimensional
              properties of the object or even two-dimensional tracking of the object parts
              are not necessary steps that must precede action recognition. The proposed
              approach uses motion features only. Unlike other similar approaches, the
              motion
features will be used in such a way to represent complex and long
              actions as well as to distinguish different actions with many similarities. 
              Each action is represented as a manifold in the lower dimension space and
              matching is done by comparing these manifolds. As part of a homeland security
              scenario, its is planned to use these methods to monitor outdoor human
              activities based on the ability to recognize, for example, that a human runs in
              the opposite direction that a crowd moves.
