Abstract    :
              Software systems have become increasingly complex, and are expected to
provide
              service over wide operating ranges.  To meet service goals,
software
              developers provide many tuning  parameters that must be
set carefully for the
              system to provide acceptable performance and
functionality.  Tuning these
              parameters adequately often requires extensive
trial-and-error experimentation
              by system administrators.  As workloads and
operating conditions continually
              change, the parameters must be endlessly
re-tuned to provide good
              performance.

This research project will apply feedback control to automate
              this
parameter tuning loop in two example systems.  The first, a
              wide-area
replicated file system, provides variable consistency and
              performance
through optimistic concurrency control.  Feedback will be used to
              schedule
replica reconciliation and data migration  to provide
              acceptable
performance and consistency to end users.  The second system, a
              database
engine, offers a large variety of tuning parameters to be
              considered.
Feedback control will be used to enable database administrators to
              manage
the growing complexity of their server systems.

 From these two
              examples and other work, a framework for feedback control of
dynamic computing
              systems will begin to emerge.  This framework will enable
future computing
              systems to offer reliable and robust operation and
predictable performance,
              without costly maintenance and continual manual
tuning.
