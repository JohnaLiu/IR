Funding is provided for a two year continuation of the
              principal investigator's studies on the long-term variability of the North
              Atlantic as an Accomplishment Based Renewal.  This research project builds on
              the successful field program  of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE),
              and the analysis of most of the cruise data and other data relating to decadal
              variability in the region. The specific topics that will be investigated are:
              (1) continued studies of zonal circulation using in-situ data and inverse
              methods for the 52W hydrographic section;  (2) understanding  of  the nature
              and source of sub-annual energy in the subtropical gyre, which seems to
              dominate inter-annual energy both in the long Bermuda time series and for the
              altimeter; (3) investigation of the reason for strong persistence of SST
              anomalies in the region of the Slope Water south of Cape Cod; and extending the
              use of proxy data for the study of wintertime climate  variability  extending 
              back  into  the  19th  century  to understand long-term cycles in sensitivity
              to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).
