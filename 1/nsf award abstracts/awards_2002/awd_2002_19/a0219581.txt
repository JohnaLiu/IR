Abstract    :
              New local-domain helioseismic observations reveal the presence of complex,
              large-scale, horizontal sub-solar-surface flows.  These remarkable weather-like
              flow patterns, now called Solar Subsurface Weather, are occurring within a
              zonal shear layer in which the rotational angular velocity increases rapidly
              with depth.  The flows possess intricate patterns that change from one day to
              the next, accompanied by steady large-scale handed zonal jets and meridional
              circulation cells.  Synoptic maps of this "solar weather" indicate that the
              Sun's magnetic field modulates flow speeds and directions.  This effort will
              (1) develop an improved ring-diagram analysis technique that will be applied to
              the GONG+ data to provide continuous real-time coverage of solar weather, (2)
              use the synoptic solar weather maps to better characterize the magnetic
              modulation, (3) determine if the modulation can be used to predict and forecast
              magnetic eruptive activity in the solar atmosphere, and (4) evaluate angular
              momentum transport within the solar convection zone with the goal of
              understanding how the Sun maintains its observed differential rotation.
