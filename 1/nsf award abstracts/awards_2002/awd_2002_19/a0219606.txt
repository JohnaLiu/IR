Abstract    :
              This project develops a decision-theoretic framework for planning and control of
              multi-agent systems by formalizing the problem as decentralized Markov process.
               It applies to a wide range of application domains in which decision-making
              must be performed by multiple collaborating agents such as information
              gathering, distributed sensing, coordination of multiple robots, as well as the
              operation of complex human organizations.  While substantial progress has been
              made in planning and control of single agents using MDPs, a similar formal
              treatment of multi-agent systems has been lacking.  Existing techniques tend to
              avoid a central issue: agents typically have different information about the
              overall system and they cannot share all this information all the time. 
              Sharing information has a cost that must be factored into the overall decision
              process.  Three approaches to communication are studied based on (1) a
              cost/benefit analysis of the amount of communication, (2) search in policy
              space, and (3) transformations of the more tractable centralized policies into
              decentralized policies.  The resulting techniques are evaluated in the context
              of several realistic applications.  This research facilitates a better
              understanding of the strengths and limitations of existing heuristic approaches
              to coordination and, more importantly, it includes new approaches based on more
              formal underpinnings.
