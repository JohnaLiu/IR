This award supports Fraser Fleming and a student from Duquesne
              University in a a collaboration with Seija Kulkki of the Center for Knowledge
              and Innovation Research at the Helsinki School of Economics in Helsinki,
              Finland.  The project will focus on the impact of different external and
              internal forces on the economic role of the universities, particularly the
              technological universities and thus on the nature of industry-university
              interactions.  Implications for this dynamic relationship are to be found in
              many aspects of business development and entrepreneurship in Finland.

While
              many scholars have written about the importance of research universities in the
              growth of agglomerations of high-technology industry and of close ties between
              universities and industrial organizations as a contributor to economic
              development, much remains to be learned about the dynamics of the process.  The
              main questions to be addressed by the present study are how the universities
              are adapting to the chances in external forces that affect them, how the
              missions of the universities are changing in response to changing conditions in
              society with respect to stimulating regional growth, and what organizational
              structures and processes are used to help technology transfer and business
              incubation.  The collection and analysis of data will be done in conjunction
              with the group in Helsinki and several junior researcher from the US group will
              participate in the international collaboration.
