Abstract    :
              This project addresses technical challenges that face next-generation immersive
              visual communication. It proposes to study one particular type of immersive
              communication system base on auto-multiscopic (eyewear-free multiview) 3-D
              display. Such a system would consist of three closely-spaced digital video 
              cameras, standard PCs, some compression hard-ware/software, and the said
              multiscopic display. This system would allow interaction in 3-D space by
              allowing depth perception, and moreover, "look-around", i.e., geometrically
              correct viewing from a number of viewpoints.  Anticipated applications are 3-D
              videoconferencing, remote collaboration, telecommuting, etc.
