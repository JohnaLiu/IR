ABSTRACT

The PI has enhanced
              the supercritical antisolvent (SAS) process for micron sized particle formation
              by including an ultrasonic transducer in the precipitation vessel to interact
              with the solvent jet creating mush smaller particles in the sub-micron range. 
              The technique is innovative and further knowledge of the fundamental mechanism
              of operation would provide the information to optimize the method.
