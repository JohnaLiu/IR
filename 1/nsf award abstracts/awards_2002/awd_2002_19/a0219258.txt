Abstract    :
              This proposal will explore fundamental research issues that impact performance
              and scalability of Wide Area Applications. The proposed research undertakes a
              comprehensive study of the access latencies and changing behavior of digital
              resources over time and across different applications, when accessed via the
              dynamic WAN. One objective of this research is to develop appropriate latency
              profiles and resource profiles to characterize this behavior. Latency profiles
              will be developed to reflect the end-to-end delay experienced by a cluster of
              clients and resources (servers). Resource profiles reflect appropriate metrics,
              such as existence checking, testing reachability over time, and learning
              patterns of updates. These profiles will be used to customize service and
              information delivery to clients, considering both application requirements and
              the noisy WAN environment. The corresponding algorithms will explore the
              trade-offs between end-to-end latency and data obsolescence for different
              application requirements. Research results will aim to establish a consistent
              framework for profiling and to answer the following question: to what extent
              can profiling be used in improving clients' availability to resources.  Formal
              results developed in the theoretical study will be evaluated on large scale
              applications.  Collaboration with Corporation for National Research Initiative
              (CNRI) Handle protocol developers will provide a test-bed for large scale
