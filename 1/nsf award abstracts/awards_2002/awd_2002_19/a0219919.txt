              ABSTRACT

OCE-0219919

The coastal mud wave at Sinnamary, French Guiana and
              the clinoform muds in the Gulf of Papua are systems wherein massive suboxic
              diagenesis takes place and represent sites that effectively remineralize
              terrestrial and marine organic matter.  Two scientists from the State
              University of New York at Stony Brook plan to continue their research efforts
              in these tropical mobile mud belts to refine their interpretations of the
              biogeochemical processes at these sites, determine the interaction between the
              mobile mud belts and surrounding sedimentary environments, complete laboratory
              experiments on authigenesis and microbial metabolic activity and develop
              comparative models of these two regions.  In French Guiana, the PIs hope to
              assess the properties of sedimentary material which becomes entrained into the
              suboxic mobile zone during wave migration and mangrove erosion.  In the Gulf of
              Papua, this team of scientists will sample across the shelf from the mangrove
              fringe to the foreset region at 60m water depth during the NW Monsoon and SE
              Trade Period.  The goals of the project as this site are the following:  (1)
              quantify and model cycling rates, reaction pathways, reactive material source,
              sedimentary storage of biogenic debris and nutrient remineralization in the top
              1-3m; (2) determine relative role of unsteady versus steady sedimentation
              processes in maintaining the biogeochemical properties across the region: (3)
              characterize the associations and interactions of benthic biological
              communities with particular biogeochemical/physical regimes; and (4) obtain
              sedimentary authigenic mineral suites and biogenic trace records for
              environmental reconstruction.  The team of scientists will collaborate with
              scientists from the University of Washington whom will be looking at the
              sediment dynamics of the Gulf of Papua, as well as Australian scientists.
