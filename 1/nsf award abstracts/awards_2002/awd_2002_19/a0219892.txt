Abstract    :
              We are in the midst of a new wireless revolution, brought on by
the adoption of
              wireless networks for consumer, military,
scientific and other applications.
              Wireless networks are a
collection of terminals, or nodes, that are capable
              of
transmitting and receiving information to nearby nodes using
wireless
              access methods. The harsh characteristics of the wireless channel provide
              the
fundamental challenge for communication between wireless network
nodes.
              The key to reliable communication over wireless links is the
exploitation of
              diversity, i.e., observation of the same
information through different fading
              conditions. While it is
possible to harness diversity by transmitting the same
              signal at
different times or frequencies, the implied redundancy is
              costly
from a bandwidth perspective. It has been shown, however,
              that
introducing additional antennas at the source and/or
destination enables
              diversity gain without compromise in
bandwidth efficiency. Wireless network
              nodes may or may not be equipped with multiple
antennas. How then, can they
              ensure reliable and
efficient communication over the fading wireless channel?
              In this research, we investigate
novel strategies by which nodes
transmit and
              receive cooperatively, allowing
exploitation of spatial diversity gain that
              would otherwise be
unavailable.

The lack of structure in ``ad-hoc''
              wireless networks is
advantageous from the viewpoint of
              flexibility,
re-configurability, and low management cost. The same lack
              of
structure, however, makes the implementation of cooperative
strategies
              challenging. It may be difficult, for example, to know
which of the helper
              nodes have correctly received the message. In
fact, it may be difficult to
              know which, if any, of the nodes can
be enlisted as helpers. In this research,
              we solve these problems
through the combination of distributed cooperative
              coding
strategies, clever protocols, and sophisticated signal
processing
              techniques. The PIs are leveraging their respective expertise in
space-time
              coding and blind signal processing to devise
practical strategies for
              cooperative communication in
wireless networks. In addition, this research
              investigates the
fundamental limits on the capacity of cooperative
              wireless
networks through a study of information-theoretic bounds.
