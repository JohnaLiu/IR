Abstract    :
              The problem of developing efficient automated systems of logical
inference is a
              key step toward the dream of creating verifiable,
reliable, and secure
              hardware and software systems.  This research is
aimed at developing a
              well-founded, unified theory of practical
logical inference, that combines
              complementary ideas and powerful
approaches for propositional inference
              developed in AI, formal
verification, and theoretical computer
              science.

This unified theory will focus on (ii) combining the
              different
representations used in the various approaches to
              propositional
inference, such as Boolean decision diagrams and conjunctive
              normal
form, in order to take advantage of the diverse algorithmic
              techniques
associated with each; (ii) developing new and improved
              inference
algorithms using the combined representation; (iii)
              precisely
characterizing the power of various heuristic inference
              techniques,
such as clause learning and randomized search; and (iv) developing
              a
rigorous understanding of how problem structure indicates the
potential
              effectiveness of particular inference strategies.

The research will involve
              theoretical work using methods of proof
complexity as well as experimental
              work on logical encodings of both
real-world verification problems and AI
              planning problems.  The
ultimate goal research is to significantly expand the
              size and
complexity of software and hardware systems that are amenable
              to
formal analysis.
