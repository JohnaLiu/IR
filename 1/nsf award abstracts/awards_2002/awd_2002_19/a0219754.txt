Abstract    :
              This research project explores the extent to which the proliferation of
              technology-enabled, international distributed teams can serve a social as well
              as an economic good by promoting cross-national understanding and the
              competence of members.  Two issues of theoretical and practical significance
              are examined in depth, subgroup dynamics and cross-national learning processes.
               Understanding these processes in such teams and the impact of the use of
              communication technologies on them are important objectives.  Moreover, the
              research will consider the role that each process plays in team effectiveness.
              Psychological processes and behavior at the team and individual levels will be
              examined by means of an ethnographic field study in a large, internationally
              distributed company.  Particular attention will be given to patterns of
              communication, use of communication technologies, and the sharing of contextual
              information. The research seeks to advance science through the development of
              theory and evidence concerning subgroup polarization and collaboration in
              distributed groups, cross-national learning processes in moderately
              heterogeneous international groups, and the impact of these processes on team
              effectiveness.  Envisioned advances also include recommendations 
for the
              design of supporting collaborative technologies.
