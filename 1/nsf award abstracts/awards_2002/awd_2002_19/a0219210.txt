Abstract    :
              This project is at the interface between Information Technology and Nuclear
              Physics. We will develop and apply a two-site data grid at Stony Brook and
              Brookhaven National Laboratory to analysis of heavy ion collisions in the
              PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Collisions at RHIC
              produce many thousands of particles, resulting in enormous volumes of data to
              analyze. In order to study the rare process of gluon scattering at large angle,
              and how the nuclear medium affects this process, we must sift through hundreds
              of millions of these complex events. We will use the software tools developed
              by the Globus collaboration to allow seamless data analysis across two computer
              facilities comprising many computers and terabytes of disk storage. Jobs will
              be automatically directed to the facility where requested data are disk
              resident, and results returned to the user. We will take advantage of many
              developments by others in information technology, but we bring to the table a
              unique mix of real data, eager users, and a cutting edge data grid application
              with a simple demonstration grid of two nearby sites with very similar
              hardware.
Testing and optimizing this prototype grid under "battle" conditions
              will provide information applicable to development of large-scale global data
              grids for the future, as well as physics results from PHENIX.
