Differences in life history traits (growth and
              reproductive rates) among individuals within a species can be explained by the
              existence of tradeoffs that prevent natural selection from optimizing all
              traits in all individuals.  One phenomenon often responsible for generating
              tradeoffs is resource limitation where resources can be allocated to improve
              one trait, e.g. growth rate, or another trait, e.g. reproductive rate, but not
              both.  In plants, one major limiting resource can be fixed carbon, which is
              produced by photosynthesis.  Variation in photosynthesis can result in
              differences in the fixed carbon budget, leading to variation in life history
              traits among individuals.  The goal of this project is to determine the
              relationship between photosynthetic levels and trait variation among individual
              plants.  The study involves measuring photosynthesis and life histories of
              individual plants in controlled and natural environments.

In general,
              linking different fields/approaches often results in synergisms facilitating
              significant scientific advances. The proposed project will train the principal
              investigator to measure photosynthesis and interpret photosynthetic levels
              within the context of life history tradeoffs.  In plants, there are few reports
              on the relationship between photosynthesis and life history, and understanding
              this relationship will provide insight into how plants respond to the
              environment.  The project also allows for undergraduate student participation,
              thus enriching the educational experience of current and future student
              participants in the PI's laboratory.
