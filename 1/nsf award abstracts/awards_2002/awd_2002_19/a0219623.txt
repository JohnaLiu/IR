Abstract    :
              Through this project, the National Science Foundation provides partial funding
              for the acquisition of instrumentation and equipment for the development of a
              Fuel Cell Laboratory in the University of Michigan for Control and Diagnostic
              Systems studies. The experimental set-up allows the implementation of
              multivariable controllers, fault detection, and diagnostic algorithms for the
              regulation of reactant flow and pressure, stack temperature, and membrane
              humidity. It is anticipated that the development and testing of real-time
              control and diagnostic systems will accelerate the use of Fuel Cells by
              enhancing their safety, increasing their efficiency, and ensuring their
              robustness in real world applications.

The equipment acquisition places the
              University of Michigan in a prominent position in FC research. The university's
              strategic location and collaborations with the automotive industry generates
              synergistic mechanisms for research and for training the future technical and
              corporate leaders in the field.
