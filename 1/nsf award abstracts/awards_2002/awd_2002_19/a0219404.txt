Abstract    :
              This is an ITR proposal.  The PI proposes to develop and demonstrate an
              "effective synchronization" of some 35 individual data acquisition systems,
              distributed over distances of several kilometer, to an accuracy of 1-2
              nanoseconds using standard communication protocols.
