Abstract    :
              Behaviorally Situated Avatars for Tutoring: Beyond the Talking Head and Animated
              Icon
Abstract

One-on-one tutoring is a critical component of teaching and
              learning. This project investigates technology to deploy an anywhere-tutor
              anywhere-student system that permits a tutor to provide instruction via an
              animated avatar. Exploiting psycholinguistic information, the system translates
              time-situated pointing and communicative gestures performed on a LCD tablet in
              conjunction with speech into a stream of behaviorally correct, spatially
              situated 3D gestures performed by the avatar tutor.  A camera tracks the
              student, facilitating socially aware behavior by the avatar.  The system
              exploits the student's ability to use body motion cues in the embodied avatar
              to direct her attention to appropriate locations of projected graphics that
              serve as artifacts of instruction.  The technology will potentially facilitate
              a tutoring program in which students may connect to a pool of tutors for help
              with a variety of topics.  The approach essentially implements tutoring
              'telephone handsets' at both ends of the interaction.  Tutors may be
              distributed across multiple sites at their convenience and take calls as they
              are needed. Widespread access to such tutoring will facilitate the vision of
              universally available educational opportunities.  The project will investigate
              the necessary artificial intelligence and interaction technologies and evaluate
              the efficacy of this tutoring methodology.
