Abstract    :
              Main memory has long been the weak link in high-performance Internet-connected
              computer systems, sandwiched between continuing rapid increases in both network
              bandwidths and CPU performance.  As
networks reach 10 Gb/s and CPU clock rates
              shoot past 2 GHz, the memory system is under more pressure than ever to keep
              up.  Meanwhile, increased transistor counts are enabling integration of
              multi-megabyte
caches and DRAM controllers directly on the processor device,
              with switched interconnects built from high-speed point-to-point channels
              carrying I/O and memory coherence traffic between chips.

This inflection
              point in the configuration, level of integration, and capacity of the memory
              hierarchy represents an opportunity to optimize the memory system for
              high-bandwidth Internet networking support.
This research will (1) establish a
              baseline analysis to characterize the key bottlenecks of future memory
              hierarchies on Internet server workloads, and (2) evaluate specific system
              enhancements to address
these bottlenecks, leading to more efficient, higher
              performance Internet server systems.
