Abstract    :
              Novel Imaging Devices for Motion Estimation
Abstract

Advances in both
              imaging sensors and the processing of image data will provide the ability to
              create accurate and detailed models of the world. The numerous applications of
              such a capability have driven a considerable amount of research into the
              problem of extracting structure and motion from image data. While progress has
              been made most of the research to date has concentrated on the use of
              conventional camera technology. The proposed research aims to explore novel
              ways to obtain image data. Optics will be used to manipulate the field of view
              of a conventional lens such that the estimation of motion and structure is
              accurate and robust. The first step of this research is to study the mapping
              from scene rays to image pixels to determine what type of mapping is optimal.
              Next, mirrors, lenses, and other optical devices will be used to build sensors
              that realize these mappings. To take advantage of these new sensors, novel
              computational techniques will also be developed. This research will result in a
              set of new imaging systems for three dimensional modeling and will be useful to
              scientists and engineers in a variety of fields including digital imaging,
              computer graphics, human-computer interaction, and robotics.
