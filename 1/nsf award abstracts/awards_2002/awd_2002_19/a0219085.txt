Abstract    :
              Ensuring the security of today's computer systems is an urgent and
              difficult
problem. The complexity and rapid pace of change in current software
              systems
prevents developers from verifying or auditing the code thoroughly
              enough to
eliminate vulnerabilities. This project seeks to provide security
              defenses
that work in the presence of compromised operating systems and
              applications.
Even if an attacker compromises the operating system, these
              defenses will
continue to ensure their intended security policies.

This new
              level of security is made possible by adding a virtual-machine
              layer
underneath the vulnerable operating system and applications.  This
              additional
software layer enables new security services that do not depend on
              the
integrity of the target software.  This project explores four new
              security
services that can be added via virtual machines: 1) the ability to
              replay
and analyze the complete, instruction-by-instruction execution of a
              computer
system, including actions after the point of compromise; (2) the
              ability to
recover the system to a prior state after an intrusion; (3) the
              ability to
prevent intrusions by safely testing hypothetical "what if"
              scenarios; and (4)
the ability to detect intrusions by monitoring all actions
              of the computer
system.
