Abstract    :
              The long term goal of this research is to investigate whether there is
              compelling or conclusive evidence of computation in stomatal physiology.  
              Stomata are tiny pores on the surfaces of leaves that control CO2 and H2O
              fluxes between the leaf and the atmosphere. Because stomata have the potential
              to interact collectively to process physiological information for the whole
              leaf, the first step in this research is to establish that stomata do indeed
              behave like a connected network.  We will quantify spatial and temporal
              variation in stomatal conductance in Xanthium strumarium L. (cocklebur) using
              chlorophyll fluorescence imaging and mathematical analysis techniques such as
              power spectral analysis, mutual information, and approximate entropy. Sequences
              of images will be analyzed for evidence of various long-range spatial and
              temporal correlations that have been predicted by computer simulations to
              characterize collective networks.

The emergence of complexity from simple
              networks is one of the most intensely investigated areas in contemporary
              science.  Yet, there is no 'real' system in which the details of how this
              emergence occurs have been established.   This research has the potential to do
              so and to provide insight into how information is processed in the biological
              world.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in the
              interdisciplinary fields of experimental biology, dynamical systems, and
              computational science.
