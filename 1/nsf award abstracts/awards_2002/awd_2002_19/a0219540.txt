Abstract    :
              The sheer size of the World-Wide Web mandates the provision of portals,
              hotlists, and other catalogs that organize Web content in a domain-oriented
              manner.  However, the quality of the information contained is subject to
              degradation as content changes, sites reorganize, and host connectivity
              fluctuates.  Simply detecting that a resource has changed is easy, but
              determining whether that change is significant requires understanding of the
              context in which the resource is used.  This project will improve the stability
              of collections of Web pages, allowing the development of predictable
              collections that overcome the inherent instability of the World-Wide 
Web.  To
              accomplish this goal, the project will investigate the applicability of
              semantic descriptors provided by collection creators and implicit contextual
              information extracted from the collection.
