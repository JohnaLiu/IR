Title:
              Simulation-Based Operations Planning for Regional Transportation Systems

   
               This grant will support the development and application of high performance
              modeling and simulation techniques and tools to design and manage regional
              transportation systems. Tools will be developed to integrate forecasted travel
              demands with detail micro-level simulation of the transportation infrastucture;
              the intention is to enable more reliable projections of transportation system
              behavior. A reservation system will be developed to help manage traveler
              demands, rather than simply responding to individual traveler's priorities.
