Abstract    :
              The explosive demand for communication services, fueled by the
rapid growth in
              the areas of mobile communications and the
Internet, has generated and will
              continue to generate immense
research efforts in the area of wideband
              wired/wireless
communications. To accommodate the demanding future
              applications,
systems must be designed to perform joint equalization,
              detection,
decoding and estimation of the unknown and possibly time
              varying
channel parameters, while maintaining reasonable complexity (and
low
              cost). Motivated by these requirements, and using an OFDM
indoor wireless
              system as a design example, two main directions
are investigated in this
              project.

In the first direction, receiver algorithms are designed
              for
iterative, joint equalization, detection and decoding, that
address the
              critical issues mentioned above. The investigation
starts by identifying a
              powerful model that encompasses all the
salient features of the OFDM
              transmission system. Data detection
in OFDM is then stated as a problem of
              two-dimensional (2D) data
detection in the presence of localized, 2D
              intersymbol
interference, non-linear distortion, and unknown and time
              varying
parameters. We then identify fast, joint data detection and
channel
              estimation schemes which are utilized as building blocks
for powerful adaptive
              iterative detection receivers. Unlike the
entire iterative receiver, these
              sub-blocks are optimal in a
precisely defined sense, and can be implemented
              with
less-than-exponential complexity with respect to the data
              sequence
length.

The second direction is the development of a unified
              framework for
the analysis of the transient and steady-state behavior
              of
adaptive iterative algorithms. In the proposed study, the receiver
is
              assumed to have no explicit knowledge about the channel
parameters, other than
              their statistical description. The minimum
signal-to-noise ratio required for
              convergence to error-free
transmission, and the optimal allocation of power in
              pilot and
coded symbols, are some of the issues that are investigated for
              a
wide variety of adaptive iterative receiver architectures.
Regarding
              propagation modeling for the indoor environment, the
approach followed herein
              is a direct divergence from the classical
approaches that include either
              measurements, or the
well-established ray-tracing techniques. In particular,
              ultra-fast
algorithms for the numerical solution of the
              electromagnetic
problem are developed. These algorithms result in almost
              exact
solutions that can be evaluated with complexity comparable to the
less
              accurate ray-tracing techniques.
