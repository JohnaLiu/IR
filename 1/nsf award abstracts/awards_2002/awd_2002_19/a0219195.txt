Abstract    :
              This NSF/CONACyT grant provides funding for the University of Texas at Arlington
              (UTA) to work with the Centro de Investigaciones y de Estudios Avanzados del
              IPN Unidad Guadalajara (CINVESTAV) and the Universidad Autonoma de Ciudad
              Juarez (UACJ) to carry out collaborative research in Flexible Manufacturing
              Systems (FMS) control and implementation of novel Discrete Event (DE)
              Supervisory Controllers over the internet.  By combining current results and
              developing new results by joint research, this research will develop an
              integrated approach to FMS design, decision-making, and on-line supervisory DE
              control.

There are two goals in this NSF/CONACyT research:  1) Structure and
              performance of DE supervisory controllers for manufacturing systems using UTA's
              patented matrix-based discrete event controller as a tool to perform high-level
              design of supervisory controllers for manufacturing systems and improve
              dispatching, routing, and part release; study bottlenecks and optimal dynamic
              rebalancing of jobs to alleviate bottlenecks; design, and study the performance
              and complexity of, distributed decentralized supervisory controllers for
              multiple networked cellular manufacturing workcells; and 2) improve academic
              and broader impact goals by offering a summer course at UTA for formal training
              on the analysis and design of DE controllers for undergraduate and graduate
              students from USA and Mexico; involve local high school students in course
              projects on actual manufacturing and robotic systems; jointly co-advise Mexican
              Ph.D. students, including visits to UTA for research and development; design
              and develop an internet-based supervisory control system for manufacturing
              workcells; and set up a distance-learning program over the internet to train
              Mexican students to program workcells.  Also, the research will work on
              industrial partner chemical flowline implementation by designing a chemical
              processing flowline for aircraft parts for an industrial partner, designing a
              DE supervisory controller for part routing and resource assignment, and
              simulate various strategies for part routing and resource assignment.  The
              automated, dynamically controlled chemical flow line is a new concept in
              aircraft manufacturing that has the potential to gain significant market share
              in a new industry.
