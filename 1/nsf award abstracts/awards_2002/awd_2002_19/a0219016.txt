Title: ITR SMALL: Invariant Detection and
              Interpretation of Specific Objects in Image Data

The area of investigation
              is automated scene analysis. The main objective is to detect the appearance in
              image data of objects from a small repertoire. Two key liabilities in current
              methods are insufficient invariance, both photometric and geometric, and
              inefficient computation. To confront these difficulties, a unified statistical
              and computational framework is proposed which is based on a coarse-to-fine
              sequence of approximations to a full Bayesian model. Research topics include
              both algorithmic and mathematical issues arising in coarse-to-fine search,
              model selection and deformable shape analysis. 

The interpretation of
              natural scenes is effortless for human beings but is the main challenge of
              artificial vision. This "semantic gap" has largely resisted any satisfying
              solution and impedes scientific and technological advances in many areas,
              including automated medical diagnosis, industrial automation, and effective
              security and surveillance. The general objective of this project is to design
              computer algorithms for detecting and interpreting certain objects appearing in
              still pictures in order to relieve humans of wearisome visual search tasks in
              medical imaging, law enforcement, industrial inspection and everyday life
