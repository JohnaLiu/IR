Abstract    :
              The educational system can be viewed as a dynamic environment influenced by many
              factors.  In this project a multi-agent interaction and simulation model will
              be investigated as a tool for evaluating educational systems as dynamic
              environments.  The long term aim of the tool will be to model the interaction
              between education policy and human learning by first using typically measured
              factors such as test scores and economic status and they exploring other
              factors that are harder to quantify but which may result in a more accurate
              model. The proposed work involved three phases: (1) constructing an initial
              model and calibrating it against historical data; (2) examining how other, less
              typical characteristics can be quantified and expanding the model to include
              these additional measures; and (3) introducing the model to education policy
              makers, building a user-interface that they can use and understand; and
              conducting a pilot study with potential users. The research team consists of
              computer scientists, dynamical system theorists, multi-agent researchers,
              school system experts, and AI researchers.
