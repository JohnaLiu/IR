Abstract    :
              Advances in earth sciences have spurred a large growth in spatial-
temporal
              databases with multidimensional attributes. Unfortunately, the
improvement in
              data collection techniques has not been accompanied
with the efficient methods
              that analyze large databases, which currently
limits their use. To address the
              need for facilitating large-scale
knowledge discovery at a wide range of
              spatial-temporal datasets the
objective of the proposed project is development
              of novel techniques
for (1) task-specific data reduction in spatial-temporal
              databases; and
(2) efficient knowledge discovery on reduced spatial-temporal
              data.
The first task builds on the observation that the amount of collected
              data
is not necessarily correlated with specific knowledge discovery
              tasks,
and that real-life datasets are often highly redundant. The second
              task
addresses a number of open questions for more efficient mining
              of
reduced spatial-temporal datasets including exploring trade-offs
between
              model complexity and data reduction for efficient learning,
exploiting
              residual correlations for prediction, and task-specific
partitioning of
              nonstationary spatial-temporal data. The proposed
techniques will be evaluated
              on multi-source datasets with various
complexities. This project will result
              in guidelines for effective
dissemination of spatial-temporal data sets to
              wider research audience
and algorithmic tools for more successful knowledge
              discovery from such
data.
