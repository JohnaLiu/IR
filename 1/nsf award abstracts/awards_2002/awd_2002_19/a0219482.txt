Abstract    :
              This project will carry out the research needed to update a classic publication
              entitled, Designing for Earthquakes, originally published in 1978.  One of the
              few technical documents that dealt with seismic design for members of the
              architecture profession, this publication is now out of print.  The new
              document will improve vastly on the earlier publication by incorporating
              advances that have been made in engineering knowledge and the development of
              the concept of Performance Based Seismic Design.  The absence of technical
              seismic design information for architects has ignored the pivotal role they
              play in communicating seismic resistant strategies to building owners and
              community leaders.  EERI will carry out the necessary research to gain a better
              understanding of the current status and limitations of seismic design education
              in university architecture and continuing education programs, identify the
              kinds of information and training that architects need to better understand and
              design for specific seismic performance levels, update the chapters of the 1978
              publication, and finally, add several new chapters that reflect current
              engineering research and topics that were not considered two decades ago.  The
              final publication will enable architects to play a significant role in
              designing 
a safer society.
