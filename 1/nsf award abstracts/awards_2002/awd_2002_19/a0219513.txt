Abstract    :
              There are many different sources from which relevant information can
              be
obtained for an intelligence task at hand, such as an analysis of
              operations
planning by Al Qaeda.  The accuracy of this information is
              frequently
imperfect.   

Information obtained from each source is
              frequently also different in
structure and scope. XML has emerged today as the
              standard for information exchange.  Its
flexibility permits the representation
              of information from heterogeneous
sources in a single unified
              framework.

The goal of this project is to manage uncertain (probabilistic)
              data,
represented in XML.  While there have been previous efforts to
              develop
probabilistic relational systems, the need for representing and
              querying
uncertain information is much greater for loosely structured data not
              
readily amenable to a relational representation.

XML data poses several
              modeling challenges that are the focus of this
project: due to the data having
              (an inclusion hierarchy) structure,
probabilities cannot be assigned
              independently; due to XML elements occurring
at multiple granularities,
              probabilities may be assigned at multiple levels;
due to the possibility of
              missing and repeated sub-elements, one may not be
able to obtain complete
              distributions.
