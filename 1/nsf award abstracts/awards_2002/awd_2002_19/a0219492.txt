Abstract    :
              This project will build information retrieval interfaces for the
              rapidly
expanding but virtually unstudied domain of biodiversity databases.
              An
understanding of the nature and magnitude of biological diversity is
              fundamental to most pressing environmental and conservation debates. 
              Biodiversity databases contain organism-related information such as
              distribution, taxonomy, natural history, and conservation data.  This project
              will combine information visualization techniques and rapid feedback dynamic
              query interfaces coupled with an aggressive approach of working with
              representative users at all levels, from design through evaluation.  It will
              also utilize zoomable interfaces to allow users to navigate multiple
              hierarchies, in order to visually accommodate highly interconnected data.  The
              goals of the project are: 
  * To develop a searching interface for
              biodiversity databases 
    targeting domain-novice adults. 
  * To build
              interfaces combining "folk" and "scientific" understanding. 
  * To evaluate
              the developed interfaces and compare them to existing 
    interface models in
              the biodiversity domain.
