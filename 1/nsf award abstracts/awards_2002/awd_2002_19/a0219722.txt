This proposal addresses some important
              components in the theoretical and algorithmic signal processing machinery
              needed to make low-power, ubiquitous sensor networks a reality. The physical
              and hardware attributes as well as the computing and communication capabilities
              of these low-power, low-cost sensors, particularly those based on high-density
              MEMS devices, have the potential to revolutionize next-generation information
              technology. Indeed, next-generation MEMs sensors are expected to be very cheap
              and very small (of the order of one millimeter cube) with a communication range
              of several hundred meters and a bandwidth of tens to hundreds of kilobits per
              second. The challenge is to build a pervasive, reliable, mas-sively
              distributed, dynamically self-conguring dense sensor network system out of
              these low-cost, ubiquitous devices. While the hardware and computational
              infrastructure are following Moore's law, the system-level expertise in terms
              of both theoretical and algorithmic knowledge-base needed to fully harness the
              potential of this infrastructure is sadly lagging behind. 
The challenges
              presented by these networks are far beyond existing theories and algorithms,
              and in many cases require a fundamental paradigm shift from centralized to
              distributed architectures. This proposal is accordingly motivated at developing
              some important components of the signal processing and communication system
              machinery needed to make this dream a reality.
