Title: "ITR:
              Co-constucting scientific understanding by integrating the social and the
              cognitive mechanisms of learning through shared, active representatives in
              interdisciplinary context."

      This project involves the development and
              testing of an effective instructional methodology for software-supported,
              shared, active knowledge construction that is portable to a variety of science
              courses at different levels of student experience. The research focuses on the
              interface of cognition, collaboration and representational guidance and draws
              attention to issues that are universal in all interdisciplinary, scientific
              inquiry settings centered on enhancing understandingof technologically and
              methodologically sound ways to reach underrepresented groups and perform
              cross-cultural, collaborative problem solving activities over distances. Using
              software tools developed under separate funding, the project involves a
              rigorous experimental study of the mechanisms of cognitive change that are
              embedded in the social circumstances of learning. With the participation of
              high school teachers, college students and high school students, the project
              will contribute to understanding of (a)the function of peer audience to foster
              learning, (b)the most effective methods of technological support for
              communication between local and distal peers and (c) congnitively-guided
              pedagogies that are effective in enriching the learning experiences of students
              in various technological and instructional setting and in underrepresented
              regions and cultures. The project is geographically located in an urban setting
              with a large minority and under-represented population and involves college
              students, high school teachers, high school students and international
              collaboration. The outcome of the project will be a practical approach for
              effective pedagogies to elicit active learning in complex, interdisciplinary
              and technology driven environments that are expected to prevail in the 21st
              century.
