Abstract    :
              Existing methods to validate mobile code integrity and author authentication
              include using certificates, encrypting the code, and using digital signatures
              to sign applications. This proposal addresses the challenge of providing users
              with a system that can overcome the weaknesses of certificates (which require
              additional bandwidth) and conventional signatures (which can be removed)
              without becoming as obtrusive as encrypted code. This research proposes a novel
              approach in which the code serves as its own authentication device. The overall
              goal of this proposed research is to develop both the foundations and a
              unifying framework for ensuring integrity and authentication of mobile code,
              and then to build a prototype environment consisting of a set of automatic
              tools that embody the developed techniques.
The results will be:
(1)
              techniques for statically analyzing mobile code representations to efficiently
              compute a tamper detection mark and to embed, extract, and validate the mark,
              
(2) static analysis techniques for generating a unique program fingerprint to
              be used as a less stringent form of tamper detection and for intellectual
              property protection, 
(3) a suite of platform-independent tools that automate
              the process of ensuring integrity and authentication for mobile code, 
(4)
              thorough experimental evaluation of the developed techniques, and 
(5)
              increased participation of undergraduates in experimental computer
science
              research, with particular attention to encouraging 
the pursuit of graduate
              education and women in computer
science.
This proposed research represents a
              significant step towards ensuring high confidence in the integrity of mobile
              code, which is becoming a major component of software systems exploiting the
              Internet.
