Abstract    :
              This collaborative research project aims at advancing information
technologies
              related to the preservation, retrieval, and dissemination
of digital imagery
              for Asian art and cultural heritages.  Researchers
in the US, China, and South
              Korea will collectively investigate and
develop technologies for acquiring,
              browsing, managing, and searching
large collections of high quality art
              images.  This project will
contribute to the fundamental knowledge and
              technologies required to
create and maintain information systems that can
              operate in multiple
languages, formats, media, and social and organizational
              contexts.
The US research team will focus on (1) multimodal media
              management,
(2) distributed data mining, and (3) image storage and display. 
              The team
will develop theoretical foundations to associate linguistic
              terms
with image features.  The testbed databases of art images for
              this
research project consist of high quality scans, with
              metadata
information and detailed keyword information, as well as
              comprehensive
textual descriptions.  The research work will show that (1)
              modern
machine learning and statistical data mining tools are capable
              of
learning from non-structured or semi-structured input data such as
human
              annotations, (2) statistical image modeling techniques can be
used in
              automatic linguistic indexing and concept dictionary building.
