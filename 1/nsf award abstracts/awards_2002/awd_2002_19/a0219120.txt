Abstract    :
              The project will investigate the impact of mesoscale motions on climate through
              careful analysis of extended integrations of a state-of-the-art model having
              very high horizontal and vertical resolution.  Key issues in
              tropospheric-stratospheric dynamics, including interaction of very disparate
              scales of motion, will be addressed.  Interest in more accurate modeling of the
              stratospheric circulation has recently been rekindled by observational analysis
              that suggests that a primary mode of tropospheric variability in the high
              latitudes is influenced by the downward migration of annular anomalies from the
              stratosphere.  Dr. Hamilton will conduct a dynamically oriented diagnostic
              analysis of the high-resolution general circulation model (GCM) integrations
              completed at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, Princeton.  The
              objective will be to understand the role of small-scale processes, including
              gravity waves generated in the troposphere by deep convection, in the evolution
              and maintenance of the stratospheric general circulation.  This research will
              lead to improved parameterization of small-scale processes in global climate
              models, and advance the understanding and modeling of dynamical interactions of
              the troposphere and stratosphere.
