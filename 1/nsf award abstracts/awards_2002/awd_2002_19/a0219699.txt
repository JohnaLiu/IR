Abstract    :
              Development of high throughput data acquisition technologies together with
              advances in computing, and communications have resulted in an explosive growth
              in the number, size, and diversity of potentially useful information sources.
              However, the massive size, heterogeneity, autonomy, and distributed nature of
              the data repositories present significant hurdles in extracting knowledge from
              this data. This research seeks to overcome these hurdles through the design,
              analysis, and implementation of:
a) Efficient distributed and cumulative
              learning algorithms with provable performance guarantees (relative to their
              centralized or batch counterparts) for knowledge acquisition from distributed
              data sources;
b) Customizable information extraction agents that can
              effectively exploit domain or context-specific ontologies supplied by the users
              to extract the information needed for learning (e.g., statistics) from
              distributed data sources despite differences in query capabilities, interfaces,
              ontologies, and access restrictions to facilitate analysis of heterogeneous
              distributed data from different perspectives.
c) INDUS - a test-bed for
              knowledge acquisition from heterogeneous distributed data in computational
              molecular biology (e.g., characterization of protein
              sequence-structure-function relationships using diverse sources of biological
              data).

The resulting algorithms and software can accelerate, potentially by
              an order of magnitude, the rate of scientific
