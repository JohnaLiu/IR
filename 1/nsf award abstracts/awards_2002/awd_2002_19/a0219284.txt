Abstract    :
              This project is aimed at how to create and use elementary mathematics diagnostic
              tools in classroom contexts. An established diagnostic framework, the
              Diagnostic Test of Arithmetic Skills, that enables teachers to assess students'
              procedural and conceptual approaches to mathematical problem-solving.

The
              specific goals of the project are to:

Revise, modify, and update the
              Diagnostic Test of Arithmetic Skills to bring it into alignment with the most
              current research on mathematics teaching and learning.

Build a mathematics
              diagnostic application focused on multiplication, a content areas that is
              pedagogically and conceptually complex

Identify the required professional
              development supports, and build prototype materials for the multiplication
              application

Conduct research studies on the reliability of the diagnostic
              tool and on whether the use of the tool affects teachers' thinking about
              mathematics and instruction.
