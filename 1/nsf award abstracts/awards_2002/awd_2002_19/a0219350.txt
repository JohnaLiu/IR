Abstract    :
              This project will advance understanding of how information technology is
              perceived, used, and reconfigured in diverse cultures in Central Asia. By
              conducting an empirical investigation into the cultural factors that affect
              information technology adoption, and articulating which of these elements are
              most significant in determining the success rate of IT initiatives, the
              research will provide a blueprint that can be used by programs delivering
              IT-related programs in disparate settings. The research will focus on Central
              Asia because of that region's unique combination of infrastructure and literacy
              combined with relatively low exposure to Western culture and early stages of
              Internet adoption. The project will draw on qualitative and quantitative
              methods, using survey instruments, statistical analysis, coded interview data,
              and ethnographic observation. Surveys will be developed based on previous
              research, and they will be distributed at Internet access sites in Central
              Asia. Interviews will also be conducted in Central Asia. The survey and
              interview data will be analyzed in an effort to correlate usage habits with
              local cultural factors. As information technology becomes increasingly
              important, effective implementation becomes even more critical. This project
              will make a significant contribution to understanding how culture affects
              technology adoption, thus advancing broad-based approaches to bridging the
              digital divide.
