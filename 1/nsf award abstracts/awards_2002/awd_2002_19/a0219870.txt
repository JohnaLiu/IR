The thesis of this project
              is very simple: the performance of garbage collection is critical to the
              successful deployment of distributed Java embedded systems. Applications for
              such systems have different operating requirements than applications written
              for desktop or server environments. They include frequent software update, low
              power consumption, low resource availability, distributed computing capability,
              and real-time operating constraints. Therefore, garbage collectors for such
              devices must be designed to support those requirements. 

Garbage Collection
              (GC), or automatic dynamic memory management, is one of the many attractive
              features available in Java. It allows programmer to be more productive and
              software to be more robust. On the other hand, it is also notorious for being
              intrusive and consuming large amount of power due to frequent memory accesses.
              As a result, the garbage collection can severely degrade the performance and
              affect the viability of Java embedded devices.
