Abstract    :
              RCS structures consisting of reinforced concrete columns and steel beams are a
              cost-effective type of construction in seismic zones. Models for RCS joints
              have been restricted to either strength models or monotonic force-deformation
              models based on experimental results. The behavior of joints typically
              encountered in frame structures, such as connections with strong outer panels
              and T-configurations, is not well known. Inelastic behavior of connections with
              strong outer panels could significantly differ from that of joints with strong
              inner panel. Bearing failures might represent a threat in T-joints because of
              the lack of a column section above the connection. Macro models that simulate
              the behavior of RCS connections in shear and bearing for performance-based
              design will be developed based on new and existing experimental and analytical
              results. These models will include the effect of confinement, concrete
              softening, and relative strength contribution from shear resistance mechanisms
              on hysteretic response of RCS joints.
