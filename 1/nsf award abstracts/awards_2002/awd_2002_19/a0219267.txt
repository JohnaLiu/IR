Abstract    :
              Peter Pulay and Amy Apon of the University of Arkansas are supported by the
              Chemistry Division  through the Information Technology Research program in a
              collaborative effort between theoretical chemistry and computer science.  They
              will develop quantum chemical methods and the supporting cluster software
              necessary for efficient execution on low-cost parallel hardware.  The first
              effort in this project is the development of a computer program for correlated
              electronic structure calculations for large molecules on parallel computers. 
              The second effort is the development of fault-tolerant parallel file system
              tools for large-scale scientific calculations.

The broader impacts of this
              work include production of general-purpose tools for optimizing file and disk
              access for a variety of long-running large scale applications on low-cost
              parallel architectures.
