BARTNESS, TIMOTHY

Animals in nature must forage for food to
              help pay their energy debts.  Once they find a food source, the food found has
              three fates. First, it can be eaten and the energy used immediately if they
              have an immediate energy debt to pay. Alternatively, if no immediate need
              exists, the energy can be stored as body fat. Finally, it can be brought to
              their homes and stored as a food hoard. Little is know about what drives the
              animals to forage for food, in terms of underlying brain or hormonal factors,
              or what causes them to eat and burn the calories, eat and store the calories as
              fat, or hoard the food for later consumption. The purpose of the first
              experiments is to test some brain chemicals that control these fates of the
              foraged food, as well as foraging itself by applying them to the brain.  The
              purpose of the second experiments is to test whether changes in body fat affect
              foraging, food hoarding and food eaten by experimentally removing or adding
              body fat and measuring these responses.  How animals acquire, use and store
              food energy is a fundamental problem in the regulatory biology of all
              species.
