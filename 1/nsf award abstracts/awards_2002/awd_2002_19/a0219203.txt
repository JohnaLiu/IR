Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a group from the University of Wisconsin to
              develop a portal to facilitate the seamless access to the world-wide grid with
              computers that are not specially configured for the use of a particular
              project. The techniques developed will have general applicability to various
              computing intensive projects, including the high energy physics experiment CMS
              (at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Switzerland). It will leverage the tools
              developed by the GriPhyN (Grid Physics Network), iVDGL (international Virtual
              Grid Laboratory) and the PPDG (Particle Physics Data Grid) projects.

The
              proposed activities are to develop an object IO model that allows local caching
              and organized streaming of data to central servers; to adapt a CMS simulation
              program to take advantage of an abundance of CPU resources; and to establish an
              on-demand CMS simulation facility using the above items. The deliverables will
              be implemented in such a way that generalization to other projects is possible
              and the validated software tools will be made freely available.
