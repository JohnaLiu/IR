ITR: Development of
              novel computational methods for genome-wide discovery of gene function and
              networks

Of the roughly 40,000 genes encoded by the human genome, as with
              every other genome sequenced to date, about half are completely uncharacterized
              and of unknown function. There is a broad need for methods to discover the
              functions of these thousands of uncharacterized genes, as well as how the gene
              products participate in networks, pathways and systems in the cell. This
              project's goal is to develop novel computational methods for discovering the
              functions of genes on a genome-wide scale, and to discover how the genes are
              organized into systems and pathways. Several novel methods are proposed capable
              of providing such information. The essence of these methods, called
              "non-homology" methods, is that they analyze contextual properties of
              genes-such as which organisms the genes appear in, which genes can be found
              fused together, and other properties-in addition to the sequences of the genes.
              Such contextual properties turn out to provide a tremendous increase in the
              ability of computational methods to discover gene function and gene networks.
              At the core of this proposal is a novel graph-based method for associating
              genes together that operate in the same cellular pathway, essentially resulting
              in a "functional map" of the genes.  This method is combined with a new
              computational method for finding specific physical interaction partners for
              proteins in large sequence families, and with methods to visualize the
              resultant complex gene networks.  Application of these methods should improve
              our understanding of the functions of the thousands of uncharacterized genes in
              each sequenced genome.
