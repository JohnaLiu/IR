Abstract    :
              Bastain Braams of the Courant Institute at NYU and Joel Bowman of Emory
              University are supported by the Chemistry Division  through the Information
              Technology Research program in a collaborative effort between theoretical
              chemistry and mathematics.  They will develop and apply dynamic,
              high-dimensional interpolation and approximation methods, combined with a
              sparse grid dimension reduction approach, to first-principles molecular
              dynamics calculations.  Applications guiding the project come from chemical
              kinetics and reaction dynamics, and especially combustion.  The methods and
              codes under development will have broad applicability in quantum chemistry and
              in high-dimensional function fitting and optimization.

This project
              addresses a challenging and multi-faceted problem in scientifc computing, and
              combines research and research training in numerical analysis and computational
              chemistry.  The computer codes developed herein will be useful to other areas
              of computational science, and will be written and documented for wide
              dissemination.
