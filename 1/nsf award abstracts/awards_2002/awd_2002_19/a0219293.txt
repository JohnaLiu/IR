Satellite radar interferometry (InSAR)
              provides earth-surface deformation measurements at finer resolution and greater
              spatial coverage than any other traditional geodetic technique and has quickly
              developed into a critical tool for measurement of deformation associated with
              natural and anthropogenic hazards.  The routine production of InSAR
              measurements is a consequence of the general availability of InSAR processing
              software with each package producing the same general final product - the
              differential interferogram.  Although recent InSAR research has considered the
              ensemble use of tens of interferograms to reveal complex and subtle surface
              deformation, a post-processing software package is not readily available to the
              InSAR geoscience community.  This project involves the research and development
              of an InSAR post-processing software toolkit employing three general strategies
              missing from current InSAR software: mosaicking of multiple satellite tracks
              for complete surface displacement measurement, interferogram stacking for noise
              reduction, and InSAR time-series analysis for measurement of continuous,
              non-uniform deformation.  The software is modular, coded in C and Fortran,
              called from a series of Unix-based shell scripts and developed generally
              independent of the InSAR software used to generate the differential
              interferograms.  Where processor-specific information is required, the software
              is integrated with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ROI_PAC software package. 
              Distribution of the post-processing toolkit is through a GNU General Public
