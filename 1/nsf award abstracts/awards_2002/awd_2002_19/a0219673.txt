Events,
              Patterns, and Analysis: Forecasting International Conflict in the Twenty-First
              Century
       
This grant will support work on international conflict
              prediction using techniques such as data mining, statistical machine learning,
              and stochastic modeling. News data from such sources as Reuters, AP, cnn.com,
              and UPI will be used to extract data about political events. Each event will
              code with a time, list of participants and other standardized characteristics
              to support the analysis and forecasting.
