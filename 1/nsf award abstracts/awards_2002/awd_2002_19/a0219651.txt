              ABSTRACT

OCE-0219651


A PI from Oregon State University plans to test the
              hypothesis that during authigenic uptake Mo isotopes are fractionated with the
              lighter isotopes being preferentially taken up relative to the heavy isotopes
              leaving behind a residual (dissolved) Mo pool that  is isotopically heavy
              relative to seawater.  To prove the hypothesis, the PI will analyze existing
              near surface (top 20 cm) porewater and sediment samples from the Peru/Chile
              margin and the California margin for 98Mo and 95Mo to assess the early
              diagenetic behavior of Mo.  In addition, a cruise is planned to the Santa
              Barbara Basin, CA, to collect and analyze deeper sediment and porewater samples
              from a region where sediments are exposed to continuously changing redox
              conditions.  Results from these samples will determine under what conditions
              molybdenum isotopes fractionate and whether this fractionation is preserved in
              the sedimentary record.  This information will help determine whether this
              isotope can be used as a proxy for identifying reducing conditions in
              sediments.
