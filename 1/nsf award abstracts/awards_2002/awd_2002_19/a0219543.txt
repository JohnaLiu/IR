This exploratory syudy aims to assess the relevance of two
              perspectives policy dynamics and policy learning for understanding domestic
              policy changes for the Arctic. Specifically, the political science team will
              assess whether the construction of a Canadian database capable of monitoring
              public change relevant to the Canadian North is feasible and whether a policy
              learning prspective can be applied to the study will consist of examination of
              the potential quantitative data sources for Arctic policy monitoring in Canada
              and some field travel to gain understanding of policy networks in the Canadian
              setting.
