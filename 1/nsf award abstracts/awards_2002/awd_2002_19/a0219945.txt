Abstract    :
              The project aims to improve the robustness of XML-based software systems using
              static typing.  The primary goal is the design, formal analysis, and
              implementation of a new programming language called Xtatic-- a lightweight and
              completely inter-operatable extension of a mainstream object-oriented language,
              with native support for statically checked XLM processing.

The key
              technology underlying the project is REGULAR EXPRESSION TYPES.  The basic
              constructors of regular expression types ( union, concatenation, repetition,
              etc.) are similiar to those of existing XML schema formalisms.  In a language
              with regular expression types, however, XML trees become built-in values of the
              language and the static analysis of the shapes of built-in value of the
              language and the static analysis of the shapes of trees that may appear at run
              time ( as values of variables, parameters to methods, result of complex
              expressions, or structued messages sent across the network)becomes part of the
              ordinary work of typechecking.
