Abstract    :
              The recent and growing popularity of thin-client systems makes it
important to
              develop techniques for analyzing and comparing their
performance, to assess
              the general feasibility of the thin-client
computing model in modern
              networking environments, and to determine
the factors that govern the
              performance of these architectures. 
This project involves carrying out a
              series of experiments to gain
information and understanding on the
              effectiveness of thin-client
architectural mechanisms for graphical and
              multimedia applications in
various network environments.  These experiments
              include performance
analysis using several real applications as well as
              controlled
experiments with specialized micro-benchmarks designed to
              isolate
particular aspects of thin-client architectures that have
              significant
impact on overall application performance. Application and
              user
workloads will be varied to understand and analyze the scalability
              of
different remote display mechanisms in terms of network and
              server
resources.  These experiments will be conducted in a
              testbed
environment in which network characteristics such as
              bandwidth,
latency, and packet loss are varied in a controlled manner
              to
understand their impact on thin-client architectural design
choices.  The
              results of these experiments will have a fundamental
scientific impact by
              laying a quantitative foundation for future
innovations in thin-client
              computing research.
