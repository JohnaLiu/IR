Abstract    :
              ITR: Communication in the presence of noise 
     and Algorithms for
              error-correction 

PI: Madhu Sudan, MIT

The increased reliance of
              information technology in our
day-to-day life has resulted in an explosion in
              the amount 
of data that is stored in digital media and transmitted over
the
              internet. Associated with the increased amount of storage are
increased
              expectations: Over communication channels, one hopes to 
be able to transmit
              more information, faster; and on storage media
one hopes to store more
              information, cheaply and for longer periods 
of time. However, all channels
              introduce noise
over time and corrupt the stored/transmitted information.
The
              task of coping with errors in the new information technology 
era leads to new
              challenges and a resurgence of some of the
classical ones.  This research
              project investigates foundational
questions and designs solutions for some of
              these challenges,
with special focus on the following directions:

    A
              systematic study of ``list-decoding'' algorithms
       as an approach to push
              the limits of error-correction.
    A worst-case approach to information
              theory to capture 
       more general models of error.
    A reexamination
              of classical models of communication from 
       a new
              (algorithmic/asymptotic) perspective.
