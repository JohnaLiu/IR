Abstract    :
              Twin photons have provided quantum optics with one of its most powerful tools to
              explore phenomena such as particle entanglement and the idea of teleportation
              of information, with additional glimpses of possible applications to quantum
              computation. Addition of angular momentum (AM) entanglement to the conjugated
              photon system in the parametric down conversion (PDC) process could extend
              entanglement to an unprecedented degree.  It is the aim of this work to extend
              the fundamental knowledge on twin photons with angular momentum, which is in
              its early stages, and to determine the possibility of applications of these new
              ideas to Quantum Information Science. The specific plans include the following.
              1) A coincidence experiment to confirm the angular correlations of entangled
              photons with angular momentum that have been predicted theoretically will be
              performed. 2) A second coincidence experiment will be done as a test for a
              possible application in optical fibers.  3)  Light states entangled both in
              angular momentum and polarization will be created by a combination of path
              indistinguishability to produce multi-entanglement between entangled
              polarization states and entangled angular momentum states.  The experimental
              efforts will be accompanied by theoretical studies.
