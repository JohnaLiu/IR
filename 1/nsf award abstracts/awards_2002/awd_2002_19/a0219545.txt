Abstract    :
              Reducing energy consumption is a key challenge in the design of modern
              microprocessors.  Until recently, the primary source of energy dissipation in
              CMOS microprocessors has been the dynamic switching of load capacitances, but
              with continuing reductions in feature size and the accompanying reductions in
              threshold voltage, static leakage power is increasing exponentially.  Most
              leakage power is dissipated on critical paths, especially after slower,
              low-leakage transistors are used on non-critical paths.  To reduce leakage
              energy further, it is necessary to dynamically deactivate the fast leaky
              transistors on critical paths when they are not needed.

This project is
              developing fine-grain dynamic leakage reduction techniques, whereby small
              pieces of an active processor are put to sleep for short periods of time.  The
              project is investigating circuit-level leakage reduction technique that have
              low sleep transition energy and rapid wakeup times, together with
              micro-architectural and compiler techniques that increase the sleep time of
              micro-architectural components without impacting performance or dynamic power
              dissipation.  Accurate static power models that capture the sleep-time
              dependence of leakage energy are being developed for use with architectural
              simulators.  This work enables a new class of limited critical activity
              architectures, where fast but power hungry logic can be selectively enabled to
              speed critical paths while limiting overall power consumption.
