Abstract    :
              Continuing support via the Woods Hole Oceanographic  Institution will permit
              U.S. ocean scientists in the academic research community to participate in
              specific activities of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea
              (ICES) and the Scientific Committee for Oceanic Research (SCOR). These
              activities are of particular interest to the ocean sciences community and the
              National Science Foundation. ICES is an  intergovernmental organization that
              coordinates data and information exchange regarding scientific research,
              management of fisheries, environmental  monitoring, and oceanographic research
              matters that are of common interest to countries bordering the North Atlantic.
              SCOR serves primarily as an organization to facilitate international
              collaboration of ocean research through the formation of working groups and
              publication of findings on various marine topics.  Under this award U.S.
              academic research scientists will participate in selected ICES and SCOR
              activities in 2002-2004.
