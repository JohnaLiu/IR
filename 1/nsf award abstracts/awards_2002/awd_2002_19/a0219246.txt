Development of computer-aided stereographic projection
              techniques has greatly aided interpretation of Earth Science structure and
              processes. We have developed and implemented an affordable PC/Linux based
              stereo projection system ("the Geowall") that can be used by individual
              research groups and within the undergraduate curriculum.  The main goals of
              this collaborative Information Technology Research project between the
              University of Michigan and the University of Illinois at Chicago (EAR-0218918;
              PI: A. Johnson) are to greatly improve the content development and delivery for
              Earth Science applications. This will include the development of conversion
              software and viewers for existing Earth Science applications; implementation of
              tools for interaction and manipulation of 3D data; testing of these tools in
              Earth Science departments; improvement of the collaborative environment for
              work between groups of researchers; and dissemination through the Geowall
              consortium (geowall.org).
