Abstract    :
              Tracking social agents that have a variety of mental states is quite different
              from and more challenging than tracking more predictable systems, say aircraft
              or ships.  While multi-target tracking systems typically use physics-based
              models to track maneuvering vehicles, this work centers on developing
              probabilistic models of behavior and mental state to address the effects of
              interactions between agents. This work has practical applications in many areas
              including, for example: monitoring crowds of people, analyzing urban traffic
              patterns, and understanding robot and human team behavior. Additionally, this
              work should accelerate progress in experimental behavioral ecology, especially
              in the study of social insect systems.  For this reason the investigation will
              initially be conducted in collaboration with biologists in the context of
              tracking and analyzing the behavior of captive live ant colonies. This research
              will yield novel, probabilistic algorithms for sensor-based identification,
              tracking, and modeling of the behavior of social multiagent systems.  A tight
              coupling between tracking and modeling is critical, especially when the
              observed system is composed of many agents.  The focus is on using models of
              behavior to improve the accuracy of sensor-based tracking, and on using
              improved tracking to learn better models.
