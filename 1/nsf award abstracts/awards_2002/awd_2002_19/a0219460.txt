Abstract    :
              Generation and manipulation of quantum entanglement of light fields are key
              techniques in the development of practical schemes for quantum information
              processing (QIP). In this project, the investigators will explore the
              all-optical route towards generation and control of the wave-packet mode
              properties of single photons, photon pairs, and multi-photon entangled states.
              To achieve this they will use the rapidly-advancing techniques of optical
              frequency conversion in second-order nonlinear optical crystals having
              controlled periodic structure for the purpose of phase matching. Such nonlinear
              photonic crystals can have tailor-made properties, giving the flexibility to
              design the wave-packet mode properties needed. And index wave-guiding
              structures can be introduced to control the transverse properties of the
              spatial modes. Furthermore, recently the method of one-dimensional quasi-phase
              matching has been generalized to the case of two-dimensional nonlinear photonic
              crystals. The combination of custom-designed periodicity (1- or 2-D) and
              waveguiding has the potential to lead to an unprecedented level of optical
              quantum-state control.
