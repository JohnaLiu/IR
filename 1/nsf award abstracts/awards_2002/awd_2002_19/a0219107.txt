Abstract    :
              This study will investigate online investing and virtual investing-related
              communities (VICs)looking at two broad research issues: (a) How is information
              generated, discussed, and diffused within and across VICs, and how do such
              activities impact market efficiency? and (b) How do economic, social and
              psychological influences together impact investor adoption, participation, and
              satisfaction? The study will involve processing over three million messages
              covering 40 stocks from 10 major VICs. The information will be parsed and
              categorized, and various hypotheses related to diffusion and market impacts
              will be tested. In-depth interviews and a large-scale survey of online
              investors will validate a comprehensive model of investor satisfaction. This
              research contributes to the information processing and diffusion, rumor
              propagation, impact of IT on markets, and individual/group behavior literatures
              that lie at the intersection of information systems, psychology, marketing, and
              economics. The research results will lay the foundation for the design of
              software tools that can detect worrisome types of information flow in
              real-time. From a regulatory perspective, an understanding of social and
              psychological biases and distorting influences will support the design of
              regulatory measures that counter their negative impacts.
