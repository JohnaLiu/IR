This three-year award for US-France collaboration in
              chemistry involves researchers and students at the University of Notre Dame and
              the University of Rennes.  Thomas P. Fehlner in the US and Jean-Francois Halet
              in France lead this collaboration.  They will investigate the electronic
              structure and reaction chemistry of a class of metallaborane clusters.  The
              former will address advanced qualitative molecular orbital theory and electron
              counting and the latter addresses metal properties responsible for exhibited
              structural behavior.  In these investigations, the researchers focus on
              explanations of chemical bonding of hypoelectronic metallaboranes.  They posit
              that the high thermal stability, low reactivity with air and water suggest new
              chemical species that lie somewhere between metallaboranes of later transition
              metals and solid state metal borides.  

The French team brings to the
              collaboration theoretical expertise and will perform large cluster,
              cross-cluster bonding and other calculations.  This is complemented by US
              experimental expertise in electrochemistry, design and synthesis.  The
              collaboration will advance understanding of the bonding and structural aspects
              of metallaboranes and approaches for new materials.

This award represents
              the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the CNRS.  NSF will cover
              travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and his students. The
              CNRS will support visits by French researchers and students to the United
              States.
