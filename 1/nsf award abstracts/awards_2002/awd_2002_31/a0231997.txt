Abstract    :
              



This GK-12 project supports fellows at the University of Oregon, from
              the departments of Physics and Chemistry, for educational activities with grade
              K-12 students in the rural Lane County school districts.  Eleven graduate
              students and two advanced undergraduates are supported per year.  The themes
              are hands-on experience, inquiry-based learning, and, for K-8, the creative use
              of "Science and Technology for Children" science kits.  The intellectual merit
              of this project includes the opportunity for the Fellows to work with teachers
              who help them develop effective teaching skills while honing their own
              understanding of mathematics and the sciences.   The broader impact is the help
              given to the schools as they adapt the kits for uses consistent with the state
              science standards. This project is receiving partial support from the
              Directorate for Mathematics and the Physical Sciences
