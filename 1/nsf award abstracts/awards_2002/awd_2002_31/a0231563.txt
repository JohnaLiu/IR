Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will perform
              research aimed at
characterizing subsurface residual stresses induced through
              surface treatments in single
crystal and complex polycrystalline materials.
              Photon Induced Positron Annihilation
(PIPA) will be used to quantify
              subsurface residual stress in single crystal materials and operational
              components subjected to high stress/high temperature environments. PIPA as a
              nondestructive material characterization technology has the potential to
              provide quantifiable, empirical data on atomic level, lattice structure changes
              in advanced metallic/intermetallic alloys used for critical component
              applications that result in failure. 

Commercially, government and industry
              spend billions of dollars each year in the maintenance and repair of components
              and systems. Many of the maintenance procedures are based upon conservative
              engineering models instead of actual empirical data, leading to early
              replacement of components, accelerated maintenance cycles, and a reactive
              versus proactive approach to failure mechanisms. PIPA provides real-time,
              empirical information on material characterization, redefining conservative
              prediction models and supplying decision makers with the hard data to evaluate
              materials and components for extension or replacement considerations, based
              upon the actual assessment of material damage.
