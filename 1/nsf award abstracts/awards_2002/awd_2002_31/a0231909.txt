Project STAMP - Science Technology and Mathematics Partnerships -
              provides graduate fellows from the University of Boston, from the departments
              of Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Medicine and Engineering, for educational
              activities with grade 6-12 students in the urban and suburban Boston, Chelsea,
              Newton and Quincy school districts. External partners include the Boston Museum
              of Science, the New England Aquarium, Melles Griot (an optics company) and the
              New England Board of Higher Education.  Nine graduate students and four
              advanced undergraduates are supported per year.  The themes are investigation,
              experimentation and problem solving.  Innovative aspects include the use of a
              mobile laboratory as a capstone experience.  The wide variety of school
              districts participating illustrate the broader impacts of this project as does
              the extensive use of the many resources available in the Boston area.  This
              project is partially supported with funds from the Directorate for Mathematics
              and the Physical Sciences
