Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
              reduction of NOx emissions from coal-fired power plants. The concept uses
              existing burner technology plus nitrogen enriched air (NEA) based on membrane
              technology to reduce NOx emissions. Modeling work projects 300-fold NOx
              emissions reductive using this approach. Preliminary estimates suggest that
              this approach will be less expensive than existing selective catalytic
              reduction (SCR) systems. The program focuses on coal fired electrical power
              facilities since they are most demanding due to high flame temperature and high
              contamination level. Phase I will demonstrate process feasibility on small
              furnace system and will identify leading low cost NEA candidate (membrane or
              pipeline nitrogen).  The results will be compared to existing SCR NOx cleanup
              technologies.

If successful this technology offers major cost effective
              routes to reduction of NOx in coal-fired power plants and other facilities.
