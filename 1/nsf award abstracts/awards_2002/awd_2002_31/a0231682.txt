Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project  proposes a
              unique rolled-ribbon cell  for a 
Lithium-ion battery that has inherent cost
              advantages for a NGV FreedomCar compact 
pulse-power application.  It can meet
              the cost requirements and deliver thousands of 
pulses and recharges.  The
              battery is formed by stacking large capacity (5-10Ah), sealed, 
125mm
              diameter, button cells to optimize power capability.  The battery design
              projects 
power at 2-4kW/kg and power density at 7.5kW/liter similar to a
              ultracapacitor, with 20 
times greater specific energy at 70-90Wh/kg .  Of
              particular importance to high-power 
battery, the rolled-ribbon design
              overcomes safety concerns by its unique internal heat 
dissipation.  
              Perpendicularly oriented electrode foils remove heat from the electrode
              
interface to the disc-cell hardware without crossing Celgard separator. The
              high temperature stability of Lithium ion will be enhanced with a flame
              retardant electrolyte 
additive. 

The NGV FreedomCar can anticipate a
              viable safe, high power Li-ion battery using the 
rolled-ribbon cell design,
              that is more compact and cost-effective than ultracapacitors or 
other
              high-power batteries.  Improved performance and temperature stability for
              Li-ion 
battery can enhance prospects for the civilian hybrid vehicle market. 
              Gasoline savings 
will reduce air pollution and oil imports.
