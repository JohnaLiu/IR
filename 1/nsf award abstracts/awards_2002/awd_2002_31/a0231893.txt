Abstract    :
              
This study proposes to conduct rigorous research on the strategic use of
              classroom talk  for teaching mathematics to middle grade non-English speaking
              students.  They will seek to learn whether discourse-intensive mathematics
              instruction between teachers and students, and between students and students,
              is effective in a three-year micro-analytic study of student learning in four
              discourse-intensive versions of connected Mathematics.  Paper and pencil tests
              of the concepts in the lessons will be collected, students will be videotaped
              in clinical interviews, and a detailed analysis of the videotapes will be
              conducted.  The same teachers will deliver the teaching modules in two
              different formats to matched classes of 7th grade students.  The student
              population will be mostly non-English speaking students of low-income
              backgrounds.  Teachers will receive training in the methods.  

The panel
              considered this proposal to be an outstanding proposal because it was based on
              a previous study by the author of the proposal, cites other relevant research,
              and has a strong group of advisors.
