Abstract    :
              Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) is partnering with the Worcester Public
              School System on a project focusing on the development of human resources
              related to grade K-6 STEM education.    Projects goals include: developing
              partnerships among graduate and undergraduate fellows, public school teachers
              and students, and WPI and WPI-affiliated faculty; implementing the
              Massachusetts Science and Technology/Engineering Curriculum Framework (MSTECF)
              in the K-6 curriculum by using the partnerships to develop specific teaching
              strategies; and assessing and disseminating the outreach process, student
              learning outcomes and teacher preparation that result from this project.  The
              intellectual merit of this project is evidenced by the support given to the
              innovative technology component of the state standards.  The direct interaction
              with K-6 schools, teachers and students is part of the broader impacts of this
              project.   This project is partially supported by funds from the Directorate
              for Engineering.
