Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59)

This is a project to organize a conference on
              "Colleges of Education and Engineering: Fostering Campus Collaborations". This
              is a follow-up conference which builds upon the success of the previous
              conference "Taking the Lead: A Deans Summit on Education for Technological
              World". 

This conference comprises of approximately 200-250 attendees,
              including faculty from both engineering and education colleges as well as
              deans, provosts or presidents. The conference features best practices in campus
              collaborations that result in enhanced teacher preparation, improved curricula
              and teaching methodologies, expanded outreach for both education and
              engineering programs, and educational standards development. All sessions cover
              methodologies and strategies to overcome constraints and to maximize impact.
              The conference focuses on teacher preparation, community outreach to K-12, and
              pedagogical strategies for engineering education. In addition, seven themes are
              emphasized throughout the conference. These themes consist of "Community of
              Deans", "Collaborations", "Diversity", "Successful practices
              Integrating/Infusing Standards", "Pipeline for Teacher Education and
              Engineering", and "Funding Sources".
