The Alaska Native Science Commission was created to
              bring together research and science in partnership with Native communities. The
              Commission provides information, referral, and networking services for
              researchers seeking active partners among Alaska Native communities. This
              cooperative agreement will provide a continuation of services to Native
              communities, scientists, and researchers. The Commission's concerns include
              Arctic climate systems and ecosystems, environmental change, links between
              environmental change and human activity, and the inclusion of Native people in
              the planning, implementation, and interpretation of scientific research.
