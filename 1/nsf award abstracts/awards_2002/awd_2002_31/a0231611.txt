Abstract    :
              At the request of the hosting school district, teams that include a practicing
              teacher, a college faculty member, a graduate student and an advanced
              undergraduate student are developing problem centered, interdisciplinary
              learning environments that focus on the application of mathematics to earth
              science and engineering for middle school students. Through workshops and
              classroom experiences, this project is improving the instruction of middle
              school and high school students and the preparation of future teachers and
              faculty.  The broader impacts of these activities include enriching: the
              teacher preparation experiences of undergraduate and graduate students who are
              interested in pursuing pre-college or college education as a potential career;
              the content, application and interdisciplinary knowledge of practicing science
              and mathematics teachers with respect to the application of mathematics to
              earth science and engineering; the learning experience of middle school
              students by creating problem centered, interdisciplinary learning environments
              that focus on the application of mathematics to earth science and engineering. 
              Part of the support for this project comes from the Directorate for Mathematics
              and Physical Sciences.
