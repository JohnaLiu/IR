Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate
              the feasibility of producing thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), along with
              sealcoats engineered to minimize oxygen ingress through the TBC to the
              bondcoat, by a novel chemical vapor deposition (CVD) route. Success will
              largely be determined through evaluation of test coupons in actual use
              conditions.  The key innovation of the project is the development of a
              technique for the application of yttria- and ceria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ and
              CSZ respectively) using inexpensive metal halide precursors. 
     Improved
              TBCs will have wide application to commercial and military propulsion and power
              generation systems, including turbine and reciprocating
