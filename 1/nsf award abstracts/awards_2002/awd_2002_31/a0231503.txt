Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              key technology designed to enhance the definition and characterization of oil
              reservoirs, by using state-of-the-art 3-D prestack depth imaging technology
              coupled with advanced rock physics principles to produce high-resolution
              petrophysical and structural information.  Briefly stated, this technology will
              allow oil and gas companies to extract rock information from seismic data. 
              Extensions to this technology are not limited to only 3-D or 4-D (time lapse)
              imaging, but can also be applied to medical imaging, EPA projects of
              identifying buried hazardous substances, remote imaging using ground
              penetrating radar, etc.  The complete software package will be a
              state-of-the-art program offering features and utilities that are presently
              unavailable in the exploration industry. 

The commercial potential of the
              technology proposed is considerable because it allows 3-D and 4-D seismic data
              to be much more effectively used to characterize and delineate oil reservoirs
              and to monitor enhanced oil recovery processes.  This area of seismic imaging
              and reservoir characterization is greatly influenced by technology developments
              and represents a fast commercial growth sector.  This advanced technology
              directly impacts the discovery and recovery of hydrocarbons and could decrease
              dependence on imported oil.  In existing oil fields, better seismic images of
              complicated subsurface geology directly coupled with petrophysical information,
              can reduce development costs and increase the amount of hydrocarbons recovered.
