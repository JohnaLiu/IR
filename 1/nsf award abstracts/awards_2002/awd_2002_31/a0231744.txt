Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project, will develop a liquid
              lens for nanomachining materials with pulsed laser beams.  The project team
              will design and fabricate a liquid lens capable of producing laser beam spot
              sizes on the order of nanometers (20-100 nm) through its nonlinear effects,
              including self-focusing, self-trapping, and harmonic generation obtained
              through intense laser beam propagation in liquid. The end product will be a
              fiber optic cable  assembly  in  which  the  nonlinear  optical  liquid  will 
              be  filled  in  hollow glass waveguides with a core diameter of one millimeter
              and the end faces will be fastened with two standard SMA 905 connectors.  Upon
              interfacing  with a high  energy, Q-switched Nd: YAG laser, this unique liquid 
              lens  will  facilitate  obtaining  various  nanometer  spot  sizes  and 
              wavelengths  by  simply changing  the  liquid  medium. The project team will
              demonstrate  the  feasibility  of  a liquid  lens  for nanomachining of medical
              devices such as catheters in a vibration-isolation work environment.
              

Commercially, the proposed liquid lens and nanomachining are intended to
              fill the miniaturization needs of high-technology industries. Possible
              commercial applications include medical devices (pacemakers,
              implants,stents,catheters), electronic and photonic devices, magnetic disks,
              instrumentation, telecommunication devices, and microelectromechanical systems
              (MEMS). The liquid lens will offer new capabilities for modern laser systems,
              flexible processing with single wavelength laser, and ultra-precision
              machining.
