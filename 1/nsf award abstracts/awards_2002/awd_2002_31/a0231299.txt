Abstract    :
              The objective of the project is to design and fabricate a low-speed internal
              combustion engine and associated measurement systems for real time
              visualization of thermodynamic processes. The prototype engine addresses a
              significant need in teaching fundamental thermodynamic processes. It provides
              means to demonstrate typically non-intuitive or abstract processes, i.e. the
              processes associated with an internal combustion engine. The system is designed
              to provide maximum control of input variables with both display and
              computerized acquisition of all parameters. This standalone tabletop system
              provides real-time class demonstrations to courses such as thermodynamics, and
              captures the primary input/output information that characterizes the system.
              The physical demonstration system is used by instructors in high school,
              technical or university settings.
