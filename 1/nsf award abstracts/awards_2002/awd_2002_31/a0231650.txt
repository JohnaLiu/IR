Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to devise
              software to provide quick (24- hour) and affordable analyses for competitive
              technological intelligence and innovation forecasting.  It substantially
              enriches intelligence on external technology progress for decision-making. 
              Search Technology proposes to work closely with our partner to develop "Quick
              Technology Information Products" (QTIPs) to address the needs of a spectrum of
              senior technology managers and professionals.  Macros will be prepared to
              expedite information search in extensive R&D publication and patent databases,
              text analyses, and graphical representation of findings for intranet
              dissemination.  Findings will address "who's doing what?" on technologies of
              interest, and go further to identify research and development patterns, map
              topical interrelationships, and forecast likely developmental progression using
              a series of innovation indicators.  The project entails requirements analysis,
              evaluation of pilot analyses, and coding of macros to facilitate the priority
              information products.

Potential commercial applications include enhanced
              analytical software for industry and fast-response information services on
              emerging technologies.  Both aim to enhance technology management by improving
              R&D portfolio selection, intellectual property exploitation, new product
              development, and external collaboration in technology development.
