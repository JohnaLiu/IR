Abstract    :
              This project provides the tools and assistance that faculty need to create the
              next generation robotics laboratory at their own institutions: (1) a
              well-supported research-level hardware platform; (2) an open source software
              system that abstracts from the details of any particular robot and allows users
              to explore complex control methods at a high level; and (3) a project-based
              curriculum integrated with the hardware and software.  The PIs serve as mentors
              through on-site visits, close e-mail contact, and yearly workshops.
