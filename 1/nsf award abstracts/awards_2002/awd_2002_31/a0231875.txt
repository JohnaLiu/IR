Abstract    :
              


This GK-12 project supports fellows at Columbia University, from the
              departments of Biology, Chemistry, and Mathematics, and undergraduate fellows
              at Barnard College, from the Department of Environmental Science.  The fellows
              engage in educational activities with middle school students in an urban New
              York City school district. Nine graduate students and three advanced
              undergraduates are supported per year.  Teams of fellows and science teachers
              utilize inquiry-based projects in an effort to develop novel curricula based on
              issues that connect with the everyday lives of the students.  The science is
              presented with other areas of instruction such as social studies, art and
              literature to enhance the students' appreciation for the social context of
              science.  The Institute for Learning Technologies at Teachers College of
              Columbia University is a partner in this project.  The intellectual merit is
              evidenced by the unique inclusion of literature and history in the presentation
              of science in the middle school context, e.g. including reading and writing
              skills.  Broader impacts relate to the relevance of the subjects targeted, e.g.
              environmental issues.  This project is partially supported by funds from the
              Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
