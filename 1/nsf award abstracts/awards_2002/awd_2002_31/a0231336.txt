Abstract    :
              This project is creating a web-based mathematical modeling forum to support the
              teaching and learning of mathematical modeling on a national scale. The forum
              provides a rich environment in which students and faculty can explore
              applications problems in depth, learning mathematics in the context of its
              contemporary use. Students are offered a wide variety of modeling problems
              coded by level of difficulty and application area. In addition, students may
              post full or partial solutions, pose questions, and participate in extended
              discussions. Experienced faculty and practitioners from across the country
              contribute problems, serve as reviewers of posted solutions, and facilitate and
              moderate the online discussions.
