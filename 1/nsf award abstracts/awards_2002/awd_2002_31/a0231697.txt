Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and
              demonstrate a novel three dimensional (3D) ear camera technology that enables
              audiologists to acquire multiple 3D images of external ear (auricle) and ear
              canal, and to produce complete 3D digital ear model that serves as a "digital
              ear impression". The digital ear impression data will be sent instantly to
              manufacture's lab via the Internet, dramatically reducing the delivery time.
              The digital impressions enable the hearing aid manufacturers to take advantages
              of the latest breakthrough of CAD/CAM and rapid prototyping technologies.  This
              technology will permit mass product customization of hearing aid devices within
              a one-day time frame. 

The commercial potential would be a process that
              would drastically reduce the time for custom-fit hearing-aid devices. Even
              including the quality insurance, electronics calibration, and shipping, the
              entire process would be shorted from weeks to a few days. More importantly, the
              digital impression technology will improve the quality of fit, thus enhance the
              hearing functionality for impaired people.
