Abstract    :
              This project is attempting to address the need for materials that help students
              master a large body of factual material in anatomy and physiology in a manner
              that emphasizes the development of problem-solving and other core scientific
              competencies.  The project aims to develop a prototype set of materials
              covering the heart and cardiovascular system that incorporates hands-on
              experiences and student-centered problem-solving tasks.  The project seeks to
              serve as a model for how to develop new curricula and low cost materials, and
              how to train instructor in their use.  A laboratory guide, instructor's manual
              and CD showing how the model is used, are being written.  The products will be
              evaluated both with respect to their efficacy in training instructors and their
              impact on student learning.
