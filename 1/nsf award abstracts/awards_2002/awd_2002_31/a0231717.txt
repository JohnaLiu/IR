Abstract    :
                  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes a Quantum
              Intelligence System (QIS), a cross-industry Business Activity Monitoring (BAM)
              platform that integrates business intelligence and optimization for real-time
              performance monitoring, automation, and optimization of complex business
              processes.  The objectives are to demonstrate how to look through real-time
              data, report performance indicators, detect and diagnose problems, and
              visualize results. Its key innovation is to integrate a large amount of quantum
              information, automatically perform many what-if analyses and optimize a
              sequence of responses. The anticipated results include a preliminary prototype
              demonstrating the business values. 
    QIS can be applied to supply chain
              management such as inventory management, production planning and logistics,
              resource/budget allocation, quality monitoring, and control and maintenance for
              reliability. QIS can also be applied to industries in the area of revenue,
              resource, and business activity monitoring.  QIS is a cross-industry platform
              to provide real-time performance monitoring, problem detection and diagnosis,
              and improvement of overall business efficiency and performance.
