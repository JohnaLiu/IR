Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project addresses the
              development of a proton- exchange membrane for use in elevated temperature
              proton-exchange membrane fuel cells  (ETPEMFC) (>100C) for automotive
              applications. In this work we propose to develop a membrane that can operate at
              temperatures  approaching 150C. Specific program objectives include: (1) to
              demonstrate feasibility of  fabricating a membrane for ETPEMFC use, (2) to
              evaluate select, important physical/chemical  properties of the membrane, (3)
              to fabricate high performance Membrane-Electrode Assemblies  (MEAs) for ETPEMFC
              use, and (4) to demonstrate performance of the MEA in single-cell  ETPEMFC at
              temperatures up to 150C. The proposed research will consist of membrane 
              synthesis, evaluation and fuel cell testing. 

The potential market for
              PEMFC, for transportation vehicles and utility applications (residential, 
              power) is in the 100s of billions of dollars. The California (CA) legislature
              previously mandated  that by 2004, 10% of large volume manufacturer's sales in
              CA must be Zero-Emission Vehicles  (ZEVs).  Many other states, including 
              Massachusetts, followed the lead taken by CA. The market value of residential
              fuel  cells, by the year 2020, is expected to reach $40 billion according to
              estimates by the Small Scale  Fuel Cell Commercialization Group, Oklahoma City.
              Retail prices for the residential systems  (approx 7 kW) are expected to be
              $4,000 by the year 2003.
