Abstract    :
              This project is building upon a proof-of-concept grant to create a comprehensive
              library of course activities for environmental science courses.  In the
              proof-of-concept phase, four multi-week, Internet-based laboratory modules were
              developed on topics in environmental science for Kennesaw State University's
              (KSU) general education course in Interdisciplinary Science. The laboratory
              program utilizes a combination of field studies, wet labs, and Internet-based
              experiences to allow students to examine local environmental issues and their
              individual contribution to regional and global environmental impacts. The
              exercises were tested at KSU in Fall 2001 and Spring 2002 with approximately
              1,500 students, and our experiences, assessment data, and outside evaluation
              indicate significant benefits to our approach and strongly suggest continued
              development.  In this full development phase, we are expanding upon and
              improving our existing collection of laboratory modules to encompass all of the
              major topics covered in environmental science courses. The 10 modules being
              developed are textbook-independent, and available to any interested party
              through the Internet. The modules are being created by an interdisciplinary
              team of scientists from four diverse institutions, and tested in the various
              class formats for environmental science courses (no lab, "open" lab, and
              conventional lab). In addition to the laboratory modules, the development team
              is creating an extensive collection of instructor resources, tailored to each
              course format.
