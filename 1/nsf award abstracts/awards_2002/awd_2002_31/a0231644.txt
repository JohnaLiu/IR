Abstract    :
              The proposed project is designed to develop and test a model to build evaluation
              capacity in agencies, organizations and programs focused on increasing the
              diversity of the STEM workforce. Specifically project goals are to improve the
              funding agency's ability to assess the effectiveness of their efforts, to
              identify effective innovations, to develop a replicable model to facilitate
              capacity building and to disseminate the model widely.  Objectives are focused
              on strengthening/improving the data collection process and testing the
              resulting model in several agencies (NSF, NIH, GE Foundation) that fund efforts
              to increase the diversity of the STEM workforce. Activities include document
              review, the development of an evaluation template and preparation of technical
              manuals to guide agency efforts.
