Abstract    :
              This evaluative research project seeks to evaluate the capacity of research
              units in academic settings.  Capacity is determined by by the fit of the human
              capital available in the research unit and the infrastructure available to
              support them.  Emphasis will be placed on information technology where much
              current interest exists. The researchers will look at three setting: research
              centers in majority institutions, science and engineering in HBCUs and EPSCoR
              institutions, and traditional disciplinary-based departments.  The study will
              be carried out with a variety of methodologies, including case studies,
              questionnaires and review of existing materials.
