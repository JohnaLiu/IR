Abstract    :
              



This project is a partnership of several science departments and several
              minority serving school systems.  The Broader Impact of the project is very
              high.  Students are placed in several urban schools with large minority
              enrollments.  The Fellows, in partnership with cooperating teachers, are
              adapting and implementing laboratories, activities and demonstrations that meet
              California science content standards. Part of the Intellectual Merit of the
              proposal is the broad range of academic faculty involved in both supervising
              Fellows and participating in professional development activities.  The
              Departments of Physics and Astronomy, Geological Sciences, Chemistry and
              Biochemistry, Biology and Microbiology are involved.  This project is receiving
              partial support from the Directorate for Mathematics and the Physical
              Sciences.
