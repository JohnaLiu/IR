Abstract    :
              
Graduate and Undergraduate Fellows are working  directly with Teachers drawn
              from 13 participating Environmental Science and Forestry  in the High School
              schools to  cooperatively lead course-specific, co-curricular and inter-school
              environmental science  classroom, laboratory, and field experiences. In
              addition they are helping organize a district-wide 7th/8th grade science fair
              (The  Environmental Challenge) and a 13-high school student science research
              symposium  (The Environmental Summit) as two specific synthesizing events. 
              Formative evaluation  information is being collected and used to monitor, take
              corrective actions as necessary, and ensure the project  achieves four
              outcomes:  improved Fellow communication and teaching-related skills; teacher
              content gain and professional development; enriched student science learning; 
              and strengthened school/college partnerships  The project uses specific
              instructional and professional development activities to present environmental
              science themes such as sustainability, human population  growth, a global
              perspective, the urban environment, and ethics.  As examples: the  Onondaga
              Lake Ecosystem Study provides a setting for study of a severely polluted  urban
              lake and its restoration/recovery plan;  the Onondaga City Park landscape
              frames  vital issues of urban ecosystem biodiversity, land use and
              sustainability; and the Adirondack  Highlands Regional Ecosystem Study offers
              opportunities for learning about the globally  significant phenomenon of
              ecological impacts of chronic atmospheric deposition on  aquatic and
              terrestrial communities and projected recovery as Clean Air Act emissions 
              reductions are implemented.  The broader impacts of the project include the
              widely diverse audience in the schools served; the Syracuse City School
              District with  25,000 students is one of New York State's "Big Five" urban
              school districts, while the additional partnering school districts represent a
              rich mix of suburban and rural  characteristics.  This project is partially
              supported from funds from the Directorate for Biological Siences.
