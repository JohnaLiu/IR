Abstract    :
              This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to explore the effects of
              team-based effects on learning engineering at the undergraduate level.  The
              work will be undertaken in two main phases.  The first phase includes the
              development, validation, and testing of a new student assessment protocol for
              team-based learning in engineering.  The second phase includes the development
              and use of an observation protocol in assessing team behaviors, which will be
              used in refining the model of team design offered in the proposal.  Several
              propositions have been put forth as to what factors affect the outcomes of
              group learning experiences. The work will take place at the University of
              Nebraska-Lincoln, Pennsylvania State University, and with students
              participating in electronic teams as part of the National Collegiate Inventors
              and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA).  The team represents expertise in engineering
              and educational psychology.
