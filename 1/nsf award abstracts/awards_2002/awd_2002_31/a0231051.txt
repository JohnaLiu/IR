Abstract    :
              The objective of our project is to replace the existing two sequence
              undergraduate design courses with pedagogy that teaches Combined Steady state
              and Dynamic (CSAD) concepts in all aspects of the design process. Our
              proof-of-concept is aimed at investigating how this new pedagogy can be
              implemented. The mainstay of our work is the application/implementation of
              results, developed by the PIs and others, in the area of plantwide process
              control. The present pedagogy of chemical process design covers only
              steady-state design concepts but tends to ignore operational and control
              considerations. These remain the domain of a control/instrument engineer.
              Unfortunately, operating requirements during startup and shutdown usually are
              much different than those at steady state, and a process designed solely for a
              given steady-state condition may not be operational or controllable. Today's
              chemical industry needs more efficient design and they seek chemical engineers
              capable of doing the tasks of design and control simultaneously. Our work is an
              attempt to address this issue.
