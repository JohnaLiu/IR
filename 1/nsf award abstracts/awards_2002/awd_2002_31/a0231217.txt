Abstract    :
              During the past three years a 3D, interactive, web-based computer graphics
              system called The Optics Project on the Web (WebTOP) was developed that helps
              students in introductory physics classes and upper-level optics classes learn
              optics. WebTOP contains sixteen different modules, and has a scripting feature
              that allows the user to record an interactive session and play it back later. 
              This system was developed under an NSF CCLI proof of concept grant.  Faculty
              members and students at seven different universities have used it for in-class
              demonstrations and for homework assignments. Student evaluations of WebTOP have
              shown that it helps students visualize and understand optical phenomena. 
              

The current project fully develops WebTOP and disseminates it nationally.
              The objectives are as follows. (1) To use a team of seven optics and physics
              education experts from universities across the nation to develop a set of
              web-based tutorials that use WebTOP modules and directed discovery questions
              (with detailed solutions) to teach the basic principles of optics. (2) To give
              the entire physics and engineering community nationally an opportunity to adapt
              WebTOP to their own needs by developing a script editing tool for WebTOP
              scripts and by making WebTOP open source. (3) To create three new modules for
              WebTOP.  

This project provides a system with nineteen modules and thirteen
              tutorials and builds a nationwide set of university users.
