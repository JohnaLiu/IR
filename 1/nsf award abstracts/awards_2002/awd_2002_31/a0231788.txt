Abstract    :
              This project would develop a twenty-credit certificate program in evaluation
              that students could complete in 9 months to1 year.  In addition to regular
              course work in evaluation, this certificate program would include a practicum
              to give students the opportunity to work directly on evaluation projects. 
              Students would be recruited from the surrounding area, which has  large
              minority populations.  It is expected that many students would be employees of
              State and Federal government agencies in the region and letters of support from
              many of these agencies were included.  There are no other certificate programs
              in evaluation known to exist at this time.
