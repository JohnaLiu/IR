Abstract    :
              The primary focus of the project will be to develop learning teams comprised of
              middle school students, teachers, graduate student fellows and Ball State
              University faculty.  The partnership works together on inquiry-based
              environmental studies at the local, regional and global levels. The common
              experience for all participants is The Global Learning and Observations to
              Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Program.  GLOBE integrates science, mathematics
              and technology into its educational format.  The learning teams devise a system
              wide student inquiry project to investigate an environmental issue of local
              significance.  Schools collect local environmental data using established
              scientific protocols and, through the technology of the GLOBE web site,
              communicate with students from other regions and countries. These activities
              are integrated with and support the Indianapolis Public School's science
              curriculum frameworks.  The core experiences emphasized by the project include:
               (1) content in life, physical and earth/space science, (2) the inquiry
              process, (3) data gathering and analysis, and  (4) graphing and interpretation
              of scientific data.  PIE teaches students to trust the observations they make
              and conclusions they draw.  The broader impact of the project include its focus
              on bringing environmental educational experiences to an urban student
              population and the opportunity it provides for middle school students to become
              scientists in their own backyard. This project is partially supported with
              funds from the Directorate for Biological Sciences.
