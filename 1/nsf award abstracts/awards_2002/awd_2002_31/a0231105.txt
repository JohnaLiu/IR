Abstract    :
              Research in the life sciences is becoming more and more interdisciplinary,
              relying on knowledge from physics, chemistry, and mathematics.  However, as
              undergraduates, most future scientists study these disciplines in a series of
              unrelated courses that do not help them learn how to apply the tools and key
              concepts from one discipline to another. This proof-of-concept project is 
              creating and testing learning materials, specifically a set of life science
              cases, that require students to use information from their math and chemistry
              courses to address tough biological problems. This teaching/learning approach
              aims to foster the development of critical thinking, teamwork and communication
              skills. The cases are being implemented and assessed in the context of Biology
              Interest Groups (BIGs), a UW-Madison program in which first year
students
              co-enroll in calculus, chemistry, and a special topics biology seminar. A
              faculty team with representatives from biology, chemistry and mathematics is
              developing cases on Infectious Disease, Ecology, Food Production and Exercise
              Physiology.  Topics emphasize real world problems and are drawn from the
              research disciplines of the case developers.  Overall project evaluation is
              assessing student attitudes and learning, and determine the success of the team
              process for development.  Project outcomes will be shared with science/math
              faculty at the UW-Madison and other UW-System campuses statewide.
