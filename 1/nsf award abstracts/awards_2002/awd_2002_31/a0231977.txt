Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on the
              development of economical processes to produce a highly selective, long life,
              low-cost hydrogen separation membrane for the purification of a fuel stream
              from a steam reforming fuel processor.  Recently developed processes for rapid
              direct-write  deposition processes will be applied to produce thin (<10microns)
              palladium alloy membranes as a primary cost reduction step. Preliminary trials
              with these novel processes on porous metal show encouraging results in terms of
              deposition of a uniform membrane, homogeneous alloy compositions and stability
              to thermal cycling. 

Producing pure hydrogen from hydrocarbon based fuels
              on-site  and on-demand is critical to enabling the burgeoning fuel cell
              industry.  At present, distribution costs for hydrogen can represent more than
              99 percent of the total cost of hydrogen.  To meet and/or surpass cost
              projections for 2005 and beyond in the stationary, portable and automotive fuel
              cell markets, it will require innovative concepts for reducing both high volume
              manufacturing and material costs. Estimates project that costs for fuel
              processing systems must be reduced 3x - 6x by the year 2005 to meet cost
              targets of $1,500 per kilowatt and allow the fuel cell industry to become a
              viable energy alternative.
