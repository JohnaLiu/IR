Abstract    :
              
NCTM's standards impact research group proposes a research catalyst conference
              designed to make progress on understanding the improvement of mathematics
              teaching and learning.  They will attend to this by hosting a conference around
              key questions related to the impact, implementation and influence of standards
              in schools (and the related instruction, instructional materials, assessment,
              teacher education, and policy issues that follow).  The second intent of the
              conference is to build and strengthen the possibility for interdisciplinary
              research in mathematics education.  Consequently, invitees to the conference
              will represent many and varied disciplines (including but not limited to:
              mathematics, mathematics education, sociology, measurement, and policy).
