Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a
              transparent AlON with superior mechanical and optical properties using a novel
              powder synthesis method.  This innovative powder synthesis method can not only
              reduce the particle size but also enhance the uniformity of the reactants. 
              Increasing the sinterability and reducing the diffusion path can reduce the
              sintering time and sintering temperature reduced significantly.  The advantage
              of these sintering conditions is a lower processing cost and a microstructure
              with much smaller grain size compared with the conventional processed AlON.   
              Mechanical and thermal shock capabilities of transparent polycrystalline
              ceramics are limited by their mechanical strength, which in turn is enhanced
              when the grain size is decreased.  The optical properties can also be improved
              due to less milling process, which results much less impurities pick-up. This
              innovative synthesis method can convert the surface of the powder into oxide,
              which makes it possible to process the powder in aqueous solution.  The
              processing cost can be reduced significantly by using the aqueous solution.  

                  The transparent AlON developed in this program can be used to replace
              translucent Al2O3 for the sodium and halogen lamp applications.  It can also be
              used for IR missile domes, transparent armors, supermarket scanners, glass for
              Xerox copy machine and scanners, and optical lenses. This new material could
              revolutionize the optical industry by replacing glass and sapphire.
