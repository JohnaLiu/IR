Abstract    :
              Project Summary 

Eight districts in central Maine that comprise the Penobscot
              River Educational Partnership (PREP); four of them, including Maine Indian
              Education, partners in a current GK-12 project, have joined with the University
              of Maine to form Fellow-teacher teams to introduce K-12 students to
              experiments, field trips, and discussions in areas such as chemistry, climate
              change, marine sciences, molecular biology, geology, food sciences, and
              ecology.  The program is: a) helping   teachers and students reach the State of
              Maine's legislatively-mandated standards for Science & Technology (the Maine
              Learning Results), b) strengthening Fellows' communication and teaching skills,
              c) providing professional development for Teachers, d) enriching science for
              K-12 students, e) providing young male and female role models of SMET
              professionals to children in grades 3-11, and f) strengthening contacts between
              GK-12 science faculty and K-12 districts.  The K-12 students are monitoring
              water chemistry and species diversity and abundance in cooperating federal
              wildlife refuges in areas near them.  These shared monitoring activities link
              classes throughout the entire scope of the project. The spatially and
              temporally distributed data enables the teams to introduce interesting analyses
              and discussions across partner classes interacting through videoconferences.
              Each Fellow works intensively with two teachers in PREP and with a teacher from
              eastern Maine (Washington & Hancock Counties), western Maine (Madison), or
              southern Maine (Damariscotta, site of the University of Maine's marine sciences
              laboratory).  The power of Maine's network of ATM classrooms, is being used to
              expand the Fellows' role modeling and introduce Fellows to a variety of
              teaching styles. The broader impacts of the project include strengthened
              backgrounds in science and attendance at the Maine summer Science Camp for the
              cooperating teachers. The K-12 districts' benefits include the enriched
              learning of their students and access to the equipment from microscopes to
              thermal cyclers that is necessary to meet the goals of the Learning Results,
              but which many districts lack. The University of Maine is benefiting from K-12
              students who come to the University better prepared in science and is
              fulfilling its mission as a Land Grant/Sea Grant institution to serve both the
              state of Maine and the nation as a whole.
