Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop
              proof-of-principle software permitting any graphic to be converted easily into
              a universally usable file in the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) web language
              format.  Any sighted person with rudimentary computer skills could use this
              software to convert a graphic to SVG and could add information that does not
              change the visual appearance of the graphic, but makes it usable by individuals
              who are blind or have other print reading disabilities.  A blind computer user
              could then download the file from the web and view it by embossing a copy on
              the Tiger Tactile Graphics and Braille Embosser, placing the tactile copy on an
              inexpensive digitizing pad, and pressing objects in the graphic in order to
              hear them identified by the self-voicing Accessible SVG Viewer.
     ViewPlus
              Technologies expects Accessible SVG to be adopted rapidly by authors who need
              to display graphical information and who work in institutions required to
              provide accessible information.  As SVG becomes more and more popular, a
              substantial fraction of web authors and webmasters are likely to purchase the
              SVG conversion software.  Generally, most companies and institutions are
              discovering that it is good business to make their information accessible and
              are likely to do so if most authors can understand easily ho to accomplish that
              objective.
