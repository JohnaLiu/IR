Abstract    :
              Drawing on the experience of the Center for Learning Technologies in Urban
              Schools, especially through its work in Detroit's middle schools over the past
              five years, a cornerstone experiment is proposed.  A classroom-based study will
              examine the use of palm-sized computers, in comparison to pencil-and-paper, in
              supporting students carrying out two key science learning activities - concept
              mapping and explaining. While there are good reasons to believe that these
              learning activities, uniquely supported by the palm-sized computers, may well
              lead to student achievement gains and improved attitudes toward science, the
              data from this study will be most revealing.  The proposed experimental study,
              then, should help researchers and practitioners of the educational community
              develop a deeper understanding of the educational costs and benefits of the
              emerging handheld technologies.
