Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Colorado State University for Nancy Levinger with
              the Chemistry REU Leadership Group to host a Workshop for selected REU
              (Research Experience for Undergraduates) and LS-AMP (Louis Stokes Alliance for
              Minority Participation) Program Directors to explore ways for these two major
              NSF programs to operate synergistically to lead to mutually beneficial
              interactions for both programs.  Also funded will be travel grants for over 50
              students each year to participate in the spring ACS (American Chemical Society)
              Meetings in 2003 and 2004.  These travel awards will leverage additional funds
              and facilitate the attendance at both of these meetings for 100-150 students
              participants each year.  Inter-institutional interactions and possible
              collaboration between REU faculty and site directors will also be promoted. 
              Support is also provided for regular meetings of the Chemistry Leadership Group
              to meet to proceed with implementing the recommendations from the Spring 2001
              Workshop for the Chemistry REU Site Directors.  Items that these meetings will
              address also include program evaluation and development, and explore
              cooperative ventures between different programs.
