Abstract    :
              This project is developing and evaluating prototypes of interactive, dynamic,
              and visually oriented webpages linked by common themes. Current technologies
              facilitate animation and exploration of interconnected networks of information,
              and in this manner new concepts are made more accessible when associated with
              more elementary and familiar ones. Unifying mathematical principles can lead
              students to formulate their own mathematical questions, discover results, and
              organize and understand their knowledge. The presentations include motivation
              from modern applications as well as animations of classical examples.  Modules
              are expected to become part of the National Science Digital Library and
              available as an online resource for both teachers and students, to review
              fundamentals, to preview more advanced manifestations and applications, and to
              emphasize discovery using animated and linked explanations and "proofs without
              (and with!) words."
