Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate
              the feasibility of fabricating carbon nanofiber reinforced  carbon-carbon (C-C)
              composite by integrating catalytic nanofiber 
growth and carbon deposition
              into a single operation. The main advantage of this process 
is the ability to
              directly  fabricate components on substrates at a high rate thus it avoids
              
the conventionally used lengthy C-C fabrication approach with multiple steps.
               As a result, 
the  manufacturing  complexity,  the  process  cycle  time, 
              and  the  cost  will  be  greatly 
reduced.  In addition, since high density
              carbon and high strength carbon nanofibers are 
engineered in an integrated
              form, the C-C composite is expected to have unprecedented 
mechanical
              properties  compared with conventional C-C composite.  

Commercially this
              technology will increase the reliability and reduce manufacturing cost, thus
              making the 
American  C-C  composite  products  more  competitive  in  the 
              world  market.  One  immediate 
application of this composite will be for
              aircraft brake components. The technology can 
also be applied to many other
              applications such as computer hard disc media substrates 
and the next
              generation medical implants.
