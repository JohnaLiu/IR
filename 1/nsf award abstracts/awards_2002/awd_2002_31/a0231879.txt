Abstract    :
              Research in education and psychology has demonstrated that adults and children
              often understand shared experiences in very different ways, but much less is
              known about how teachers and their students understand shared lessons, or how
              classroom learning occurs as teachers' and students' understandings interact
              over sequences of lessons.  The research proposed here will focus on the
              interplay between teachers' and students' understandings of shared classroom
              interactions, and on ways that teachers and students work together to shape the
              teaching and learning of middle school algebra.  The methodology used will be
              qualitative in nature - employing the video analysis of lessons.  Data will be
              collected in three classrooms in Morgan County Georgia (a diverse racial and
              social setting), and the study will have a longitudinal focus where students
              will be followed over the course of their middle school algebra experiences.
