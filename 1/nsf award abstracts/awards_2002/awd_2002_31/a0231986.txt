Abstract    :
              

This GK-12 project supports fellows at the University of Colorado, from the
              departments of Astrophysics, Environmental Biology, and Chemistry, for
              educational activities with 6th-8th graders and 9th-10th graders in the Boulder
              Valley school districts, targeting especially Hispanic populations.  Nine
              graduate students and five advanced undergraduates are supported per year.  The
              themes are adaptation, implementation and enrichment of Full Option Science
              System (FOSS) modules, a modular approach to teaching elementary school
              science.  The microscopic-macroscopic connection in science (biology and
              chemistry) is emphasized.  Partners include the Sombrero Marsh Nature Center,
              the Cooperative Institute for Environmental Science, Thorn Ecological Institute
              and the City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks. The intellectual merit
              is evidenced by the unifying focus on environmental issues.  Broader impacts
              are reflected in the nature of the schools, as many include students in groups
              currently underrepresented in science.  This project is partially supported by
              funds from the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
