Abstract    :
              The Pacific Resources for Education and Learning (PREL) is requesting a planning
              grant for the development of a Masters of Science degree program in Program
              Evaluation as a distance learning program.  The two-year program will offer
              approximately 36-semester credits for courses focused on program evaluation
              theory and techniques, research methods and statistics. The program will be
              modeled after PREL's distance learning MS degree program in Instructional
              Technology and Telecommunications. Courses will be offered in an asynchronous
              online format. Instruction will be self-paced and students will interact with
              faculty and each other through e-mail, videoconferencing and web boards.

The
              PI believes that training in evaluation for personnel in educational settings
              will increase organizational capacity to assess the effectiveness of their
              educational efforts in STEM and lead to improved educational outcomes.
