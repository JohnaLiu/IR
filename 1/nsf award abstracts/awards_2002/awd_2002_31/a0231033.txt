Abstract    :
              Our project is an effort by a multidisciplinary team of engineering faculty
              members at Rowan University to integrate digital imaging technology (DIT) into
              their undergraduate engineering curriculum. It builds upon the experience and
              interest of faculty to promote new topics and innovative methods of teaching.
              Our work is an effort to provide students with the skills directly relevant to
              the evolving needs of the industry and the marketplace. Our project involves
              the development of digital imaging curriculum and focuses on the creation of a
              leading edge digital imaging laboratory/studio to facilitate the use of
              nontraditional learning approaches that encourage interactive learning, team
              building, and creative problem solving among students and instructors. There
              are nine modules adapted, implemented and used to introduce students to the
              multidisciplinary engineering principles and use of DIT. Though our
              dissemination efforts we will encourage other schools to adopt our curriculum
              and modules to enhance their undergraduate curriculum and to promote
              engineering education outreach opportunities.
