This award supports collaborative research between Drs.
              Elizabeth Podlaha and Wanjun Wang of Louisiana State University, Dr. Henrikas
              Cesiulis of Vilnius University in Lithuania, and Dr. Jinhui Lan of Tsinghua
              University in China, in connection with Drs. Podlaha and Wang's Nanoscale
              Science and Engineering NIRT grant (0210832) for development of novel
              electrodeposited nanostructured multilayered alloys for microelectromechanical
              systems (MEMS).  The U.S. researchers will benefit from Dr. Cesiulis' expertise
              in the area of electrodeposition and from Dr. Lan's expertise in the area of
              sensor development.
