This award supports the PI, from New Mexico State University, in
              a collaboration with Michael Thoss of the Department of Theoretical Chemistry
              at the Technical University of Munich, Germany.  Through the collaboration, the
              research will develop theoretical methods and computational techniques for
              studying ultrafast Photo-induced electron transfer reactions in condensed. 
              Specifically, the project aims at development of a self-consistent hybrid
              method to allow non-perturbative simulations of time-resolved nonlinear
              spectroscopic signals for dynamical processes in the condensed phase.  The
              collaboration will also make detailed studies of electron transfer dynamics in
              model systems as well as tests and improvements of commonly used approximation
              methods and will compare theoretical results with experimental data.

The
              major focus of the work for the current grant period is the integration of the
              complementary expertise of the German and US PIs in developing the new
              methodology and applying it to transfer processes in chemical, biological, and
              material systems.  Novel applications of the new method will be carried out to
              provide rigorous theoretical interpretations of results of experimental
              femtosecond nonlinear spectroscopy.
