Abstract    :
              
Access Science, a renewed GK-12 project, supports fellows at the University of
              Pennsylvania from the departments of Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics,
              Computer Science and Engineering, for educational activities with grade K-12
              students in the urban public schools in West Philadelphia.  The school
              population is 98% African American.  Penn's Center for Community Partnership
              participates in the project.  Ten graduate students and twenty advanced
              undergraduates are supported per year.  The themes are hands-on and inquiry
              based science, mathematics, engineering and technology.   The nature of the
              schools involved result in a broad impact of this project on populations that
              are currently underrepresented in the sciences, technology, mathematics, and
              engineering professions.  This project is receiving partial support from the
              Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences
