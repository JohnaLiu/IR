Abstract    :
              The standard approach to modeling household intertemporal optimization is to
              assign  a unique utility function to the entire household, derive household
              Euler equations, and then estimate intertemporal elasticities of substitution.
              This research explores the use of individual Euler equations for each household
              member.  The focus is on the identification and estimation of individual Euler
              equations when only total household consumption, individual labor supplies,
              wages, and interest rates are observed. If successful, the research can inform
              several key policy questions, and  can potentially rationalize observed changes
              in family composition and household labor supply.
