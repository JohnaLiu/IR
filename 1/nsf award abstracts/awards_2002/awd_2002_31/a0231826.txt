Abstract    :
              Perceptual learning is defined as experience-induced changes in the way
              information is extracted by these researchers who intend to investigate how
              perceptual learning occurs and whether it has implications for mathematics and
              science learning.  It is the process by which learners differentiate relevant
              structure from irrelevant variation.  The methods of research involve
              experimental investigations of conditions affecting perceptual learning,
              effects of structure discovery, and structure mapping variants of learning
              procedures on transfer.  Experiments will employ objective measures of learning
              such as speed, accuracy, and transfer to novel problems.  They will test and
              apply new learning technology such as automated sequencing algorithms that use
              a learner's speed and accuracy to assess learning and to sequence events for
              optimal efficiency.  

The panel reviewers noted that an investigation that
              might clarify perceptual learning might help supplement or even challenge
              prevailing constructivist theories of learning.  This way of thinking about
              learning could be an important discovery for mathematics and science learning.
