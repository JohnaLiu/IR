Abstract    :
              This proof of concept project targets the improvement of undergraduate
              engineering students' communication skills. Faculty in the School of Industrial
              and System Engineering are working with colleagues in the School of Language,
              Communication, and Culture, and a group of senior advisors, to glean
              information from workplace interviews with practicing engineers, their
              managers, and senior executives. This information forms the basis for a new
              curriculum and course on Technical Communication. Four prototype instructional
              tools that use paper-and-pencil, electronic, video, and web-based media, are
              also being integrated into the course.
