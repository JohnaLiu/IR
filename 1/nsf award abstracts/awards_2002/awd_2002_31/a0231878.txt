Abstract    :
              
This 3-year longitudinal project studies how diverse girls' attitudes,
              perceptions, and experiences in grades 7-12 influence both subtle and explicit
              choices leading towards or away from a college major in science.  Participants
              come from 4 urban and suburban districts whose students represent a range of
              economic background and ethnicities. The design would follow two cohorts of
              students, one from 7th to 10th grade and one from 10th grade into the first
              year of college. The middle school cohort allows a broad look at student
              experiences before they formally enter the pipeline, while the high school
              cohort focuses on those students who are most likely to pursue science and
              engineering careers. The study includes an annual large-scale survey of the
              full cohort and an annual in-depth interview with a continuing subset of
              students. Contextual interviews with selected parents, science teachers,
              guidance counselors, and others are also included. Both quantitative and
              qualitative analysis techniques are used.

This project seeks to explore the
              linkage between school and extracurricular experiences of female students to
              their decision to pursue a science college major. These variables have been
              found to be related to the gender gap in achievement and attitudes about
              science, but a formal linkage between them and girls' decision to pursue a
              science major has not been established. This research has the potential to
              identify factors that might facilitate the recruitment of females in science
              majors.
