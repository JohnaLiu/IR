Abstract    :
              Historically the understanding of biological processes has progressed from
              observation of phenomena at the cellular level to structure determination of
              biopolymers (i.e. DNA/RNA, proteins and polysaccharides) to elucidation of
              specific interactions and reactions that govern life processes. As these
              processes are understood at the molecular and sub-molecular (i.e., functional
              group) levels, the dependence upon interactions of organic molecules and groups
              becomes evident. Consequently, information obtained through study of organic
              reactions and non-covalent interactions among small organic molecules has
              become directly applicable to the understanding of biological processes. To
              facilitate students' understanding of how chemical events dictate live
              processes, three-dimensional interactive animations of reaction pathways for
              multiple enzymatic processes are being developed based upon enzyme crystal
              structure and semi-empirical calculations. The software allows students to
              visualize the chemical events that play a role in these enzyme systems. The
              goal of this Proof-of-Concept project is to correlate the chemical events in
              biological processes with those learned in organic chemistry courses.
