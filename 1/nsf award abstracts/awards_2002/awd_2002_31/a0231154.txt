Abstract    :
              This project is creating materials to promote conceptual development for
              calculus students, by helping instructors to raise the visibility of the key
              concepts, to stimulate student peer-to-peer discussion of concepts, and to
              connect calculus concepts to what students know and understand about their
              world. In addition to creating materials to enhance student learning, the
              project is investigating the hypothesis that tapping into mathematicians'
              emphasis on conceptual understanding, and their beliefs about how mathematical
              understanding is built, can motivate faculty to experiment with new methods and
              approaches to enhance student learning. In this case the approach is modeled
              after Mazur's reformation of introductory physics course through the use of
              ConcepTests that actively engage students to think about, discuss, and clarify
              their understanding of basic physical concepts. Student peer-teaching is also
              featured.
