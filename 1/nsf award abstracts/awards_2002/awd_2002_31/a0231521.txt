The Department of Mathematics and Statistics of
              Texas Tech
University will host the Spring Topology and Dynamical
              Systems
Conference 2003.  This conference will feature over 20
              invited
speakers and will have special sessions in each of the areas
              of
Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, General Topology, Geometric
Group
              Theory, Geometric Topology and Topological Algebras, as
well as providing
              opportunities for contributed talks.  This
conference will build on a heritage
              of such conferences held
each year since 1967.


This conference will
              provide a forum for an international group
of up to 200 researchers to present
              and discuss the latest research
results and open questions.  Topics covered
              will range over a
broad spectrum but all have a common link to the core of
              topology.
Among topics to be discussed by invited speakers are virtual
knot
              theory, fixed points and periodicity, bottlenecks in
dendroids, indecomposable
              Banach spaces and applications of
topology.  The invited speakers have been
              nominated by a steering
committee of leading researchers in the areas. 
              Graduate student
participation will also be strongly encouraged and
              supported.
