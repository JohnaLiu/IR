Abstract    :
              The project is: establishing a mutually beneficial parallel educational
              partnership between school districts and Syracuse University; leveraging
              Syracuse University research- and practice-generated expertise in STEM
              pedagogy, educational technology integration, and assessment through Graduate
              Teaching Fellows daily participation in the school system; developing
              innovative, process-oriented, standards-based, hands-on STEM curriculum units
              and resources that use local environmental issues to connect teaching basic
              STEM concepts in biology, chemistry, earth sciences, physics, and technology;
              enhancing K-12 teachers' content knowledge through dissemination of new STEM
              teaching resources through print materials and the Web and through professional
              development workshops for science teachers; and establishing content-rich,
              inquiry-based benchmark programs in schools through mutually beneficial
              collaborations between STEM graduate students and science teachers as a
              forerunner for a permanent collaboration model and replicable national model. 
              The broader impact grows from the partnership and collaboration between
              Syracuse University and 18 Onondaga County school districts. Two of these
              school districts, Syracuse City and LaFayette, are classroom sites for the
              project and serve as project centers that share and disseminate initiatives and
              local environmental experiments integrating science with technology. Fellows
              receive extensive training in STEM pedagogy and K-12 science education.
              Materials and resources are being developed for appropriate grade levels. STEM
              activity-based units emphasize science process, inquiry and critical thinking
              skills. In addition, STEM Fellows are providing content-rich training sessions
              for area science teachers.
