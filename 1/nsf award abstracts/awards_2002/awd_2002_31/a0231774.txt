Abstract    :
              This project seeks to provide new understanding of the cognitive and assessment
              conditions that support learning of culturally and linguistically diverse
              children.   The study would examine some prevailing myths about the cause of
              differences in mathematics performance.  The theory for the study is drawn from
              cognitive science theory, constructivism, and socio-cultural theories of
              learning and thus investigates the interaction among cognitive processes and
              the cultural context.  Multiple forms of assessments would be designed.  It
              will show whether assessment formats and design influence the measurement of
              performance, how different assessment methods that reflect the linguistic and
              cultural background of students affect performance, and it will conduct
              multivariate analyses to detect other performance factors.  One goal of the
              study is to provide systematic examination of several explanatory factors of
              student achievement in mathematics for grades 4 to 8.
