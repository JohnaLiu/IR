Abstract    :
              CUNY Graduate School is partnering with the Bronx High School Superintendency of
              the New York City Board of Education, The College Board, and the New York
              Academy of Sciences to address the need to increase the participation of
              low-income and underrepresented minority students in high-school-level Advanced
              Placement (AP) courses in mathematics and sciences, particularly in urban
              schools.  This will have broad impacts not only for New York City, but also for
              other urban school districts eager to challenge all of their students. Project
              activities include:  training for GK-12 Fellows in STEM education so that they
              can play a new role as an AP Fellow; enhancing the abilities of AP teachers of
              science and mathematics to deliver AP courses to urban students; and developing
              an exportable model that can be used by other school districts for increasing
              the successful participation of urban students in AP courses. The Graduate
              Fellows are assisting 20 new or novice AP teachers of science and mathematics
              and both are receiving intensive summer and academic-year training and support
              including College Board Summer Institutes, and workshops on such topics as
              science and mathematics content, inquiry-based instruction, science and math
              standards, educational technology as applied to formatting, AP course
              instruction, and post-secondary programs and career opportunities in STEM.  In
              addition, of intellectual merit, AP teachers and university faculty who teach
              parallel courses are working together toward improving AP course delivery and
              articulation with post-secondary settings.  This project is partially supported
              by funds from the Directorate for Engineering from the Directorate for Computer
              and Information Science and Engineering.
