An award was granted Dr Gretz of Michigan Technical
              University to develop a workshop on Modern Instrumentation Methods to be held
              during the 2002 Botanical Society of America national meeting. The tools
              scientists use define the science that they are capable of performing to a
              larger degree today than ever before. Knowledge of sophisticated, computer
              integrated instrumentation is essential for the modern biologist. The next
              generation of biologists must become familiar with modern tools such as remote
              sensing instruments, genomic/proteomic technologies and modern imaging methods
              to be well-trained and productive. The Modern Methods Workshop will be held in
              August 2002 in Madison,Wisconsin in conjunction with Botany 2002, a joint
              meeting of several national scientific organizations, at which 1500
              participants are expected. This workshop will provide participants direct
              experience with current methodologies in such diverse areas as aquatic
              robotics, remote sensing, molecular biology and advanced microscopy. The format
              is four 2-3 hour sessions spread over a day. The workshop is designed to
              provide the opportunity for scientists to learn about techniques outside of
              their field of interest at a level of complexity sufficient to encourage
              technology transfer between disciplines. Student participation is encouraged
              through travel and subsistence awards to qualified students.
