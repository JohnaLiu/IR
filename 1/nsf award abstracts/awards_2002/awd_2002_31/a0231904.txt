Abstract    :
              The goals of this evaluative research project are: 1) to review how partnership
              performance is evaluated in the STEM educational community and also in a
              variety of other settings drawn from other policy contexts, industry, and
              not-for-profit; and 2) to develop and test a model exploring how degrees of
              embeddness among partners influence the process by which STEM educational
              outcomes are pursued and achieved.  A panel of STEM evaluation and education
              experts will participate in an online Delphi panel whose goal is to develop an
              evaluative model for linking embedded partnership relations to educational
              outcomes.  This model will be tested with up to four systemic initiatives for
              retrospective insights into partnership activities and with at least two
              ongoing Math and Science Partnership projects.
