Abstract    :
              Invertebrates comprise 95% of all animal life on the Earth and dominate the
              world's oceans so some knowledge of their biology and ecology is fundamental to
              a student's understanding of the planet's ecosystems. Invertebrates are covered
              in many university-level courses ranging from traditional invertebrate zoology
              classes to those emphasizing general introductory biology, marine biology,
              oceanography, and biodiversity, to name a few.  Invertebrates are represented
              by a dizzying array of body forms and morphological
variations as well as
              complex feeding, locomotory, and other behaviors that are difficult to describe
              and illustrate. Virtually all textbooks represent invertebrates with line
              drawings and photographs in an encyclopedic manner that provide students with
              little or no sense of their position and/or behavior in natural habitats. No
              multimedia products are available on the market today that provide students
              with a means to observe most invertebrate groups, their respective body plans
              and behaviors.  This project is developing a prototype interactive CD-ROM
              containing digital videotape sequences of selected living marine invertebrates
              with an emphasis on the body plans and locomotory and feeding behavior of two
              major groups. We are building on several years of experience in videotaping
              living invertebrates under both natural and simulated field conditions and have
              access to a multitude of marine habitats and state-of-the-art culture
              facilities for conducting the project.  The prototype is being tested by
              visiting undergraduate students from 30 universities that use our teaching and
              research facilities. Additional testing of the prototype will occur at a
              national meeting of invertebrate zoologists.
