Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to develop an interest in and capacity for
              evaluative studies of critical STEM issues among faculty at five regional
              colleges in the Mississippi Delta, including three Historically Black Colleges
              and Universities (HBCUs). These colleges were chosen because, although they
              graduate most of the teachers and administrators working in the Delta schools,
              the graduates l have not been routinely involved in the comprehensive
              evaluation of STEM policies and practices. Of particular importance for these
              personnel are issues surrounding student assessment and performance, especially
              in light of new stringent assessment guidelines. The project will prepare
              faculty to investigate large-scale student assessment issues through the
              development of a faculty professional "learning community" mentored by
              nationally recognized evaluators/ researchers. These mentors will serve
              initially as instructors and later as collaborators/consultants to the faculty
              members as they design and implement research proposals on issues in student
              learning through current high stakes testing and accountability procedures.
