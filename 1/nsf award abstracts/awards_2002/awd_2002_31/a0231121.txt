Abstract    :
              For engineering students in introductory system dynamics and controls courses
              that need to gain intuitive feel for physical systems, our distributed
              laboratory is a way to explore basic concepts through a hands-on experience
              that uses inexpensive, custom hardware and software kits. Unlike traditional
              laboratory experiences, our distributed lab kit is brought home by each student
              and tackled on a self-paced schedule in much the same manner as a homework
              assignment, thus allowing each student to customize the laboratory experience
              to his or her learning style. In our pilot project, lab kits whose parts cost
              are less than $100 when purchased in lot sizes of 100 will be designed and
              tested. Our kits contains a controller board based on a standard
              microcontroller chip that implements real-time control and data acquisition
              software and communicates with a host over a serial port. The systems under
              study will be hardware modules that connect to the controller board. The host
              computer will be the student's home PC running a Visual Basic application for
              experiment control. Twenty-five kits with a motor-driven inertia hardware
              module, an electrical network plus speaker module and a cantilever beam module
              will be constructed and given to undergraduate mechanical engineering students
              in the beginning system dynamics course as part of their regular curriculum.
              Our evaluation plan will assess project progress, views of the students and
              other stakeholders about the distributed lab, and the impact of the lab on
              student learning.
