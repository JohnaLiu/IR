Abstract    :
              The objectives of this study are to examine the role that state instructional
              policies play in shaping school learning environments.  The PI we use a
              multi-level random effects model to evaluate differences in state mathematics
              instructional policy, including content standards, curriculum frameworks, and
              teacher professional learning, with particular emphasis on the implications for
              low income children. Examine how differences in state mathematics instructional
              policy are associated with school learning environment, especially in high
              poverty schools. The PI will also examine how school learning environment is
              associated with classroom instructional practices. And finally, the PI will
              identify the relationships between family income, parental investment, school
              learning environment, and classroom instructional practices on growth in
              mathematical proficiencies through the third grade.
