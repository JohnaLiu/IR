Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the
              development of a unique, scalable membrane pervaporation process that can be
              used in a wide array of separations that are of national and economic
              importance.  This research will demonstrate the technical viability of a novel
              pervaporation system, which generates its vacuum by passing a special working
              fluid through a Venturi nozzle. More specifically it will show that an
              intermediate cat naphtha stream having up to 2000 ppm sulfur can be selectively
              separated into (1) an aromatic-rich permeate fraction that contains almost all
              of the sulfur-bearing molecules and (2) a virtually sulfur-free saturate-rich
              retentate fraction that contains almost all of the olefins. A small scale
              laboratory system will be used to generate permeation rate and quality data on
              model feeds using membranes that have previously been shown to have high
              aromatic/aliphatic selectivities. 

One application of particular interest is
              the reduction of sulfur in gasoline. The National Petroleum Council has
              estimated that it will cost U.S. refiners $8 billion in 1998 dollars to meet
              the 30 ppm Tier 2 requirement for sulfur in gasoline, primarily because of the
              limitations of existing commercial hydrotreaters. If successfully demonstrated,
              this technology could be used in tandem with existing hydrotreaters worldwide
              to allow refiners to more cost effectively meet lowered sulfur specifications
              for gasoline.
