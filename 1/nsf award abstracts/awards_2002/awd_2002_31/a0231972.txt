Abstract    :
              
This is a planning project that focuses on evaluation capacity building for
              Native Americans in the area of environmental science. It proposes to develop a
              culture-based curriculum on evaluation in Native American contexts through a
              partnership between Kansas State University and Haskell Indian Native
              University.
