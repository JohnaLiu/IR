Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Phase I research project seeks to
              investigate the feasibilty of a novel 3D ear-shape recogniton system for
              enhancing the performance of video-based human identification (ID) systems in
              protecting highly secured facilities. Human ears are highly complex 3D
              structures that offer a rich set of features that can be used as effective
              biometric properties for video-based surveillance and identification of human
              subjects.
     Genex Technologies' proffered "3D Ear ID" technique would
              significantly advance the current identification and surveillance capability
              and greatly enhance the protection of U.S. forces/civilians and facilities, at
              home and abroad.
