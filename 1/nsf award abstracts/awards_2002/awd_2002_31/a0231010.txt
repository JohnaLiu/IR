This award supports the PI and postdoctoral and graduate
              students from the University of Utah in a collaboration with Felix von Oppen of
              the Department of Physics at the Free University of Berlin, Germany.  Combining
              complementary expertise, the German and US groups will make a theoretical study
              of Coulomb drag between low-density electron systems.  A crucial element of the
              research is the use of Monte Carlo methods in simulation, which is a technique
              the German side specializes, and the simulations will be carried out in Berlin.
               Coulomb drag has garnered interests from both theorists and experimentalists
              in the past few years because it reveals makes measurement of intra-layer
              electron correlation possible.

The project also has an educational
              objective.  The project will allow postdocs and graduate students from the
              University to gain experience with Monte Carlo simulations during the summer at
              the Free University.  Besides exposing them to one of the foremost groups in
              Monte Carlo techniques, this will also make them more competitive in the global
              job market.
