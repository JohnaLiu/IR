Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates and
              develops techniques to determine the privacy risk to databases and data sets. 
              The research results in the implementation of a suite of techniques, Privacy
              and Risk Mitigation Assessment Tool (PARMAT), to quantitatively assess data
              privacy and to mitigate risk.  A prototype implementation is developed to test
              and demonstrate the feasibility of the techniques and methods. 

Privacy is a
              growing concern especially with the proliferation of personal information in
              electronic format, making it easier to access and gather individual-specific
              information.  The tools and techniques developed during Phase I will be of
              interest to a wide variety of users that must protect the privacy of personal
              information stored electronically.  The Health Insurance Portability and
              Accountability Act (HIPAA) provides a set of standards for protecting the
              privacy of Americans' personal health records. The new regulation requires the
              protection of personal health information maintained by health care providers,
              hospitals, health plans, health insurers, and health care clearinghouses.  The
              US Department of Health and Human Services estimates the cost to industry
              associated with the privacy regulation implementation for HIPAA to be $17.6
              billion.  While the company only addresses one segment of healthcare
              information privacy, the market potential for the proffered technology is
              considerable.
