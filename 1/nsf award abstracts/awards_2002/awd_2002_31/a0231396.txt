Abstract    :
              The goal of the workshop is to bring together a multidisciplinary group of
              researchers to identify promising research directions in authentication,
              information hiding, and related areas.  The researchers come from diverse
              communities including: signal processing, information theory, coding theory,
              cryptography, and computer science.  Each researcher will present a 20-minute
              talk followed by questions from the audience.  There will also be a few short
              panel-type sessions in which everyone participates.
