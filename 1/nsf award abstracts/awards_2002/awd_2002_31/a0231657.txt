Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a Summer School on Applications of Advanced
              mathematical and Computational Methods to Atmospheric and Oceanic Problems
              (MCAO 2003), which will be held at the National Center for Atmospheric Research
              (NCAR) at Boulder, Colorado, during the time period of July 14 to 26, 2003. 
              This interdisciplinary summer school will bring together specialists of
              atmosphere and ocean sciences, and applied mathematicians interested in such
              problems.  The purpose of this school is to provide to graduate students and
              young researchers of one field the basic elements of the other fields, as well
              as some more advanced openings into current research.  It is also hoped in this
              way to initialize or further develop the communication and interactions between
              specialists of different fields speaking different languages, conducting
              different methodologies but interested sometimes in the same problems.  Many of
              the proposed lecturers have participated in earlier conferences on mathematical
              problems in atmosphere and ocean sciences, and they have already invested into
              interactions between mathematics, computing and geosciences.  Most of the
              requested funding will be devoted to support the students and the lecturers.
