Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a
              laser treatment to crystallize amorphous quasicrystalline (QC) coatings on
              thermally sensitive engineering substrates.  Application of these materials has
              been limited by the high temperature-annealing requirement, which restricts
              their deposition of super alloys and ceramic materials only.  In the program,
              it is proposed to develop laser treatment of amorphous sputter-deposited QC
              coatings to provide localized thermal energy to the coated region only.  This
              will enable the amorphous-to-crystalline conversion, while not degrading the
              load-carrying capability of the underlying substrate materials (Aluminum,
              Titanium, and bearing steel allows).  The spectral reflectance of a-QC
              sputtered coatings will be measured to select the appropriate laser (and
              wavelength) for processing, laser glazing trials will be conducted, and then
              the microstructure and mechanical/tribological properties of the crystallized
              QC films will be characterized.  Results will be briefed to major diesel engine
              manufacturers.

Quasicrystalline materials offer a unique combination of
              material properties; low friction, high hardness, and low thermal conductivity,
              which makes them ideal coatings for non-galling tools for aluminum forming,
              engine drive-train components, and aluminum engine block cylinder surfaces.
