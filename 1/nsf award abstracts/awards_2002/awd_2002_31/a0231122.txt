Abstract    :
              The high priority that information security education warrants has been
              recognized since the early 1990's. To address these national needs, many
              universities have incorporated computer and information security courses into
              their undergraduate and graduate curricula. In these courses, students learn
              how to design, implement, analyze, test, and operate a system or a network to
              achieve the security. Pedagogical research has shown that elective laboratory
              exercises are critically important to the success of this type of courses.
              However, such elective laboratories do not exist in computer security
              education. 

This project fills this gap, namely to develop elective
              laboratory exercises for computer security courses. We are developing an
              instructional operating system (SEINIX); each exercise requires students to add
              a different security mechanism into the system. The instructional system is
              designed in such a way that makes it easy for students to focus on the part of
              the system related to the security concepts that we want them to learn.

The
              Center for Support of Teaching and Learning at Syracuse University will help us
              in evaluating the electiveness of our approach.
