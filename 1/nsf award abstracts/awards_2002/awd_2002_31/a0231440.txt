Abstract    :
              The objective of the project is to develop a PC and Web based interactive
              "Systems and Controls" E-Book to address multidisciplinary curricular needs in
              Electrical, Mechanical, and Aerospace Engineering, and Mathematics. This E-book
              supports undergraduate controls curriculum classes such as differential
              equations, microprocessors, linear algebra, and senior design. It enables
              multidisciplinary curricular integration via case studies, and bridges theory
              and practice by using realistic design problems and capstone projects. It also
              enhances student learning through interactive modeling/simulation in MATLAB
              with 3D animation, interactive problems containing real-time solutions, case
              studies, and interactive multimedia topical lectures. It provides an enriched
              interactive learning experience which facilitates conveying
              fundamental/advanced concepts, asynchronous learning, and different teaching
              and learning styles. Multiple test sites, university and industrial partners,
              publishers, and an assessment specialist contribute to the development of this
              E-book.
