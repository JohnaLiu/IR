Designer Molecules for
              Biosensor Application

A two-day workshop to explore the feasibility of the
              state-of-the-art and potential short-term and long-term technology that can be
              used to quickly detect pathogenic microorganisms is being held at the Cold
              Spring Harbor Laboratory.  In particular, merits of various technologies, based
              on genomic-expression (mRNA), genome structure (DNA/RNA), protein structure an
              other physical and geometric properties are compared.  The multi-disciplinary
              collaborations of computer scientists, biologist, engineering, and biochemist
              is expected to in order to facilitate and advance in science of protein arrays
              for understanding cellular processes, detectors for monitoring single cells,
              and monitoring of pathogenic agents.
