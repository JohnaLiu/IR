Abstract    :
              In this research, Real-time Traffic Adaptive Systems are modeled as Feedback
              Control Systems, where new decisions (the "phasing" in traffic network signal
              control and the ramp-metering rates in freeway control) are implemented based
              on "feedback" from sensors that monitor traffic.  The feedback includes (i) a
              measurement system, (ii) a system that estimates/predicts traffic, and (iii) a
              decision/control system that computes appropriate decision/controls.  In
              developing these systems, issues are raised on (i) the design of the feedback
              control system, (ii) the stability of the system, and (iii) the
              "responsiveness" of the system.  The research will address these issues and
              particularly focus on:  (1) Characterizing the communication/computational
              delays in the feedback (including the computational cycle of getting
              measurements, processing them, executing the embedded  decision-making
              algorithms, processing the result, and downloading it to decision actuators
              /signals), (2) Characterizing the effect of design parameters in the feedback,
              such as "decision horizon", "control update interval", and "space-time
              resolution" of  the decision-making algorithms, (3) Studying the stability of
              the system, in the sense does it go to an "equilibrium" or does it "cycle" in
              the limit, and (4) Investigating how well the feedback system responds to
              temporary short-term conditions (incidents, traffic surges, etc.) and slow
              varying long-term changes (e.g., gradual changes in the overall traffic
              volumes). 

In addition to basic research contributions and involvement of
              PhD students in the effort, it is anticipated that (1) the results on stability
              and responsiveness of traffic adaptive systems will be introduced into
              curricula, and (2) the analysis of the traffic adaptive systems would be very
              useful to USDOT and traffic agencies that are planning to implement state
              of-the-art systems within their jurisdictions.
