Abstract    :
                   This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on the
              production of grain boundary doped thin film mixed ionic - electronic
              conductors for optimized oxygen separation membranes. Ion transport properties
              of mixed conducting ceramics will be studied as a function of controlled grain
              boundary doping. Ceramics known to perform well for O2 separation will be doped
              with magnesium for increased performance. Doped thin films will be prepared,
              tested, and compared to un-doped films and films doped in the bulk rather than
              the grain boundary. Cost effective grain boundary doping will be accomplished
              through a tape casting procedure used to produce thin films which can be
              laminated onto porous supports for increased strength. O2 separation will be
              maximized while minimizing the amount of dopant used. Test structures will be
              mechanically characterized for strength and durability. 
     A cost efficient
              method of separating O2 from air would be beneficial in a number of industries.
              Chemical industries would benefit from a cheap source of oxygen for the
              synthesis of value added chemicals; manufacturing industries such as steel,
              glass and paper, for example, would be able to heat furnaces more efficiently
              with an oxidant undiluted by nitrogen; and the energy industry would see
              improved performance in processes such as coal gasification and conversion of
              natural gas to syngas.
