Abstract    :
              The Cornell Science Inquiry Partnerships (CSIP) will involve graduate fellows
              working with science teachers in grades 7-12 in rural and urban schools in
              upstate NY. CSIP will have a broad disciplinary base, incorporating fellows
              from the Colleges of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Arts and Sciences, and
              Engineering. Through CSIP, middle school and high school students will be
              engaged in three types of inquiry: (1) open-ended explorations of unexplained
              phenomena, (2) highly structured investigations that proceed toward known
              outcomes and are designed to teach specific concepts or principles, and (3)
              activities that lead to an understanding of the nature of scientific research,
              (e.g., the importance of peer review). Fellows also will teach specific
              concepts related to their research, the students' inquiry projects, and
              required course content. GK-12 fellows will develop leadership, mentoring, and
              teaching skills; the ability to work in multidisciplinary teams; and
              partnerships with faculty, peers, and teachers--all of which will aid them in
              their research and future employment. Teachers will enhance their ability to
              guide student researchers and will develop collaborations with universy faculty
              and community organizations. Through CSIP, university students, faculty, and
              high school and middle school teachers will develop long-term partnerships,
              create new approaches to enhance inquiry learning, and update science content
              taught in secondary schools. An important outcome of CSIP will be that these
              new instructional materials and models can be disseminated for the benefit of
              other students and teachers nationwide.
