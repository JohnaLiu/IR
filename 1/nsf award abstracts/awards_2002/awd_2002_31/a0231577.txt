Abstract    :
              This US-Croatian workshop on biocomplexity and sustainable ecosystem management
              will take place in Dubrovnik, Croatia, during October 1-6, 2002. The U.S.
              organizers are Carl Hershner and Anamarija Frankic from the College of William
              and Mary Virginia Institute of Marine Science.  Their Croatian counterparts are
              Vera Zutic of the Rudjer Boskovic Institute, Zagreb, and Adam Benovic of the
              Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries, Dubrovnik.  The workshop goal is to
              define an interdisciplinary approach to research on and management of
              biologically complex ecosystems in the Adriatic Sea, where natural and human
              systems are interdependent. 

The Dubrovnik meeting will bring together U.S.
              and Croatian researchers who have direct knowledge of the Adriatic and the
              Chesapeake Bay and possess complementary expertise in coastal and marine
              ecosystems research or social and economic sciences. Workshop discussions will
              feature: 1) the functioning of large scale coastal ecosystems, 2) sustainable
              human interaction, 3) biodiversity changes, and 4) socio-economic implications
              of management options.   Results are expected to lead to a refined theoretical
              framework for innovative collaborative projects that integrate field studies
              and employ suitable biological, hydrologic, and socio-economic models for the
              purpose of understanding and managing similarly complex marine systems around
              the globe. 
. 
This biocomplexity workshop project fulfills the program
              objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United
              States and South Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share
              research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.
