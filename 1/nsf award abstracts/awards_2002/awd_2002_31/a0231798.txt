Abstract    :
              This award supports the intial phase of a planned 4 year project that seeks to
              investigate, develop, and report on the technical and scientific merit of
              designing and deploying, at scale, very small integrated environmental
              monitoring systems.  These will consist of integrated digital radios, sensors,
              and power systems that are able to link to the internet for bi-directional data
              flow, and to link to such projected research networks as the planned national
              ecological observatory network (NEON).  This entire project has as its goal the
              development of an entirely new scalable paradigm of no-license networked
              wireless connectivity. The initial work, to be funded through this award, will
              entail developing design parameters for classes of very small radios integrated
              with networking protocols, miniaturized configurable processors,
              interchangeable sensors, and advanced power supplies.   An important component
              of the effort will be a first-hand assessment of the needs of field researchers
              working in a variety of ecosystems and physical environments.   This
              project,which is made possible by recent advances in electromagnetic wave
              propagation and evolving rules for no-license use of digital radios, has the
              potential to give access to principal researchers, collaborators, students, and
              the general public to raw, as well as processed and stored, field data - in the
              form of numbers, audio, and video. It will also introduce large numbers of
              people to the potential of advanced wireless technology for science.
