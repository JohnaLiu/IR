This award enables Professor Jan Miller and several graduate
              students of the Department of Metallurgical Engineering of the University of
              Utah to collaborate actively with Dr. Anh Nguyen and his group at the
              University of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.  The focus of their joint
              research is the self-assembly of surfactants at solid-liquid and gas-liquid
              interfaces and how these self-assembled nanostructures change interfacial
              properties.  They are developing quantitative models for the self-assembly of
              surfactants which they will test experimentally. They will also determine the
              associated interfacial properties that would influence some industrial
              processes such as wafer cleaning and minerals processing.  The collaborative
              research exploits the complementary research expertise of the principle
              investigators in interfacial properties and particle interactions (Newcastle)
              and in-situ nanostructure imaging and surface force measurements by Atomic
              Force Microscopy, among other techniques (Utah). Their planned research is
              likely to contribute to the fields of particle science and surface chemistry by
              providing the basis for greater control over interfacial properties and thereby
              a means for improving surface chemistry-based industrial processes.
