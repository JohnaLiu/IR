VORTEX TUBES, SPIRALS AND THE LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION OF TURBULENCE
This
              study aims to further develop the idea of the stretched vortex as the
              fundamental element for both the modeling of the fine-scales of turbulence and
              for the building of structure-based subgrid-scale models for the Large-Eddy
              Simulation (LES) of turbulent flows. The challenge is to develop a unified
              description of the small-scale dynamics and their effect on the larger scales
              in realistic turbulent flow at large Reynolds numbers. This modeling approach
              will be applied to the construction of a special subgrid scale model for the
              near-wall region of turbulent flow, to the LES of trailing vortices and to the
              study of velocity-scalar correlations in turbulent mixing. The research to be
              conducted will include:
(1) development and testing of a special subgrid-scale
              model for the near-wall region of wall-bounded turbulent flows. A quantitative
              description of this process is developed based on the distortion/winding of the
              local mean spanwise shear by a nearly longitudinal sublayer vortex. 
(2) LES
              of complex unsteady flows with high large-scale strain, such as the turbulent
              trailing vortex at high Reynolds number. This involves the evolution of a
              highly anisotropic, unsteady flow with mean streamline curvature that is
              subject to strong internal large-scale rotation and strain. The proposed LES
              will use realistic initial conditions combined with a model for the production,
              inside the vortex core, of axial flow generated by an induced axial pressure
              gradient.
(3) application of the stretched-spiral-vortex model of turbulence
              small scales to the analysis of velocity-scalar correlations in homogeneous
              turbulence in the presence of a mean scalar gradient. 
These application areas
              are chosen because they represent, respectively, important problems in the
              modeling, computation, and analysis of turbulent flows at large Reynolds
              numbers.
