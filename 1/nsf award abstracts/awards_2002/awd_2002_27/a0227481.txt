Abstract    :
              This project will utilize data obtained from Low Earth Orbiting (LEO)
              satellites, in particular the DMSP satellites, as well as electric field data
              obtained from the SuperDARN radars to infer a number of features of the
              magnetosphere.  The goal is to create hemispheric views of plasma regimes, the
              location of convection reversals and field aligned current structures.  By
              utilizing data obtained simultaneously from satellites and SuperDARN it will be
              possible to study these features in a boundary-oriented fashion that will
              clarify their interrelationship.  Quantitative values of the average energy and
              precipitating energy flux will be given for each region for both electrons and
              ions.  Quantitative maps will be generated for the regions and the new maps
              will separately catalog the open and closed portions of the Low Latitude
              Boundary Layer (LLBL).  The maps will include the plasma boundaries, the nature
              of the precipitating fluxes, the field aligned currents and the convection
              reversal boundaries.
