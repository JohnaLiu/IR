The goal of the
              workshop is to bring together a multidisciplinary group of researchers to
              identify promising research directions in authentication, information hiding,
              and related areas. The researchers come from diverse communities including:
              signal processing, information theory, coding theory, cryptography, and
              computer science. Each researcher will present a 20-minute talk followed by
              questions from the audience. There will also be a few short panel-type sessions
              in which everyone participates.  There will also be representatives from NSF
              and possibly other federal agencies (NSA, DARPA).
