Abstract    :
              In recent years, many models of flow in the upper mantle beneath the oceans have
              been developed including plume upwelling and swell formation at hotspots,
              small-scale convection beneath plates, mantle flow
and melt migration beneath
              fast and slow spreading centers, channelized mantle flow from hotspots to
              spreading centers, convective overturn above subducting plates, asthensopheric
              flow associated with propagating rifts, downwelling beneath the
              Australian-Antarctic discordance, return flow from
trenches to ridges, and
              flow around subducting slabs during trench rollback.  Now, for the first time,
              we are entering an era when these often speculative models of mantle dynamics
              can be tested and refined with
measurements in the oceans that have the power
              to resolve subsurface structure at the critical length scales.  The
              establishment of a U.S. National Ocean Bottom Seismometer Instrument Pool with
              a total of more than
100 long-duration, wide-band instruments provides an
              opportunity for progress in understanding the dynamics of flow in the upper
              mantle beneath the oceans.

The first Ocean Mantle Dynamics community
              workshop will be held September 18-20, 2002 in Snowbird, Utah.  This workshop
              has five major objectives: (1) highlight the science that can be done by the
              program, (2) develop a plan for "leapfrogging arrays", (3) define the design
              and technical requirements for an offshore component to USArray, (4) describe
              program needs in other areas like geodynamic modeling, petrology/geochemistry
              and laboratory measurements, and (5) descuss the relationship of the program to
               other major geoscience initiatives.
