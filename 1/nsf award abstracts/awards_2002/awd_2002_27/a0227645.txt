ABSTRACT

The
              proposed project is on fabrication of well-ordered coated monodispersed Fe
              nanoparticle arrays with enhanced magnetic and electronic coupling between
              particles.  This will result in collective phenomena such as exchange
              ferromagnetism, insulator-to-metal transition, and extremely large
              magnetoresistance.  The PI is focusing her effort in this project on
              preparation of ultrathin but impermeable coatings on Fe nanoparticles, precise
              control over interparticle spacing, nanoscale structure-property relationships
              and their correlation to larger length scales.
