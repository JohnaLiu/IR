Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop a methodology for measuring
              atmospheric fluxes of soluble nitrogen compounds.  The system will first be
              developed and used to measure nitrous acid (HONO) fluxes at the forest of the
              University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS) in conjunction with the
              atmospheric chemistry program PROPHET (Program for Research on Oxidants: 
              PHotochemistry, Emissions, and Transport).  These measurements will provide
              information on the importance of forest surfaces as a source of HONO to the
              atmosphere.  Later the method could be expanded to cover other soluble chemical
              species.  The long-term goal of the PI and his collaborators is to understand
              fluxes of nitrogen constituents to and from forest ecosystems, the effect of
              atmospheric constituents on ecological processes, and conversely, the effect of
              emissions on the chemistry of the atmosphere.
