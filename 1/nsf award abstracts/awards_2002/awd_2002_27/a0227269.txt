Abstract    :
              The project is proposed by a partnership formed between Indiana
              University-Bloomington and nine urban school corporations, (the Indiana
              Initiative Mathematics Consortium.).  There are a total of 126 elementary
              schools (57 Title I), 36 middle schools and 24 high schools in the districts
              serving over 115,000 students.  There are two major foci (i) providing
              comprehensive professional development for leadership cadres of teachers and
              principals; and (ii) insuring that all IMI districts will derive permanent
              benefit from a major overhaul of the preservice preparation of elementary and
              high school teachers by the university.  Specifically the partnership is to
              establish linkages between IU's preservice program and IMI districts to enhance
              the ability of the districts to both attract and retain qualified mathematics
              teachers.

One component of the project is the identification of a leadership
              cadre (390 elementary and 60 middle grades teachers) to effectively pilot a
              mathematics curriculum, selected by the partners for its alignment with state
              academic mathematics standards, in order to improve student achievement.  The
              project will use student performance data on the state ISTEP assessment
              examinations as a major measure of the effectiveness of the elementary pilot
              project.  A second component is the high school plan with the identification of
              a leadership cadre of 90 high school mathematics teachers and 30 eighth grade
              mathematics teachers.  These teachers are to pilot selected units in their
              classrooms in order that the current curriculum is better aligned with state
              standards and ISTEP.
