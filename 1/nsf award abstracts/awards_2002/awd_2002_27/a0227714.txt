The Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE) and the Society
              of Systematic
Biologists (SSB) are the premier Societies in the US for
              discussion and
dissemination of ideas relating to evolution. This proposal
              will provide
travel costs, registration costs, and lodging costs to
              approximately 15
minority undergraduates for the annual meetings of these
              societies for the
years 2003 - 2006.  These undergraduates will also present
              posters at the
meetings.  The proposal is an outgrowth of a pilot program
              conducted at
the 2001 meetings which raised awareness and enthusiasm for the
              need to
broaden the undergraduate base at the meetings.  During the meetings
              the
undergraduates will be mentored by graduate student and faculty
              mentors,
who will help the undergraduate network at the meetings, help
              demystify
talks for the undergraduates, and generally make the students feel
              more
welcome at the meetings.  There will also be an official mentoring
              session
for undergraduates, consisting of a 'pep-talk'/seminar that will
              help
encourage the students to prepare for careers and/or graduate school
              in
evolutionary/environmental biology.  These activities will be
              supplemented
by social activities not covered by this grant, as well as
              further efforts
on the part of both societies for encouraging undergraduate
              participation,
such as reduced registration fees, daily fees for attendance by
              students
at the host site, and an undergraduate poster session.  These
              activities
will help increase the amount of minority and other
              undergraduate
participation at the meetings, and ultimately should have a
              positive
effect on minority participation in evolutionary biology
              nationally.
