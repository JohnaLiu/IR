Abstract    :
              Dr. Robert Gray has a long track record of mentoring women in electrical
              engineering through their Ph.D. programs and in their careers.  The impact of
              these accomplishments is clear from the achievements and credentials of the
              graduates.  He is attuned to the needs of women pursuing degrees in engineering
              and has created a learning environment where all of his students can excel to
              their fullest potential.  His mentoring activities also carry over to the
              department and institution; Dr. Gray has been proactive at influencing his
              colleagues in their behavior as well.
