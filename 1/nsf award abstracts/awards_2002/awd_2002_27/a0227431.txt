Abstract    :
              Individual doctoral training programs in social psychology cannot span the broad
              range of concepts, content areas, and methodological skills that define the
              field. Even the very best graduate students tend to have significant gaps in
              what they know and what type of research they are prepared to do. To address
              the training needs of contemporary students of social psychology, the Society
              for Personality and Social Psychology has initiated a new Summer Institute in
              Social Psychology. The summer institutes provide graduate students and
              early-career professionals with two weeks of intensive instruction and
              supervision from senior social psychologists, and important opportunities for
              professional development and networking. The biennial summer institutes are
              staffed by leading researchers and modeled after the successful summer programs
              organized by the European Association of Experimental Social Psychology. The
              institutes are coordinated by an advisory committee appointed and overseen by
              the Society for Personality and Social Psychology. This grant provides support
              for the first three summer institutes during the summers of 2003, 2005, and
              2007.
