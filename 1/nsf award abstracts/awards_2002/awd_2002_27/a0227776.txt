Abstract    :
              Enrique Barrera is a Hispanic engineer who is making significant strides in both
              mentoring and in research, with his efforts reaching down into K-12.  He
              includes undergraduate and graduate students in his activities modeling what
              mentoring can be. The numbers of students impacted is quite large in light of
              his very active research career and the other duties he has undertaken with
              undergraduate and graduate students. His work is exemplary. The data and
              numbers are impressive; the impact is broad and deep.
