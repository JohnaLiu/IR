Abstract    :
              The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), through its
              education reform initiative Project 2061, will partner with Northwestern
              University, the University of Michigan, and Michigan State University to create
              a Center for Learning and Teaching that focuses on research and development
              issues related to improving curriculum materials for K-12 science.  This new
              Center for Instructional Materials in Science will serve a critical national
              need to help all students achieve science literacy.  It will help to foster a
              new generation of leadership with specific expertise in the analysis of
              curriculum materials and in their development, evaluation and implementation.
              The new Center will focus on three main goals:  1) to develop the national
              instructional materials development infrastructure at the doctoral and
              postdoctoral level; 2) to provide relevant inservice and/or preservice training
              to science teachers and other professionals; and 3) to conduct research on
              questions related to instructional materials for science at the highest level. 
              The project plans to enroll 30 Ph. D. students (most of whom will be supported
              for three years under this award) and support the professional development of
              an additional 30 postdoctoral students.  The professional development program
              will impact 400 science teachers and will foster the professional development
              of 30 other teachers, training them to become teacher leaders.
