Abstract    :
              The sensors used to measure neural activities are currently based on direct
              attachment of the electrodes to the nerve or the nerve bundle.  Although this
              method has been very effective, there are serious limitations, most significant
              is the intrusive nature of the process.  For example, to use electrodes for
              simulation or as a sensor to detect signals in the brain, it is necessary to
              open the skull to attach the electrodes to the nerves.  It is highly desirable
              to develop a method that can be used with least intrusion in diagnostics and
              therapeutic activities of the brain.   The idea presented by the PI in this
              exploratory proposal is to measure the nervous activities by inserting
              electrodes in the blood capillaries adjacent to the nerve.  The hypothesis is
              that since the blood plasma and the extracellular fluid are in ionic and
              osmotic equilibrium, the nervous activity signals propagate into the adjacent
              capillaries and, therefore, can by detected with electrodes placed inside the
              capillaries.
