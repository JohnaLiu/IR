Abstract    :
              Using background atmospheric states based upon the latest observations from
              space-bourne and ground-based platforms, re-analyses, and empirical models,
              global climatologies of monthly planetary wave activity in the mesosphere and
              lower thermosphere (MLT) will be produced using a linear planetary wave model.
              Predictions will be made for realistic lower atmospheric and in-situ forcing
              conditions. Electronic datasets, consisting of the model outputs, the blended
              mean states, and diagnostic parameters will be made available to the Aeronomy
              community. Model predictions will be constrained by observations of planetary
              waves in the MLT region. Classical wave propagation theory will be tested and
              exceptions noted and extensions provided.
