We propose
              to show that non-photorealistic renderings which exhibit meaningful
              abstraction
are easily understood. Abstract images are designed to make
              meaningful structure clear. We have
worked on the interactive transformation
              of photographs into versions which manifest meaningful
abstraction by drawing
              on eye movement data [DeCarlo & Santella SIGGRAPH 2002, Santella &
DeCarlo
              NPAR 2002]. Over the next year, we intend to carry out psychophysical
              experiments that
could both validate our interactive technique, and provide
              new ways of learning more about human
vision eye movements, in
              particular.
This is high-risk research. Non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) is
              an established field, but has
never been evaluated. Psychophysical methods are
              typically applied to simple patterns (i.e. dots
and blobs). However, our
              method already involves a close link between NPR and perception
              and
psychophysics, and our lab maintains close connections with
              psychophysicists including Eileen
Kowler and Thomas Papathomas (both are, like
              us, affiliated with the Rutgers Center for Cognitive
Science). Many simple
              conjectures and experiments can be stated naturally in our framework;
              we
believe we can obtain compelling results.
