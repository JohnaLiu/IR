Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) award by the Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by
              Professor Theodore J. Burkey at the University of Memphis to prepare
              light-driven molecules that undergo reversible sub-picosecond isomerizations
              with unit quantum yields.  These molecules are potential devices in optical
              switches, digital memory or light-driven computers.  The molecules are designed
              to function by exchange of chelated ligands through an isomerization based on
              ring opening followed by the formation of another chelate ring.  Ligands, metal
              centers and chelate rings will be designed so that the photochemically driven
              isomerization is ultrafast and efficient to the exclusion of all other
              processes.  Organometallic compounds based on cymatrene-type complexes will be
              studied to analyze important structural features.  Two types of rotational
              motion around a single carbon-carbon bond will be studied:  1) A conrotary
              motion of different geminal functional groups on a single side chain, and 2) A
              disrotary motion of different vicinal functional groups on a ring that formally
              is a two side-chain derivative.  Selected compounds will be examined by
              ultrafast IR to determine the mechanism of isomerization, participation of
              solvent and dissociated ligands, and the time scale of related
              processes.

Molecules for potential use in light-driven electronic devices
              will be studied.  These studies will provide a fundamental understanding of
              ultrafast processes of photochemical bond breaking and subsequent bond
              formation.
