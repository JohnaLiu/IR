Abstract    :
              In this MSP project, the University of Rochester partners with the Greece,
              Penfield and Rush-Henrietta School Districts as well as a consortium of
              twenty-three rural districts through the Genesee Valley Board of Cooperative
              Educational Services (GVBOCES) in an effort to develop effective ways to foster
              the mathematical content knowledge necessary for a successful implementation of
              reform mathematics curricula.  The three suburban Rochester districts are in
              various stages of the adoption and implementation of curricula while the rural
              districts are in the early stages of a curricular reform process. Together, the
              districts in this partnership serve roughly 28,000 students.  Other partners in
              this work are the Education Development Center, Horizon Research and
              WestEd.

For curricular reform to succeed, the partners believe that multiple
              constituencies need to be engaged in practices that enhance mathematical
              knowledge including K-12 teachers and other school support personnel, parents
              and other influential community members, and mathematicians and mathematics
              educators who prepare future teachers.  To this end, they will:
*	Offer a
              series of reform mathematics courses, each focusing on different sets of
              mathematical concepts addressed by the adopted curricula and targeted to the
              various constituencies in such a manner that they will experience learning
              mathematics similar to ways in which students learn the discipline;
*	Train
              teacher leaders to facilitate mathematics case discussions involving in-depth
              analysis of student thinking; and
*	Engage various groups in evening chats
              about school mathematics reform, with a special emphasis on understanding goals
              and expectations for student learning of mathematics; chats will involve
              different combinations of mathematicians, mathematics educators, K-12 teachers,
              parents and community members.
