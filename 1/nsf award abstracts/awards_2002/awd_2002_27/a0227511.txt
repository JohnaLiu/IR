This two-year award for US-UK-Netherlands collaboration
              involves Lisa Levin of the University of California's Scripps Institution of
              Oceanography, Craig Smith of the University of Hawaii, Greg Cowie at the
              University of Edinburgh, Jack Middelburg of the Netherlands' Institute of
              Ecology and others. They propose to study biological and geochemical processes
              in oxygen minimum zones (OMZs).  These are extreme and widely distributed ocean
              environments and deep-sea habitats. The proposed studies involve research
              cruises in the Indus Margin, where the OMZ intersects the sea floor.   Through
              sediment sampling, the investigators will study impacts of low oxygen on
              food-web structure and dynamics, sediment geochemistry, and carbon burial. They
              will use stable-isotopic, radiochemical, biogeochemical and faunal measurements
              to characterize shifts in ecosystem functions and faunal adaptations along a
              seafloor transect. Sampling will take place at 6 stations (100-2000 m depth)
              ranging from fully oxic to permanently hypoxic conditions during monsoon and
              inter monsoon periods.  The project takes advantage of British and Dutch
              complementary expertise.  They will make numerous geochemical and biological
              measurements and provide the ship time.  The collaboration will advance
              understanding of OMZ ecology and organic matter preservations. OMZs provide in
              situ laboratories of past climate conditions and as such, can enhance abilities
              to predict the impacts of global climate change on continental margins.

              
These award covers travel funds and living expenses for the US investigators
              aboard the ocean research vessel and travel to the UK  for laboratory analyses.
