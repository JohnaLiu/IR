Abstract    :
              This project will provide partial support for the Conference on Quantum Phases
              at the Nanoscale (NANOPHASE) which will take place in Erice, Sicily, Italy,
              July 15-20, 2002.  The Conference will consider recent advances in the study
              and applications of novel states in systems of nanoscale dimensions.  Main
              goals are to bring together scientists that are playing key roles in this
              research field, along with young researchers, in order to evaluate recent
              developments, and to create visions that will guide future interdisciplinary
              research in nanoscale science and technology.  The Conference will include
              approximately 30 plenary lectures and 100 participants.  The core funding for
              this project is from the European Community.  US support is provided by the
              Office of Naval Research and the National Science Foundation.  The NSF support
              will provide travel expenses for young US scientists to attend the Conference,
              and later to visit selected European laboratories to explore and develop
              international collaborations in the area of nanoscience.  The project is
              supported by the Western Europe Program of the NSF Office of International
              Science and Engineering.
