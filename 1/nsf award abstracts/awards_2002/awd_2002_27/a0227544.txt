Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a three-year continuing award to the Johns
              Hopkins University (JHU), Center for Integrated Surgical Systems and Technology
              (CISST) for the support of a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site
              Program entitled, "A Site RET that Teams Math, Science and Technology Education
              Teachers from Under Resourced Urban High Schools to Create Multi-disciplinary
              PBL Demonstrations (TEAMRET)."  This site will involve a total of 15 teachers
              per year for 3 years at CISST core institutions-Johns Hopkins, Carnegie Mellon
              and MIT. The teachers will be selected from Baltimore, Pittsburgh, and Boston
              urban high schools and will participate in a unique set of research and
              workshop activities at JHU.
