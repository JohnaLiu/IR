Abstract    :
              The El Paso Math and Science Partnership (El Paso MSP) includes the three urban
              school districts that encompass El Paso, nine rural school districts in El Paso
              and Hudspeth counties, the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), El Paso
              Community College, the Region 19 Education Service Center, and El Paso area
              civic, business and community organizations and leaders.  

The El Paso MSP
              is aimed at improving student achievement in mathematics and science among all
              students, at all preK-12 levels, and at reducing the achievement gap among
              groups of students.  The goals of the partnership include:

fully engaging
              university and community college leadership and mathematics, science,
              engineering and education faculty in working toward significantly improved K-12
              math/science student achievement;

ensuring the number, quality and diversity
              of K-12 teachers of mathematics and science across partner schools,
              particularly schools with the greatest needs;

building the capacity of area
              districts and schools to provide the highest quality curriculum, instruction
              and assessment, and to ensure the highest level achievement in mathematics and
              science for every student;

ensuring the K-16 alignment of mathematics and
              science curriculum, instruction and assessment, to ensure  that students
              graduating from area high schools are prepared to enroll and be successful in
              mathematics, science and engineering courses at UTEP and El Paso Community
              College; and

prioritizing research on educational reform and preK-16
              partnerships.
