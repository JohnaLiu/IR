Abstract    :
              SHINE (Solar Heliospheric and INterplanetary Environment) is an affiliation of
              researchers within the solar, interplanetary, and heliospheric communities
              dedicated to promoting an enhanced understanding of the processes by which
              energy in the form of magnetic fields and particles are produced by the Sun
              and/or accelerated in interplanetary space, and on the mechanisms by which
              these fields and particles are transported to Earth through the inner
              heliosphere.  A focal point for the SHINE research activities and targeted
              campaigns is the annual four-day SHINE workshop.  This grant provides financial
              support for the participation of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and a
              few select international scientists.  It also defrays minimal costs associated
              with the management and organization of the next three workshops.  For more
