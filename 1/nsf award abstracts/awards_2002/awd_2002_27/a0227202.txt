Abstract    :
              Through FOCUS (Faculty Outreach Collaborations Uniting Scientists, Students and
              Schools), the University of California, Irvine (UCI) unites the efforts of
              mathematics, science, education and research library faculty and staff with
              educators from local community colleges, school districts and local educational
              support agencies.  The partnership builds on prior established relationships
              between UCI and three high-need California school districts: Compton Unified,
              Santa Ana Unified and the Westside of Newport-Mesa Unified.  These schools
              serve 106,695 students of whom 82% are Hispanic and 11% are African American. 
              

The work of FOCUS will include the construction of a "future teacher
              highway" to increase the number, quality and diversity of preK-12 teachers of
              mathematics and science; involvement of math and science professionals in
              "Discipline Dialogues" that cross segmental boundaries, and the creation of
              systemic reform in the professional development of preK-12 teachers of
              mathematics and science.  FOCUS will ultimately impact the number of new
              mathematics and science teachers; the number of high school students prepared
              for and enrolled in advanced mathematics and science coursework; the
              achievement gap between the general student population and English Language
              Learners; and the number of higher education faculty engaged in efforts with
              preK-12 educational systems.
