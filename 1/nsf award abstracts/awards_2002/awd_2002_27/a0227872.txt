Abstract    :
              Dr. Sara Wadia-Fascetti is an Associate Professor of Civil Engineering at
              Northeastern University, and has served as a mentor to undergraduate and
              graduate female and male engineering students since 1994.  She developed the
              e-mentoring program to give students a mechanism for communication with their
              mentors and mentees between meetings.  The program links female pre-college
              students, college students, and professionals in discussion groups with two to
              five additional women.  Professional women are recruited from the college of
              Engineering alumni as well as local companies.

Dr. Wadia-Fascetti has also
              created a program, Connections, that offers weekly after-school activities for
              Boston girls, including a computer clubhouse for middle- and high-school girls
              to work alongside college women, an "introduction to college" series for female
              high-school students so they learn how the higher education system works, and a
              number of other programs for college women.
