Andrews, Polly
 
Ms. Polly Andrews is awarded funds at the Denver
              Museum of Nature and Science to develop an Internship Program for the new Space
              Odyssey exhibit. The funds will, for one year, support one full-time resident
              teacher intern, the equivalent of one half FTE  research scientist (allocated
              over two part-time content specific researchers), two part-time graduate
              students, and four part-time undergraduate students from different disciplines.
               These interns will work with Museum staff to develop and prototype educational
              programs for Space Odyssey. 

The scientists, teacher, students, and Museum
              staff will work together in teams to create or upgrade classes that cover
              topics in solar system astronomy, stellar astronomy, and astrobiology.  In
              addition, a separate new program will be developed that highlights the latest
              developments in astronomy and space science in a news format. The scientists
              will ensure that the scientific content for the classes will  provide a
              balanced and cutting-edge view of contemporary space science research.  The
              teacher will ensure that the content presented in the classes is both age- and
              curriculum- appropriate, and that the programs meet teachers' needs. The
              students will gain valuable experience by serving as research and program
              assistants. Space Odyssey has the potential  to reach 1.5 million annual Museum
              visitors.   

This project is supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary
              Actitivies in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
