Abstract    :
              Dr. Fiona Goodchild is a cognitive psychologist who is the Education Director of
              the NSF Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at the University of California at
              Santa Barbara. She focuses on a variety of mentoring, research and peer
              networking activities that impact K-12, undergraduate and graduate students.
              Dr. Goodchild has created an educational process that replicates itself and
              adapts and continues to "grow" new scientists.  There is ample evidence that
              using an advance research laboratory environment to do this kind of education
              and outreach takes a very creative and talented individual, which has been a
              hallmark of Dr. Goodchild's effort.
