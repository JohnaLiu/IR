Abstract    :
              The Cleveland Math and Science Partnership includes the Cleveland Municipal
              School District, John Carroll University, Case Western Reserve University,
              Cleveland State University and the Education Development Center.  The Cleveland
              Municipal School District is the largest school system in Ohio, enrolling over
              74,000 preK to 12th grade students of whom 71% are African American and 8% are
              Hispanic.  The Cleveland Math and Science Partnership focuses on the
              mathematics and science teachers of over 15,000 secondary school students as
              the majority of these teachers in the District are not properly qualified and
              do not have the certification to effectively teach these subjects.

The
              partnership aims to improve student achievement in the Cleveland Municipal
              School District by equipping its teachers with additional skills acquired
              through university continuing education programs.  The universities will
              establish three diverse graduate programs for Cleveland middle and high school
              mathematics and science teachers (grades 6-12): John Carroll University will
              establish a master's degree program with a specialization in mathematics or
              science for middle school teachers; Cleveland State University will offer
              graduate-level content courses that may be counted towards state licensure for
              middle school teachers; and Case Western Reserve University will offer graduate
              courses focusing on applied science laboratory and mathematics demonstration
              preparation for high school teachers.  The university partners will work
              together on a regular basis to custom-design and refine their courses to align
              with the District's needs.  The District and university partners will also join
              with the Education Development Center (a) to train master teachers to become
              instructional leaders and mentors within the District's schools and (b) to
              develop a mentoring program for middle school teachers new to teaching
              mathematics and science.
