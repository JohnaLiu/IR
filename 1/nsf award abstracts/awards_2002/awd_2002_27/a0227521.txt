Abstract    :
              The PRIME: Promoting Reflective Inquiry in Mathematics Education partnership
              includes Black Hills State University, Technology and Innovations in Education
              (TIE) of the Black Hills Special Services Cooperative, and the Rapid City
              School District aimed at improving achievement in mathematics for all students
              in Rapid City Schools with a particular goal of reducing the achievement gap
              between Native American and non-Native American students.  The project seeks to
              improve the professional capacity and sustain the quality of preK-12 inservice
              teachers of mathematics in Rapid City School District and student teachers of
              mathematics from Black Hills State University in order to provide effective,
              inquiry-based mathematics instruction.  Objectives include reducing the number
              of high school students taking non-college preparatory mathematics, increasing
              the number of students taking upper level mathematics, and increasing student
              performance on college entrance exams.  The project provides 100 hours of
              professional development in a combination of content-based workshops at the
              district level and building-based activities involving modeling of effective
              lessons, peer mentoring, and coaching, and lesson study.   Mathematics
              education and discipline faculty from Black Hills State University are involved
              with district-wide professional development activities. A cadre of
              building-based Mathematics Lead Teachers convene building based learning teams
              comprised of mathematics teachers, mathematics student teachers from Black
              Hills State University, school counselors, and building administrators to
              identify key issues in mathematics curriculum and instruction.
