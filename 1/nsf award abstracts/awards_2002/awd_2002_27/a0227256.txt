Abstract    :
              The SUPER (School-University Partnership for Excellence in Research-based) STEM
              Project is a partnership between the Baltimore County Public Schools (BCPS) and
              the University of Maryland Baltimore County.  SUPER STEM activities are built
              on a foundation of past work between the district and the university.  The
              project focuses on increasing student achievement, especially that of
              low-performing students, and targets low-performing schools. Located in the
              suburban region around Baltimore, BCPS enrolled 107,322 students during the
              2001-02 academic year.  The County population is rapidly shifting in
              ethno-racial characteristics such that the most recent census indicates that
              White residents in the county have decreased from 84.9% in 1990 to 74.4% in
              2000.  Within BCPS, 33.7% of the students are African American, 59.7% are
              White, 4.0% are Asian American, and 2.0% are Hispanic. 

To achieve its
              MSP-aligned goals, SUPER STEM will:
1.  Establish Visiting STEM Scholarships
              to attract talented scientists and educators to accelerate the development and
              teaching of new curricula;
2.  Provide weekend and summer accelerated academic
              coursework for the lowest-performing students and schools;
3.  Create STEM
              Academies in the lowest-performing schools;
4.  Expand the UMBC Urban
              Education Principal, Teacher and Intern Scholarships to recruit and retain the
              most talented STEM educators to lowest-performing schools;
5.  Provide over
              100 hours of STEM training to roughly 1800 teachers; and
6.  Conduct ongoing,
              hierarchical, multi-method longitudinal student and teacher achievement
              analyses, performance assessments, and work sampling.
