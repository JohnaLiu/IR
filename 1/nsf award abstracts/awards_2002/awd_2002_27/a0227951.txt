Abstract    :
              Dr. Martha Mecartney is an Associate Professor at the University of California -
              Irvine. Dr. Mecartney has created outreach programs for K-12 students and
              developed summer programs for middle school teachers from low-income
              communities. She has had extensive involvement in the UC Irvine California
              Alliance for Minority Participation, and was the founder of the Alliance for
              Graduate Education Program (a nine-campus consortium) and the UC Irvine
              Fastrack to the Professoriate.  Both of these were designed to advance
              minorities and women into graduate level engineering. 

Dr. Mecartney is
              commended for her effort that has led to the mobility of minorities and women
              into the professoriate and the engineering profession, especially through her
              attention to the interests and needs of undergraduate women. The sheer volume
              of programs and services that Dr. Mecartney has led exemplifies her creative
              academic leadership and insightful programming that listens to and is
              instructed by the voices of minorities and women.
