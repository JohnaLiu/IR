Abstract    :
              Dr. David Bynum has been actively involved with enlarging programs of excellence
              and success for underrepresented students since 1993. Through his efforts, he
              has helped to change the campus environment. He has done a lot for the
              community and the institution; working with students at all levels of the
              ladder. His programs have become institutionalized, and have reached almost 200
              community college students. He has received grants from the Howard Hughes
              Medical Institute, NIH and has created the Long Island Group Advancing Science
              Education, an umbrella group that has received local, state and national
              attention and awards.
