Hemenway, Mary Kay

Funds are awarded to Dr. Mary Kay Hemenway at
              the University of Texas at Austin to produce a web site and museum kiosk that
              will describe and explain how astronomers perform astronomical research. 
              Specifically, the project will help adults understand how astronomers perform
              research at a major astronomical observatory; help students explore
              astronomical research, equipment, and careers; lead both a Science Education
              graduate student, a teacher intern, and other K-12 teachers to a deeper
              understanding of astronomical research while enhancing their contacts with
              astronomers; and give astronomers an organized way to share their research with
              the general public. 

The web site and kiosk will open with a calendar
              outlining research scheduled on each of 
the major research telescopes at
              McDonald Observatory.  Links to related visitor-friendly 
pages provide
              information on the astronomers using the telescopes; information on the
              telescopes, including their instrumentation and operation; rationale for using
              the chosen instrument for each particular project; and a glossary of astronomy
              terms.  The primary audience will be the 1,500 teachers and their 150,000
              students using "StarDate/Universo in the Classroom." The project team includes
              experts in astronomy public outreach and education, an astronomical research
              expert, a graduate student in Science Education, and a K-12  teacher.  

The
              team will also share the project's design and templates with other institutions
              with similar outreach missions.  A national Education Advisory Board will
              evaluate the project as it develops.  Planned evaluation techniques include
              interviewing Observatory visitors who use the kiosk, and surveying teachers
              about their and their students use of the web site. 

This project is
              supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary Actitivies in the Directorate for
              Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
