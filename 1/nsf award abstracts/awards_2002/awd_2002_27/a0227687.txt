Abstract    :
              This international collaborative research project will bring together
              researchers from the United States and Bulgaria.  The principal investigators
              are Dr. Samuel Mukasa from the University of Michigan and Dr. Ivan Haydoutov
              from the Geological Institute of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.  They
              propose to establish timing constraints on pre-Alpine history of the
              Balkans.

This is a 12 month study to date the crystalization, metamorphic
              and cooling ages of ophiolitic and metamorphic rocks from the Rhodope and
              Srednegorie regions of the Balkan Peninsula, with the goal of reconstructing
              the pre-Alpine evolution of this region and the tectonic ties from pre-Alpine
              Europe through to Turkey and regions farther south and east.  The Balkan region
              currently represents a major hole in our ability to reconstruct pre-late
              Cretaceous tectonic terranes along the northern and southern margins of the
              Tethys ocean, with major uncertainties about correlating events and terranes
              between Austria/former Yugoslavia and Turkey.  This project is an excellent
              opportunity to begin to compile the data that will be needed to unravel the
              older tectonic history of the Balkan region and to connect the tectonic
              terranes and deformational events from western to eastern Tethys.

This
              project in earth sciences research fulfills the program objectives of bringing
              together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine
              complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and
              competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
