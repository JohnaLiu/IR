This UMEB award will provide financial support and
              mentoring for up to fifteen undergraduate students per year from groups
              traditionally underrepresented in science to attend national meetings in the
              area of mathematical biology, with a focus on environmental mathematical
              biology. In the first year the students will all be drawn for Cornell
              University's Mathematical and Theoretical Biology Institute, a summer research
              experience with a very strong record of enabling minority undergraduates to
              pursue careers in mathematical biology. In later years, students not enrolled
              in MBTI will also be recruited and brought into the meeting activities and
              mentoring opportunities provided by this award. The PI has received
              endorsements and promised assistance from several professional societies,
              including the Society for Mathematical Biology, the Society for Industrial and
              Applied Mathematics.

This project build on efforts undertaken by MBTI and
              others to bring a broader range of students into mathematical biology. It will
              help foster the professional growth of minority students, provide a solid
              mentoring network for students to participate fully in the conferences, draw
              more underrepresented minorities into areas where mathematical biology and
              environmental biology overlap, and more actively engage several professional
              societies in ongoing efforts to broaden participation.  This program is an
              important step towards meeting a national need of developing a more
              quantitatively- prepared scientific workforce and to draw upon the full range
              of intellectual talent from diverse populations.
