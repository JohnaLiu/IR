Digital Government: The Virtual
              Citizen:  Identity, Autonomy, and Accountability

This proposal will apply
              Camp's unusual multidisciplinary expertise (Engineering and Public Policy
              Ph.D.) in the area of trust, an area with both technical and social
              implications.  She will use this small grant to develop government
              relationships relevant to preparation of a workshop in this area and to place
              the issue of "trust" within a government context.
