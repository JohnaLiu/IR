The 2002 International
              Conference On Multimedia & Expo (ICME) is the third IEEE multimedia conference
              to take place in joint collaboration with four IEEE societies: the Circuits and
              Systems Society, the Computer Society, the Signal Processing Society, and the
              Communications Society. This year, the conference will take place in Lausanne,
              Switzerland, from August 26 to August 29.  ICME serves as a forum for the
              dissemination of state-of-the-art IEEE as well as non-IEEE research,
              development, and implementations of multimedia systems, technologies and
              applications. It brings together researchers, developers and practitioners
              from
academia and industry working in all areas in multimedia. It is arguably
              the most inter-disciplinary of all IEEE conferences. Furthermore, it provides
              industry an opportunity to showcase products. Typical topics covered by ICME
              include signal processing for media integration, components and technologies
              for multimedia systems, human-machine interface and interaction, multimedia
              databases and file systems, multimedia
communication and networking, system
              integration, applications, standards (e.g., MPEG) and related issues.
