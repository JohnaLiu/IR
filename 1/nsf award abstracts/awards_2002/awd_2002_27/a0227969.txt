Abstract    :
              This proposal for a joint EU-US workshop will bring together the active
              researchers from the US and European Union who are investigating information
              and communication technologies in the home.  This workshop is important as
              scientists in a number of countries are studying technology in the home, but
              because of publication lag times are not aware of each other's results. This
              workshop will serve as a forum to address the role of technology in 1)
              household behavior, including socialization, time use, and gender differences,
              2) social interaction, including the impact of the Internet on social capital
              and quality of relationships, 3) employment and new forms of work, and 4)
              country differences  in the use and impact of technology in the home. One
              important output will be an academic book documenting the current state of the
              theoretical and empirical research.
