ABSTRACT

Proposal No.:			0227325
Proposal Title: 		Vertically
              Integrated Partnerships K-16
Principal Investigator: 	Nancy Shapiro
Lead
              Institution: 		University System of Maryland
The University System of Maryland
              (USM) in partnership with the Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) will
              develop a sustainable K-16 professional development model for high school
              science teachers, prospective pre-service science teaching candidates, and
              college faculty.  The project, "Vertically Integrated Partnerships K-16" (VIP
              K-16) has two major aims (a) To enrich science teacher knowledge in order to
              improve high school science instruction to better enable students to meet
              rigorous state science standards as measured on the Maryland Science High
              School Assessments, and (b) To improve the teaching skills of college science
              faculty in order to improve the quality of undergraduate general education
              science courses.
USM institutions that will participate as core partners, with
              commitments to institutional change, include the University of Maryland College
              Park, the University of Maryland Baltimore County, and Towson University. 
              Montgomery College and the Montgomery County Public Schools complete the core
              member partners of VIP K-16.  The University of Maryland Biotechnology
              Institute, the University of Maryland Universities at Shady Grove, the
              University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, and the University
              System of Maryland are service provider partners. Through summer institutes and
              school-year collaborative sessions, small professional learning
              communities-vertically integrated partnerships (VIPs) consisting of teachers,
              STEM disciplinary faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate interns and
              pre-service science teachers-will collegially learn about and develop best
              instructional practices and instructional materials linked to high school
              assessments.  Phasing in biology, earth/space science, and physics/chemistry
              over a three-year period, VIP K-16 will involve 350 science teachers serving
              approximately 37,000 high school students, and substantively involving
              36-university faculty.
The VIP K-16 will bring together high school science
              teachers with their peers from Montgomery College and the USM institutions to
              form the "Maryland Science Faculty," charged with collaboratively rethinking
              and redesigning how science is learned, both in high school and in college.  To
              that end, the Partnership commits to five key goals: (1) Improve student
              learning outcomes, as measured by high school assessments; (2) Improve teacher
              content knowledge in the sciences by providing high quality professional
              development to inservice high school teachers; (3) Improve college faculty
              teaching skills by providing them with expert mentor/master teacher during
              summer institutes; (4) Enhance graduate student teaching skills by exposing
              them to expert mentor/master teachers during summer workshops, and having them
              complete teaching portfolios; and (5) Increase the number of undergraduate
              science students who choose teaching as a career
