As the size,the cost and the power
              consumption of communication devices and integrated circuits de-
creases
              designing a system of autonomous sensors,that can monitor the environment and
              are capable
of transporting and processing the information in any point of the
              controlled area,becomes a concrete
goal.While the fabrication technology is
              mature to make intelligent sensors with wireless communication
interfaces
              which are small and inexpensive,the main challenge in the design of these
              networks is at the
system level.  The scenario analyzed in [4 ]is radically di
              .erent from large networks such as the
telephone network that have highly
              hierarchical architectures:in [4 ]all the nodes have identical
              function-
alities,equal transmission bandwidth and are uniformly distributed
              over a circular region of .xed radius.

However,[4 ]is neglecting one
              fundamental aspect of the problem:the nodes samples will be increas-
ingly
              dependent as the density of the nodes increases [7 ].This observation was used
              in [8 ]where it was
proven that distributed codes,that compress separately the
              correlated samples in each node,can reduce
the amount of bits per node per
              square meter to an O (N .1 ),i.e.much faster than the transport capacity.
The
              limitation of the approach in [8 ]is the high complexity required to have signi
              .cant compression gain
without sharing one single bit of data among the nodes
              Fortunately,there is no need to impose such
constraint.After all,the trademark
              of multi-hop networks is that power e .cient transmission is achieved
when the
              data travel through several intermediate close-by nodes before reaching their
              .nal destination.
If neighboring nodes were jointly compressing the data
              before forwarding them remotely,they could save
many bits per sample while
              transmitting with the same or even greater precision.A good engineering
design
              is compelled to exploit this fortunate coincidence by combining routing and and
              classical (not dis-
tributed)source coding.This is the truly novel aspect of
              our project and,to the best of our knowledge,
this connection has not been
              studied before.
