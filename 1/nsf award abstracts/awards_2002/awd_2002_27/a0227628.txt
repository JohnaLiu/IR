Abstract    :
              Prediction of tropical cyclone intensity change remains a very difficult
              problem.  One reason is that the dynamic and thermodynamic processes associated
              with tropical cyclones are not well understood.  The PI plans to use
              flight-level and Global Position Satellite (GPS) dropsonde data collected from
              reconnaissance flight missions, as well as satellite and radar retrieved data,
              to 1) study the inner-core structure and dynamics with emphasis on forces
              driving hurricane inner-core convection and its feedback to the hurricane
              vortex; 2) investigate the variability of the tropical cyclone boundary layer
              kinematic and thermodynamic structure; and 3) improve methods of predicting
              short-term tropical cyclone intensity based on the tangential wind profile
              using observational data. 

The planned research has the potential of
              providing new knowledge on tropical cyclone structure and intensity change, as
              well as generating a new conceptual model for intensity prediction.
