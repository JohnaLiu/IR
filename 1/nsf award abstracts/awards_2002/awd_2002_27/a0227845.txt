TITLE: Student
              Travel to the AAAI Robot Competition and Exhibition

This award provides
              support for fifteen students, with special efforts made to incorporate women
              and underrepresented minorities, to attend and participate in the AAAI Robot
              Competition and Exhibition at the National Conference on Artificial
              Intelligence (AAAI-2002) in Edmonton, Alberta.  This event brings together
              robotics researchers from colleges, universities and research laboratories to
              compete and to demonstrate cutting edge, state of the art research in this
              area.  Students attending benefit from observing demonstrations of the
              research, networking with students from other institutions with similar
              interests, presenting and discussing their own research, and through a
              significant mentoring program.  Every supported student will be expected to
              write a one or two page report on her or his experiences at the competition and
              exhibition.  These reports will be used in evaluating the success of the funded
              student participation in the event.
