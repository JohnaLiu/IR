This award is to the University of Southern Mississippi to
              support the activity described below for 36 months.  The proposal was submitted
              in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF
              02060). The partners include the University of Southern Mississippi (Lead
              Institution), Mississippi Technology Alliance, Hattiesburg Area Development
              Partnership, the Society of Mississippi Inventors, and the Mississippi Polymer
              Institute. The proposed goals are to bolster competitiveness and innovation in
              Mississippi companies by establishing infrastructure for participating in high
              throughput screening techniques (HTS) and combinatorial methodologies (CM), and
              to establish a laboratory for HTS/CM experimentation and a support organization
              drawn from the University, companies and private/state economic development
              authorities. A high throughput laboratory for screening of formulations and
              providing an understanding of its impact on the development of new products to
              companies is being established.  This laboratory provides new HTS methods and
              equipment for the technology companies and individual inventors in Mississippi.
              

Currently there are 100 companies in Mississippi involved in producing
              polymeric formulations, representing approximately 6,000 employees.  There are
              an additional 10,000 employees in other related polymer products manufacturing
              fields.  The effort will make these companies more productive and shorten the
              development time to market for new products and polymer formulations. The
              University of Southern Mississippi has several active programs to recruit and
              retain minority students, e.g., Alliance for Graduate Education in Mississippi,
              the Mississippi Alliance for Minority Participation, Increasing Minority Access
              to Graduate Education.  Minority students will be involved in this effort.  The
              creation of more jobs combined with the training of workforce for the polymer
              industry have obvious societal benefits.
