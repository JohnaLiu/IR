Abstract    :
              The Shannon Point Marine Center of Western Washington University is a resident
              center for the study of marine sciences.  Students reside at the center for
              five and a half months while they are preparing for graduate studies in
              oceanography. The Center's approach to minority student development is
              comprehensive, and includes intensive mentoring, simultaneous coursework
              integrated with research, interactive student relationships, and immediate
              access to research facilities and senior faculty. The extensive laboratory
              resources are enhanced by the surrounding context of diverse field environments
              on site or within the immediate vicinity.  

The Center has accomplished an
              exemplary record of minority student recruitment, retention and degree
              completion. The intensity and positive value of mentoring and the nature of its
              impact on minority student persistence and achievement is reflected in the
              letters from participants regarding this program and by the impressive number
              of minority students actually entering graduate school.
