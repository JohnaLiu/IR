Abstract    :
              The project is proposed by a partnership that includes Washington University,
              St. Louis, five near-urban school districts in St. Louis (Ferguson-Florissant,
              Maplewood-Richmond Heights, Riverview Gardens, University City and Webster
              Groves) and two informal science centers, the St. Louis Science Center and the
              St. Louis Zoo.   

The partnership effort is to improve the mathematics and
              science achievement of preK-12 students beginning with a particular focus on
              grades 4-8.  The school districts are responsible for the education of
              approximately 29,000 students and the project will impact several hundred
              teachers each year. 

A goal is to enhance student achievement, and this is
              accomplished by:  improving capacity to provide a challenging math and science
              curriculum for every student; developing exemplary teacher support from
              pre-service education through the induction years; improving teacher quality,
              quantity and diversity using innovative recruitment strategies, and; narrowing
              the achievement gap between under-represented minority students and Caucasians
              in math and science.  
To achieve these goals, the partnership is designing
              and implementing a six-part infrastructure for teacher professional development
              and a materials management and community support system, which is to be
              sustained for the long-term.
