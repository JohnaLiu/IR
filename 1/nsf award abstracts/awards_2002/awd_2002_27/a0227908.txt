Abstract    :
              This MPS-IPSE award supports Cosmic Connections, a partnership between the
              Milton J. Rubenstein Museum of Science and Technology (MOST) and a group of
              research scientists at Syracuse University.  A series of four to six museum
              exhibits introducing concepts from cosmology to the general public will be
              developed and constructed.  The individual exhibit modules will ultimately be
              integrated into a single permanent exhibit at MOST.  Graduate students,
              undergraduate students, and schoolteachers will serve as interns in the
              project, playing crucial roles in the design process.  Some student
              participants will have a background in physics, while others will bring
              strength in visual design.  Working in concert, these groups will assure that
              the exhibits produced offer both technical accuracy and visual
              effectiveness.

The overall aim of the project is to bring to the general
              public a broader awareness of science, its methods, and its most exciting
              results.  By working closely with various community organizations, Cosmic
              Connections will seek to reach out to a broad and diverse audience.  This
              project is funded by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS.
