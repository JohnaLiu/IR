This is a request for support for a conference that will
              focus on designing research objectives for the geology and geochemistry of ore
              deposits (economic geology) in the future.  The conference will be held October
              5, 2002, in Denver, Colorado, one day before the national Geological Society
              Conference meeting.  The main goal of this conference is to outline research
              that will help clarify how mineral deposits and related geochemical anomalies
              form and how they are related to the global-scale processes that have produced
              chemical heterogeneity in our planet.  Support will be used largely to
              supplement lodging costs for those already attending the GSA meeting.  Results
              of the conference will be published in the Newsletter of the Society of
              Economic Geologists and other journals.
