Abstract    :
              The project will investigate aspects of unbalanced dynamics relevant to the
              tropical and extratropical atmosphere.  Unbalanced motions, by definition,
              result when the balance between major geophysical forces (e.g., the
              pressure-gradient and Coriolis forces) is perturbed.  The adjustment, or
              reestablishment of equilibrium, is accompanied by transient motions and/or wave
              propagation, such as gravity waves, inertial instability, etc.  Dr. Dunkerton
              (Northwest Research Associates, Bellevue, Washington) will extend the analysis
              of inertial adjustment (resulting in zero potential vorticity in the adjusted
              region) from axisymmetric 2D flow configurations to non-symmetric 3D flows
              perturbed by Rossby waves in the winter hemisphere.  Dr. Dunkerton will also
              investigate the triggering of deep moist tropical convection by gravity waves
              and other transient motions that are excited in the balance-restoring
              processes.  The role of SST gradients and curvature in forcing the tropical
              Hadley circulation will also be analyzed.  The project will advance our
              understanding of fundamental dynamical processes operative in atmosphere, and
              contribute to improved modeling of dynamical interactions between the
              hemispheres, triggering of deep convection, and ocean-atmosphere coupling (via
              the Hadley circulation).
