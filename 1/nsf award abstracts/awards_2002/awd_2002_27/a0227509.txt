Abstract    :
              The award provides funds to develop a prototype mini acoustically tracked
              drogue. The drogue is being developed in response to the need to understand the
              patterns and mechanisms of larval transport, identified as a priority by the
              Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) workshop
              participants in January 02. 

The PI has looked at currently available
              drogues and has determined that they are not suitable because of their size and
              limited ability to supply positional information while submerged. The PI plans
              to research, design, fabricate, and test the prototype mini-drogue. If
              successful, the proposed instrument would provide insights into aspects of the
              nearshore circulation such as sub-surface parcel trajectories connecting
              offshore coastal circulation features to shallow water habitats near shore and
              will significantly advance our understanding of how coastal circulation
              processes deliver larvae to coastal ecosystems.
