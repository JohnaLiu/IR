Abstract    :
              The University of Georgia and the University of Michigan are leading the
              development of a Center to implement a potentially powerful professional
              development model for pre-K-16 mathematics education.  The Center will
              establish a research agenda to examine the nature of the mathematical knowledge
              that is important to teachers' proficiency in teaching mathematics, and will
              use the knowledge gained to strengthen both the pre-service education and the
              in-service professional development of teachers . The Center will combine
              practice, research and professional development to build resources and capacity
              for the preparation of teachers of mathematics.  The other higher education
              partners are the University of Michigan-Dearborn and Henry Ford Community
              College.  School district partners in Georgia are Gwinnett County Public
              Schools, Morgan County Public Schools and Social Circle city Schools; and in
              Michigan, the large Washtenaw Intermediate School District.  Connections are
              also established with a number of professional mathematics organizations,
              including the American Mathematical Society and the National Council of
              Teachers of Mathematics, to enable the Center to collaborate with and support
              collegiate teachers of mathematics and teacher educators on a broad scale
              across diverse settings.
