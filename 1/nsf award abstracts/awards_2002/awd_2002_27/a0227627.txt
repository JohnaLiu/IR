Abstract    :
              The Exploratorium will host an invitational three-day conference on best
              practices in science exhibition development.  At the conference practitioners
              will identify best practices in conceiving, designing, managing and developing
              science exhibitions.  The conference will highlight current issues such as
              responding to diversity, providing access to current science and balancing the
              considerations of market and mission.  The ideas and issues raised at this
              conference will culminate in a publication for dissemination to the field that
              includes conference proceedings as well as interviews with and essays by
              practicing exhibition professionals
