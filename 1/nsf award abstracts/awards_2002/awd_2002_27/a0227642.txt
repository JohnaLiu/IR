This is a three-year project submitted by Dr. Mark Harmon,
              Oregon State University, in collaboration with Dr. Hen-Biau King, Taiwan
              Forestry Research Institute, to conduct a comparative study on decomposition of
              15N-labeled fine roots and fate of N releases in Western Oregon, USA and Taiwan
              LTER sites.  Root decomposition is a fundamental process in forest ecosystems. 
              Understanding of fine root decomposition and its N dynamics is important in
              understanding controls over soil strength maintenance, soil organic matter
              formation, ecosystem N cycling, and ecosystem responses to disturbance and
              climate changes. This cross-site comparison project between the U.S. and Taiwan
              can contribute significantly to International Long-Term Ecological Cooperation,
              and provide a valuable research experience for U.S. students.  This project is
              jointly supported by the National Science Council of Taiwan and NSF.
