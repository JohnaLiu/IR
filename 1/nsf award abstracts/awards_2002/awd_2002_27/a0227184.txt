Abstract    :
              The Virtual Mentoring for Student Success (VMSS) is a partnership that includes
              the National Science Teachers Association; six urban schools districts in
              California - the Hayward Unified, the Morgan Hill Unified, the Mount Diablo
              Unified, the Gilroy Unified, the North Monterey County, and the Pajaro Valley
              Unified School Districts; ninety small rural school districts in Montana - the
              Billings Public Schools, Great Falls Public Schools and Manhattan Public
              Schools, the Alliance for Curriculum Enhancement, MT Small Schools Alliance,
              Golden Triangle Consortium, Prairie View Consortium, Missoula County Consortium
              and Northwest Curriculum Consortium; University of California Santa Cruz and
              Montana State University-Bozeman.   

The partnership focuses on raising
              student achievement in science at the middle and high school levels through
              effective sustained professional development of novice teachers using an
              innovative, disciplinary, content-specific distance-delivery model that
              promises to reduce teacher attrition rates.   Strategies include: co-mentoring
              networks of new teachers, mentors, and current and future faculty; preparing a
              cadre of administrators to support beginning teachers and their mentors to
              improve student learning; and meeting a national need by developing national
              standards to guide the effective mentoring and induction of novice science
              teachers. The project is impacting 800 novice teachers, 480 mentors, 720
              administrators and 10 science faculty.
