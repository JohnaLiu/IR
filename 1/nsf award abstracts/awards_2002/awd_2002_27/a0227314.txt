Abstract    :
              The diversity of model systems presents both challenges and opportunities for
              applying comparative and phylogenetic approaches to questions in plant
              functional genomics.  New methodologies are needed in order to describe
              features of biological sequences and maps across multiple organisms that are
              related by a known phylogeny, as opposed to making either simple pair-wise
              comparisons or 'flat' comparisons among multiple organisms that ignore the
              presence of phylogenetic structure.  This research focuses on two test
              applications of phylogenomics: (1) identifying conserved motifs and residues
              that define particular lineages within a gene family and (2) reconstructing
              genome rearrangement events along a phylogeny in such a way as to be able to
              predict gene content and order in sparsely sampled genomes.  Because some of
              the methodology proposed is computationally intensive and requires the
              integration of data from a variety of public sources, this work is complemented
              by the development of an online plant phylogenomics database called Phytome. 
              In collaboration with the Partnership for Minority Advancement in the
              Biosciences, an inquiry-based K-12 educational module is developed and
              delivered to targeted public schools in North Carolina through a mobile science
              teaching laboratory.
