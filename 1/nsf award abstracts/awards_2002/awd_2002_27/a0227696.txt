This UMEB award will provide financial support and
              professional assistance for 10 or more undergraduate students, from groups
              traditionally underrepresented in science, to attend the annual conference of
              the Botanical Society of America (BSA) from 2002 through 2006.  A mentoring
              network of undergraduates, graduates and faculty will provide support for
              career development and will foster socialization of students.  Mentors will
              help integrate students into conference activities through a series of pre-,
              during-, and post-meeting activities.  At the conference, mentors will show
              students around the meeting site, introduce them to professionals, and
              accompany them to scientific sessions, field trips, workshops, and other
              events.  Multiple assessments will be conducted to determine if program
              goals/objectives are being achieved.  A robust plan for recruiting students and
              mentors will be employed, and it will canvass the entire BSA membership, as
              well as take advantage of existing professional networks of BSA members and
              other external professional societies and consortia.  

This project
              represents a significant step by the BSA to attract and retain minority
              undergraduates to plant biology.  It will help foster the professional growth
              of minority students, provide a solid mentoring network for students to
              participate fully in the conferences, and draw more underrepresented minorities
              into environmental biology disciplines.  This program is an important step
              towards meeting a national need to strengthen the scientific workforce and to
              draw upon the full range of intellectual talent from diverse ethnic and
              minority populations.
