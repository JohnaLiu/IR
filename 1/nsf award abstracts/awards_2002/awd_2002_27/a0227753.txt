Dr. Pilachowski is
              awarded funds to support a meeting of Site Directors of REU programs in
              Astronomy, to be held on the campus of Indiana University in Bloomington,
              Indiana. The purpose of the meeting is to bring together the Site Directors of
              the various REU Site Programs in Astronomy to share experiences and to discuss
              issues of relevance to all programs, with the hope of improving what are
              already outstanding programs for undergraduate students in astronomy, physics,
              mathematics, and related sciences.
