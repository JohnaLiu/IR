Abstract    :
              The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is hosting a workshop on June 5 - 6,
              2002 to promote the formation of research partnerships between researchers in
              designated EPSCoR states and the scientific staff from the Department of Energy
              (DoE) laboratories and facilties.  The workshop is sponsored by the DoE Office
              of EPSCoR program and is co-sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF)
              EPSCoR program.  

The primary objective of the workshop is to provide a
              forum for researchers from the EPSCoR states to: 1) report advances in
              EPSCoR-funded research activities, 2) update their knowledge of Department of
              Energy  and NSF programs and activities, 3) learn about the Pacific Northwest
              National Laboratory user facilities and research directions, 4) explore
              opportunities for research with Department of Energy scientists, 5) develop
              plans for future research projects and 6) learn about DoE laboratory
              opportunities for training and hands-on research experience for undergraduate,
              graduate, postdoctoral fellows and new faculty.
