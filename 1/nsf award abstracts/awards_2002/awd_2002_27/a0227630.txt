Abstract    :
              The Strengthening the Understanding of Mathematics and Sciences (SUMS) Institute
              at Arizona State University administers the Math Science Honors Program (MSHP)
              throughout the state as well as other similar programs. MSHP is a residential
              summer program that enrolls students in a college-level mathematics or science
              course. SUMS also provides support to its students who enter college and pursue
              graduate study. Undergraduates receive mentoring, tutoring, and scholarships or
              student employment.  They also provide support to the pre-college
              program.

The program is designed to provide a successful university
              experience for students from underrepresented groups and to enhance their
              prospects for future academic success. During the first 11 years of its
              experience, participants of the Math-Science Honors Program were students from
              underrepresented minority groups exclusively.  In 1996, the program broadened
              its focus and participation was opened to all Arizona high school students
              meeting the program's academic and socioeconomic critera. Its participants are
              now ninety-seven percent minority.

The institute has had broad impact
              through the participation of 1600 minority high school students, half of whom
              later enrolled in Arizona State University (ASU).  Of those who enrolled at
              ASU, 265 have completed their degrees in science or mathematics, including 15
              students who have earned graduate degrees.  Twenty students are currently in
              graduate programs in science and mathematics. A major strength of the project
              is its sustained existence over the past 15 years.
