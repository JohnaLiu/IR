This one-year award for dissertation enhancement involves
              US-Ireland cooperative research in ethnology and cultural anthropology.  Under
              the guidance of her US advisor, Sherry B. Ortner of Columbia University and
              Irish mentor, Carmel Quinlan of the Centre for Women's Studies, University
              College Cork, Jennifer DeWan will explore the effects of rapid social changes
              augured by European integration and late capitalism on contemporary feminist
              activism in Ireland.  The objective is to determine if the economic success of
              the "Celtic Tiger", Ireland's membership in the European Union, secularization
              and immigration and other factors have dramatically changed the social
              environment in Ireland. Using participant observation and ethnographic
              interviews of the institutions and groups that make up Ireland's fragmented and
              diversified women's movement, the investigator will focus on the methods,
              spaces and subjects that constitute feminist political practices. This will be
              supplemented by textual ethnography, historical and archival research.  The
              research will take place in Ireland's two largest cities, Dublin and
              Cork.

NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US graduate
              student during her one-year residence in Ireland.
