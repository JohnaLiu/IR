Abstract    :
              The Alliance for Improvement of Mathematics Skills PreK-16 (AIMS PK-16) is a
              partnership of nine independent school districts in South Texas and two
              Hispanic-serving institutions of higher education, Del Mar (Community) College
              and Texas A&M University, Kingsville.  The partner school districts serve
              roughly 30,000 students, of whom 61% are minority students and 50% are
              economically disadvantaged students.  The overarching goal of AIMS PK-16 is to
              prepare all students in the partner districts for success in college-level
              mathematics courses by the time that they graduate from high school.  This will
              require the partnership to close significant achievement gaps among student
              groups, especially raising the achievement of a sizeable Hispanic student
              population.  

With its emphasis on mathematics education, AIMS PK-16
              partners will engage preK-16 administrators, teachers, guidance counselors and
              higher education faulty in action research, case studies and analysis of
              student work.  As a basis for establishing a challenging curriculum for all
              students that emphasizes the development of mathematical skills necessary for
              the college classroom, partner school districts teachers and administrators
              will work with higher education faculty to vertically align mathematical
              content in preK-12 courses as they relate to college expectations.  TEXTEAMS
              professional development for teachers, then, will be directed at offering a
              mathematics curriculum that matches these expectations, and in understanding
              and implementing the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) and TEKS-based
              assessments.  To enhance teaching and learning, AIMS PK-16 will support the
              appropriate use of technology to support richer mathematics and problem-solving
              experiences for students.  AIMS PK-16 school districts and university partners
              are committed to serving as a laboratory for research about the effectiveness
              of intervention strategies designed to increase mathematics achievement of all
              students and closing various achievement gaps.
