Abstract    :
              Sara Young directs the American Indian Research Opportunities program at Montana
              State University. Her mentoring is beyond the ordinary, especially when the
              unusually difficult logistical factors of the work are considered. In her
              unique and successful mentoring of students in Montana, she has been able to
              overcome many challenges, such as the demanding geographic environment. Young
              has worked with both students and families to achieve successful outcomes for
              Native American students. She has also worked with a coalition to achieve
              positive results. The rate of students graduating from her program and going on
              to attend college is high as a result of Young's mentoring and of the very
              positive role model that she poses to Native American students.
