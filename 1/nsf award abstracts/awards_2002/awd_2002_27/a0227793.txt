This award is to Montana State University to support
              the activity described below for 36 months.  The proposal was submitted in
              response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF
              02060).
The partners include Montana State University (Lead Institution), MSU
              Techlink Center, Center for Entrepreneurship for the New West, Montana Office
              for Economic Opportunity, Technology Venture Center. The program includes: (1)
              formation of a sustainable, long-term innovation partnership that will provide
              a major engine for the emerging technology sector in Montana, (2) formation of
              an enhanced infrastructure for creating new technology companies in the state,
              (3) recruitment of women and Native Americans for entrepreneurship training and
              new technology-business opportunities, (4) establishment of at least a dozen
              new technology companies in Montana State University's Advanced Technology Park
              and then elsewhere in Montana, and (5) development of a new model for
              technology-business creation in rural states.

Montana currently ranks 50th
              in the United States in annual pay and 48th in the percentage of households at
              the poverty level.  This program will increase the number of new sources of
              higher-paying jobs, mobilize the underrepresented populations in the state, and
              reduce the "brain drain" to other regions.
