Abstract    :
              Dr. Steven G. Greenbaum has mentored minority students in physics for more than
              twenty years. His academic advisorship and mentoring role has supported the
              graduation of Afro-American physicists from MIT and from other prestigious
              schools. Also noteworthy is the outcome of his students professionally. His
              evidence of commitment is embedded in the achievement of his students. The
              emotional support and encouragement for minority students to study science has
              been meritorious; the work with minorities in science is, in general,
              remarkable and likely to be continued.
