Abstract    :
              This research is intended to produce tools to assess potential regional effects
              of global anthropogenic climate change on the structure of North American daily
              hydrology in different seasons.  The PIs will apply climate prediction
              methodology to forecast the probabilities of hydrological weather extremes.  A
              new comprehensive statistical framework will be developed for the description
              of daily precipitation and streamflow data.  Using this framework, the PIs will
              examine variability and predictability of daily hydrological extremes.  They
              will apply statistical methods designed for data with heavy-tailed
              distributions (distributions with relatively large numbers of extreme events
              that can't be accounted for by exponentially decaying tails of traditional
              Probability Density Functions (PDFs).  They will then examine the influence of
              climate forcing in space and time on the shape of seasonal distributions of
              daily hydrology.  The parameters describing the PDF's shape will become
              predictands from which statistical information, e.g., frequencies of extreme
              events, can be derived.

This research has broader impacts including graduate
              student education and research results applied to the important societal issue
              of extreme hydrologic events in the context of a changing climate.
