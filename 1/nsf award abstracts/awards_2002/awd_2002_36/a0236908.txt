Funding is provided to the Potomac Institute For
              Policy Studies to conduct a study to define and document likely S&T trends and
              their impacts on national security over the next 20 years. In order to address
              the goal the following questions will be addressed:

-What S&T trends are
              most likely to yield products to benefit national security?
-What S&T trends
              are likely to pose dangers to our society? 
-How are the important trends
              likely to evolve and what indicators will herald new and significant
              capabilities or threats?
-Who will be the most likely producer of the
              necessary capabilities and threats?
-Are there roadblocks in the way of
              scientific or technological progress that may deter these capabilities and
              threats?  

At least six S&T areas will be examined during the conduct of
              this project: Advanced Materials; Nanotechnology; Life Sciences; Social,
              Behavioral, and Economic Sciences; Energy; and Information Technology.

The
              results of this study will feed into a larger study (under multi-agency
              sponsorship) aimed at suggesting ways to improve the quality of science and
              technology information involved in making decisions on S&T-laden issues at the
              national security level.  This will significantly enhance the nation's ability
              to develop strategies and policies on issues with important scientific and
              technical content.
