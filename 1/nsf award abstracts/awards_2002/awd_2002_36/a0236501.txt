Abstract    :
              This project uses the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-CHEM)
              three-dimensional chemical-transport model to investigate processes controlling
              tropospheric ozone and selected related trace constituents of the troposphere,
              relying heavily on satellite remote-sensing, aircraft and surface station data
              sets to initialize, constrain and evaluate the model.  The high-resolution
              modeling will focus specifically on process and regional studies of selected
              trace gases important to the global environment, placing emphasis on
              interannual variability and an investigation of regional sources and sinks. 
              Work on trace carbon gases will be carried out in collaboration with Daniel
              Jacob (Harvard University).  The Asian region and its effect on the global
              environment will be investigated, including the somewhat novel consideration of
              the influence of European and American emissions on Asian air quality.  The
              project will provide important updated information on concentration fields
              globally of several important tropospheric trace constituents, important for
              projections of future concentrations.  Results will have important
              policy-relevant implications within the global community of nations, especially
              those undergoing rapid economic development.  This award will provide
              educational opportunities for graduate students and a post-doctoral student.
