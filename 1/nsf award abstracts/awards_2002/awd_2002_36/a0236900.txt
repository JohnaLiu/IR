Abstract    :
              The Rustbelt RNA Meeting (RRM) will be held on November 1-2, 2002 in the Lodge
              at Deer Creek State Park & Resort in Mt. Sterling, OH.  The RRM is the only
              major Midwest regional meeting of RNA researchers.  Based on attendance in
              previous years, approximately 100 participants are from institutions in
              Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and adjoining states (though participants from
              farther away are not excluded).  The intellectual objective of the RRM is to
              provide an inexpensive, high caliber, interdisciplinary meeting for RNA
              researchers in the Midwest.  The field of RNA (bio)chemistry continues to
              expand and touches many broader topics due to the middle position of RNA in the
              central dogma of molecular biology.  As a result, research groups need a forum
              where they can hear and discuss new results and techniques in areas of RNA
              research that may be distant from their own but may provide new insights or
              research tools to further their own aims.  The size and organization of the
              meeting provides an excellent environment for discussions between research
              groups, including not only interactions between PIs but also between trainees
              and PIs and between trainees.  With respect to broader impact, the RRM
              emphasizes trainee participation.  In addition to offering opportunities for
              interactions with PIs and other trainees, the RRM provides invaluable
              experience presenting research in a friendly and supportive atmosphere.
