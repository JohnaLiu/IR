This award is a contribution toward support of travel and
              registration costs for participants in the Fourth Gordon Research Conference on
              Polar Marine Science. The conference, scheduled to take place on 16-21 March
              2003 in Ventura, CA and will address the topic of The Changing Polar Oceans:
              Impacts of a Changing Climate on Physical, Chemical, Biological and Coupled
              Systems. The conference will assess the recently documented large-scale,
              interannual changes that have impacted the northern and southern polar ocean
              systems, their physical bases, and their impacts on physical, chemical,
              biological and coupled systems. Characterization of changes as oscillations,
              abrupt shifts or long-term trends will be central to subsequent discussion.
              Impacts of the physical changes on upper ocean biogeochemical systems, such as
              those involving dissolved oxygen uptake and the pCO2 balance, will be
              addressed, as will impacts on benthic-pelagic coupling and the carbon budget.
              Use of biological markers from diatoms and Phaeocystis will be discussed within
              an interannual change context. Impacts of the changing climate on sea ice
              cover, and likely consequences to ice biota and to the exchange of such
              substances as CO2 and DMS, will be considered. An attempt will be made to
              assess aspects of concurrent interannual changes in broader food web
              variability. Both field and modeling results and paleoceanographic
              reconstruction of past conditions will be used in the discussions.
