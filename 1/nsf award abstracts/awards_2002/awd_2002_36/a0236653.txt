Abstract    :
              This is a 5-year continuing award.  Intelligent machines capable of recognizing
              and analyzing human actions will play an important role in next generation
              human-computer interfaces.  This research effort will address development of a
              computational vision framework for recognizing dynamic human movements.  The
              goal is to model the perceptual dynamics associated with human activities to
              automatically identify various action categories and action efforts.  The PI
              will examine a key-feature approach within a three-mode principal components
              framework to learn the expressive features needed for the model to produce
              results qualitatively similar to human judgments of the actions.  Experiments
              will be conducted using motion capture and video data of multiple people
              performing common activities at different efforts.  Results at each stage will
              be compared to perceptual experiments and alternative non-expressive methods. 
              To demonstrate the approach, an automatic surveillance and monitoring
              application will be implemented.  If successful the research should have broad
              impact on human-computer interaction in numerous domains as diverse as
              ergonomic evaluation, sports analysis, and computer animation.   In conjunction
              with the research, the PI will create an educational plan that integrates
              topics on computer vision, human perception, human-computer interaction, and
              computer animation into a new cross-disciplinary curriculum that combines
              classroom discussions with practical laboratory experience, and which fosters
              undergraduate research-related opportunities.
