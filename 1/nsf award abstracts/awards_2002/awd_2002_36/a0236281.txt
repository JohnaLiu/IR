Title:  SGER NanoKids Education
              Outreach Project-Proof of Concept


Ten different configurations of
              molecules resembling human stick figures have been synthesized in the PI's
              laboratory.  The molecules as a group are dubbed the NanoKids.  By portraying
              these molecules in a series of computer-animated lessons, the PI intends to
              develop a proof-of-concept support curriculum for introducing students in the
              6-12 grade to the molecular environment.  The longer vision is to develop
              extensive lessons based on the National Science and Technology Education
              standards.  This SGER proposal is to obtain the funds for the proof-of-concept
              and to prepare for the upcoming submission of the full proposal.
