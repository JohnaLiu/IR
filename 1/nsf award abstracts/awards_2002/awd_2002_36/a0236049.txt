Abstract    :
              Creating a visual display archive 
Emilia P. Martins

Animal behavior is the
              one of the most complex phenotypes and that complexity is reflected in the
              myriad of ways in which it has been measured and recorded by scientific
              researchers. Even simple storage, access and retrieval of behavioral
              information presents a difficult problem because of the variety of forms in
              which behavioral information is preserved and disseminated. Coherent, effective
              combination of the data to address important questions in animal behavior or
              for future communication with databases in other fields (e.g., genomics)
              requires even more effort. Although recent years have seen the creation of
              several public databases of biological information, there are still relatively
              few in animal behavior and even fewer which have even begun to address the
              considerable difficulties of fast, effective interaction among the huge variety
              of possible behavioral data types. This proposal is to transfer a large
              existing collection of lizard display footage from decaying 16mm film to
              electronic form, preserving it for posterity and making it accessible to other
              researchers. The lizard archive will be organized through a database and
              metadata tag structure that is sufficiently general to allow for future
              addition of visual display data from a wide diversity of other species. A
              series of web pages will be created to illustrate the benefits of such an
              archive to the biological community.
