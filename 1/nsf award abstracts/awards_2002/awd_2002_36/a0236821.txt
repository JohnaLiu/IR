Abstract    :
              Abstract
     When we judge the magnitude of a stimulus-the brightness of a
              light, heaviness of a weight, or duration of a sound-we are mapping that aspect
              onto another dimension, typically a numerical one. Even when comparing two
              stimuli directly, that comparison may be mediated by a neural representation
              akin to counting. A counter is a neural device that adds sensory action
              potentials, or, in the case of time, pacemaker pulses. Inaccuracies reveal the
              structure of the counter: Proportional error in sensory discriminations -
              Weber's law or scalar timing - is the most general laws of psychophysics; All
              models of counters must yield it. Minuscule deviations from it and from linear
              timing further strongly constrain candidates. Models of failure modes of
              counters will be developed and tested. Examples are: Failing to set a higher
              bank (e.g., 10's) when a lower one resets (the Y2K glitch); failing to reset;
              conditioning of weights in other than a power series. These will be compared to
              data collected on the discriminative and productive abilities of rats and
              pigeons, in particular: (1) mean performances in discriminating and producing
              temporal intervals; (2) Weber functions; (3) count distributions and
              hitting-times. Alternate weighting schemes for the accumulator that arise from
              conditioning will be studied. These schematic models will be integrated with
              realistic neural networks. The likelihood of this theory will compared with
              those of other current timing theories given these data. Results will be
              applied to information transmission and signal detection theories.
