Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to use peptide architecture to incorporate
              bifunctional catalysis into small molecules.  Combinatorial synthesis will be
              used in conjunction with a high-throughput fluorescence-based screen and a
              subsequent chiral GC assay to optimize the reactivity of beta-turn peptides. 
              These small enzyme mimics have been shown to function as catalysts, and will be
              used to achieve kinetic resolution of simple alcohols, enantioselective ketene
              additions, enantioselective carbon-carbon bond formation with various
              nucleophiles, and enantioselective conjugate addition of azides and thiols to
              achiral enamides.

With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr.
              Scott. J. Miller of the Department of Chemistry at Boston College.  Professor
              Miller will focus his research on the development of catalysts that mimic
              enzymes found in nature for the synthesis of new pharmaceuticals.  The
              educational activities of the award will include the training of graduate
              students, undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows in a
              multidisciplinary environment.
