The goal of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research
              (SGER) project is to provide rock-magnetic and analytical transmission electron
              microscope data for crystallographically oriented magnetite inclusions in
              silicates (COMIS) in order to explore the conditions of origin of COMIS, and
              the fidelity with which they record magnetic fields under those conditions. The
              research plan involves analyzing a number of COMIS in diverse samples in order
              to evaluate if the results obtained are robust enough to use them as
              paleomagnetic indicators. If this SGER is successful, the techniques developed
              for COMIS will then be used for a variety of paleomagnetic applications,
              including measurement of geomagnetic paleointensity and tectonic applications
              of paleomagnetic data. The results will also be useful for evaluating the
              possibility that stable magnetization of the oceanic crust, and of magnetic
              anomalies on other planets, is due to COMIS.
