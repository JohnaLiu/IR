Abstract    :
              The goals of this workshop are:  (1) To assess the state-of-the-art and to
              address the research needs in the thermal aspects of various material removal
              processes, in view of the rapid advancements in new experimental techniques,
              numerical methods, and analytical aspects (due to the availability of powerful,
              inexpensive personal computers); and (2) To provide the thermal basis for
              addressing "green manufacturing" which is so critical for the protection of the
              health and safety of the environment and associated personnel of the shop
              floor.

The focus of the workshop will be thermal aspects of various material
              removal processes, such as metal cutting, grinding, and polishing.  Various
              experimental, analytical, and numerical techniques will be critically reviewed
              and research needs and opportunities will be identified.
