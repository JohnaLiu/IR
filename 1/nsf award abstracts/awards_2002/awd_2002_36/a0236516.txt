Abstract    :
              A series of workshops in Puerto Rico will lay the foundation for the development
              and deployment of an island-wide regional research and education network.  The
              workshops will be staged as three related events:

(1)  the first workshop
              will provide an introduction to the potential of a regional educational network
              in Puerto Rico and the feasibility, need and advantages of creating one,
(2) 
              the second workshop will provide a hands-on strategic technical planning
              session for interested campuses; and
(3)  the third workshop will provide a
              hands-on strategic funding planning session.

Each workshop will be one day
              to one and one half days long to maximize participation.  The workshops are
              tentatively scheduled for November 2002, January 2003, and March 2003 to ensure
              that the participants have sufficient time to galvanize commitments between
              each workshop.
