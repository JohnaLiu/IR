Abstract    :
              Krishnan Balasubramanian of UC-Davis is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to develop and apply relativistic quantum
              chemical methods to study the clusters of main group, semiconductor, and
              super-heavy elements.  Spectra, properties, and reactivities will be predicted
              in order to interpret recent experimental findings.  Also, relativistic quantum
              dynamics with computed potential energy surfaces that include spin-orbit
              coupling will be investigated.

Precursors in metal-organic chemical vapor
              deposition used in semiconductor production
include novel heterocyclic
              molecules.  Experimental studies of these species will be aided by the insight,
              interpretation, and prediction of their properties provided by this research. 
              In addition, the chemistry of super-heavy elements, which have a very short
              lifetime, can only be understood by coupling the guidance of theoretical
              calculations to available empirical data.
