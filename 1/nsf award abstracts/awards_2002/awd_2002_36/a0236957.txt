Abstract    :
              A grant has been awarded to Dr. David Hafner at the New Mexico Museum of Natural
              History (NMMNH) to study the evolution of arid regions in the southwestern
              United States and northern Mexico. This is collaborative research being
              conducted with scientists at the University of Nevada Las Vegas and the Centro
              de Investigaciones Biologicas del Noroeste (CIBNOR) in Baja California Sur,
              Mexico. The NMMNH's portion of the project ($135,000 over 3 years) will support
              fieldwork in Mexico and the U.S., and resulting specimens will become part of
              the permanent research collections of NMMNH and CIBNOR. By comparing genetic
              differences among populations of selected arid-adapted rodents, the scientists
              will reconstruct in detail the complex history of these diverse desert regions
              over the last 5.5 million years, including episodes of inundation by seaways,
              origin of mountain ranges, and cyclical climatic changes during the last "Ice
              Ages." The study will be based on sequence data of mitochondrial DNA from over
              1600 specimens collected from throughout the desert regions. 

This project
              employs a new and powerful analytical approach that should greatly improve
              efforts to provide realistic reconstructions of complicated biotic histories.
              By identifying regional centers of distinct biodiversity, the study will
              provide insight into the ecology and conservation of North America's regional
              deserts. This is a continuing collaboration between U.S. and Mexican
              scientists, building on a previous NSF grant (1996-1999), and involves graduate
              and undergraduate students from both countries in field and laboratory aspects.
              Results of the project will be disseminated through academic channels
              (publication and scientific meetings) and through public programs and exhibits
              at the NMMNH. In addition to the Museum's 350,000 annual visitors, the project
              will reach targeted school groups through Proyecto Futuro (an NSF-funded
              program for Spanish-speaking students) and Way Out West, a NMMNH-produced video
              program carried nationally on public television.
