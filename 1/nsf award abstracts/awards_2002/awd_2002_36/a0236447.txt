Abstract    :
              This grant will partially support for a 3-day workshop on using operations
              research to improve health care delivery.  Approximately 40-50 participants
              will meet in Ann Arbor, Michigan, September 25-27, 2002. A number of recent
              conferences, including an NSF workshop in Atlanta and one sponsored by the
              National Academy of Engineering, both in 2001, documented the opportunities for
              engineering to contribute to improving the quality and efficiency of health
              care delivery.  This workshop would bring together experts from the health care
              and operations research communities to identify critical research issues that
              can drive operational improvements in health care delivery systems.  The
              workshop would be jointly hosted by the University of Michigan which is a
              leader in both medical and health care research.
