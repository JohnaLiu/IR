The Universe is believed to consist primarily
              of dark matter, some unknown substance that makes its presence known only by
              its gravitational effects. Among these effects is the deflection of starlight,
              also known as gravitational lensing: objects seen behind a dark matter
              concentration will have their appearance distorted as the light rays pass the
              dark matter. In some cases this lensing distortion is dramatic, but our view of
              nearly every galaxy in the Universe is distorted to a very small degree by
              intervening dark matter. By measuring these weak gravitational lensing effects,
              one can map the distribution of the dark matter. The distortion typically
              amounts to a <1% elongation of a background galaxy, so exploitation of weak
              gravitational lensing requires the astronomer to measure 100,000 to 10,000,000
              galaxy shapes, and to pay careful attention to slight optical defects that can
              mimic gravitational lensing. The rewards are great, however, since the ability
              to "see" dark matter can answer many of the most important questions about the
              Universe. The work under this grant will apply new techniques to the analysis
              of weak lensing data, and advance the precision of these measurements to the
              few-percent level using data being gathered by the Deep Lens Survey and other
              large imaging surveys. With these data it will be possible to plot the
              evolution of dark matter halos around galaxies since redshift 0.5. Other
              existing and new data will be analyzed to map the dark matter in massive galaxy
              clusters.
