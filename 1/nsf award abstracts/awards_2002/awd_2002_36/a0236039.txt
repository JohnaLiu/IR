Abstract    :
              This project will address how insects use structural proteins, catechols,
              oxidative enzymes, and chitin to stabilize their exoskeletons. The exoskeleton
              is primarily composed of two structural polymers, protein and chitin. The
              cuticle proteins are cross-linked by quinones derived from catechols by a
              process called sclerotization, a vital metabolic step that occurs during each
              stage of insect development. This interdisciplinary project will investigate
              the interactions of quinonoid metabolites of catecholic precursors with
              cuticular proteins from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. The research will
              test a hypothesis that sclerotization involves the formation of carbon-nitrogen
              cross-links between the nucleophilic imidazole nitrogens of histidine and the
              ring or side-chain carbons of o-quinones and p-quinone methides derived from
              catechols. A second hypothesis to be tested is that differences in hardness and
              flexibility from distinct regions of an exoskeleton are due to the occurrence
              of different sets of proteins and cross-linking agents expressed by the
              underlying epidermis.  The first objective is to identify and characterize
              proteins expressed in cuticles with different physical properties. The cuticle
              of the M. sexta larval abdomen is soft and flexible, whereas the pupal abdomen
              is rigid and the larval head capsule quite hard. cDNAs obtained for proteins
              that are expressed in pupal abdominal cuticles, larval abdominal cuticle, and
              head capsule will be used to study the pattern of expression of the
              corresponding genes  with regard to development and anatomy. The second
              objective is to investigate the structure and properties of two M. sexta
              laccases. Laccases oxidize catechols to quinones or quinone methides.  Although
              laccases have been proposed to be important in insect cuticle sclerotization,
              they have received little study. cDNAs for two M. sexta laccases have been
              isolated, and their expression patterns characterized. The insect laccases are
              composed of a catalytic domain similar to those of fungal and plant laccases,
              as well as a unique amino-terminal domain not present in other known proteins.
              M. sexta laccases 1 and 2 will be expressed as recombinant proteins for
              characterization of their enzymatic properties, investigation of the function
              of the amino-terminal and catalytic domains, and for use in model
              sclerotization reactions described in objective 3.  The third objective is to
              investigate biochemical and biophysical properties of cuticle using model
              sclerotization reactions. Selected proteins hypothesized to be responsible for
              formation of rigid or flexible cuticle will be expressed as recombinant
              proteins and used in model sclerotization reactions including a catechol, a
              phenoloxidase, and in the presence or absence of chitin or a chitin derivative.
              Protein-protein cross-links, protein-carbohydrate cross-links, and the effects
              of different catechols and cuticle proteins on the physical properties of
              cross-linked protein hydrogels and chitin-protein films produced in vitro will
              be investigated and compared with cuticles from different anatomical regions of
              M. sexta.  Site directed mutagenesis experiments will test a hypothesis that
              histidine residues are involved in protein cross-linking during sclerotization.
              

The exoskeleton of insects is composed of cuticle proteins and a
              polysaccharide called chitin.  Each time an insect molts, these components of
              the exoskeleton are synthesized and then they are chemically cross-linked in a
              process called sclerotization. Sclerotization results in a light-weight
              material with unusual strength. This project investigates the chemistry of
              sclerotization, which is not yet well understood.  Model sclerotization
              reactions will be carried out to determine how the cuticle proteins are linked
              to each other and to chitin.  The biochemistry of insect cuticle sclerotization
              may be a useful target for design of novel methods for controlling insect pests
              of agriculture and insects that are vectors of diseases.  New types of
              cross-linked biopolymers, based on the chemistry of cuticle sclerotization, may
              have potential uses in medicine and industry.
