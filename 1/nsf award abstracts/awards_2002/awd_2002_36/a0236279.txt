Abstract    :
              In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Hartland will study the material properties of nanospheres
              and nanorods by means of ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy.  Specifically,
              the technique relies on beats due to coherently excited vibrational modes that
              result from short pulse laser illumination.  Electronic properties are probed
              by examining electron-electron and electron-phonon coupling.  Six individual
              projects will be undertaken, ranging from measurements of the symmetric
              breathing modes of metal nanoparticles at high temperatures, through ultrafast
              studies of electron-electron interactions in bimetallic particles, to
              measurements of the time-resolved anisotropy of single Au nanorods.  

The
              proposed research includes the development of new methods that will result in
              applications to the technology of nanoparticles.  Teaching and training of
              students will be done at all levels, inclusive of research participation.  The
              students will thereby receive training in one of the forefront areas of
              materials science and chemistry in preparation for advanced studies or
              employment in industry, academia, or government laboratories.
