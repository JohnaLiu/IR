Abstract    :
              Dr. Anna-Louise Reysenbach of Portland State University and Dr. John Heidelberg
              of The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) have been awarded a grant to
              sequence the entire genomes of two new heat-loving (thermophilic)
              microorganisms. The project will be completed in 1 year and serve as an
              educational template for a K-12 teachers workshop. The data will be publicly
              available.
These two microbes are of interest as they are closely related but
              one (Persephonella marina) was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent in
              the Pacific Ocean and the other (strain Az-Fu1) from a terrestrial hot spring
              on the island of Sao Miguel, Azores. They both use inorganic chemicals for
              their energy and their source of carbon. In their natural environment, members
              of this group are often associated with mineral precipitates such as iron
              sulfides, pointing to their potential role in removal of contaminating metals
              from the environment. Furthermore, the deep position of these isolates within
              the eubacterial domain on the universal tree of life suggests that they may be
              good models for studying the features of early evolution of life on Earth. This
              is a Microbial Genome Sequencing Award funded through a collaborative program
              between the National Science Foundation and the Department of Agriculture.
