Abstract    :
              Cellulose biosynthesis is one of the most important biological processes on
              earth. Although we use several cellulose products every day, molecular details
              of how trees synthesize cellulose are still shrouded in mystery. Dr. Joshi's
              long-term CAREER goal is to advance a comprehensive understanding of cellulose
              biosynthesis in trees. Recent molecular genetic evidence suggests that plant
              genomes host a rather large cellulose synthase (CesA) gene family and multiple
              but distinct CesAs are involved in primary and secondary cell wall formation in
              Arabidopsis. Dr. Joshi's lab has isolated three secondary wall-related CesA
              genes from aspen namely, PtrCesA1, PtrCesA2 and PtrCesA3 that are coordinately
              expressed during the secondary cell wall formation. Here further research will
              be carried out to examine whether these three CesA genes are functionally
              associated with better quality cellulose production in trees.
 
The four main
              objectives of this proposal are: 1) to examine expression of PtrCesA1, PtrCesA2
              and PtrCesA3 proteins in developing xylem tissues of aspen; 2) to delineate the
              spatial and temporal regulation of PtrCesA1, PtrCesA2 and PtrCesA3 genes; 3) to
              inhibit the expression of a specific PtrCesA gene in transgenic aspen trees
              through RNAi technology for functional analysis; and 4) to perform sense
              over-expression of three secondary CesAs to study the impact of such genetic
              manipulations on growth and wood characteristics of transgenic trees. This
              research will establish a firm experimental basis for metabolic engineering of
              secondary cell wall associated cellulose biosynthesis in trees that has many
              fundamental and commercial implications.

The educational goals of this
              CAREER project include: 1) graduate program development in Bioinformatics and
              Biotechnology; 2) establishment of a lecture series in Plant Molecular
              Genetics; 3) integration of research activities into undergraduate and graduate
              teaching and educational outreach activities; and 4) providing research
              training opportunities for at least two undergraduate students, two Ph. D
              graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher in the field of cellulose
              biogenesis in trees.
