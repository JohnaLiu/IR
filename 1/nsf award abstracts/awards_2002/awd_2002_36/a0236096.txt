Abstract    :
              Ectomycorrhizal (EM )spore banks are a fundamental,but poorly
              studied
component,of plant-fungal community ecology.EM spore banks can
              provide
the inoculum necessary for tree recruitment following severe
              disturbance and
may facilitate tree invasion into bordering non-forested
              areas.Rhizopogon species
are the most abundant component of spore banks in
              many western North
American pinaceous ecosystems,and in some forest-border
              settings they appear
to be virtually the entire spore bank.This proposal is
              focused on understanding
the spatial and temporal dynamics of Rhizopogon spore
              banks in the context of
cyclic fire and pine regeneration.A conceptual model
              for these interactions is
proposed,and five specific hypotheses related to the
              model are tested.These
hypotheses focus on differences in spore longevity and
              spore dispersal among
Rhizopogon species,and on differences in mode and
              frequency of dispersal within
mature-forests and post-fire forests.Measured
              parameters include:i)spatial
pattern of the spore shadow in forest border
              zones,ii)current dispersal rates and
modes into these zones,iii)spore
              longevity of three key Rhizopogon species and
iv)longevity of complex native
              spore banks.Hypotheses will be tested by
combining the techniques of
              bioassays,molecular ecology,large-scale spatial
sampling,and seed bank
              ecology.The work addresses a crucial,but essentially
unstudied,component of
              community ecology (i.e.,EM spore banks),and
provides an analogous system in
              which to test ideas developed for plant seed
banks.The broader impacts of this
              work are its direct relationship to forest
regeneration and expansion;the
              ability to predict the spatial and temporal extent
of the EM spore banks will
              provide forest managers with a rational way to assess
the likelihood of EM
              inoculum in highly disturbed systems.
