Development of the MERMAID float: an
              autonomous vehicle for recording regional earthquakes within the world
              oceans

PROJECT SUMMARY
The PIs propose to test whether untethered floats
              can record arrivals of teleseismic P waves while drifting at depths of 1-2 km.
              Specifically, they propose to construct a prototype float for recording
              earthquakes within the oceans. They have named this float MERMAID (Mobile
              Earthquake Recorder in Marine Areas by Independent Divers). If the proposed
              pilot project is successful, it will opens up the possibility of using existing
              monitoring efforts to fill in the large gaps in global teleseismic coverage
              posed within the ocean basins, and will significantly enhance our ability to
              image the deeper regions of the Earth through tomographic inversions
