Abstract    :
              The original proposal seeks funding to build an Antarctic Infrared Observatory
              (AIRO), a new 2-m diameter infrared telescope to be deployed at the South Pole.
              Antarctica provides a uniquely low thermal background for ground-based infrared
              astronomy. With only a modest aperture an infrared telescope in Antarctica can
              achieve extraordinary sensitivity. AIRO intends to exploit these unique
              conditions surveying the infrared sky and performing temporal monitoring
              studies. However, AIRO currently lacks a detailed conceptual design for the
              telescope and for its proposed first instrument, a 2 color (K + L, and K + M
              band) wide-field imaging camera. Developing such a design is critical to AIRO's
              success. The design will flow from the scientific requirements that maximize
              the scientific return from the low Antarctic thermal backgrounds. During the
              period covered by the revised effort, the proposers will (1) establish the
              detailed scientific requirements for the telescope and camera, (2) develop a
              conceptual optical and mechanical design for the infrared camera, (3) develop a
              conceptual optical design for the telescope, and (4) obtain robust cost
              estimates for the camera and telescope. This engineering study will increase
              the safety margin and mitigate risk in building the entire telescope in
              Antarctica.  Moreover, a more realistic assessment of the technical and
              scientific requirements will result in a more accurate cost estimate.
