Abstract
This research program will investigate thermal-electrical
              energy conversion phenomena in vacuum electron field emission microstructures
              with synthetic diamond and diamond-like cathodes. An improved thermodynamic
              performance is expected due to diamond's semiconductor band structure, which
              produces a selective emission of high-energy electrons, and microstructural
              features, such as micron-scale pyramidal tips that enhance electrical fields.
              Guided by new theoretical and computational analyses, new experiments will be
              conducted to characterize thermodynamic performance for low-temperature
              refrigeration and high-temperature electrical power generation. 
In this
              program, arrays of micron-scale pyramidal diamond tips will be fabricated, and
              their ability to act as refrigeration and power generation devices will be
              studied. A working device could include more than ten million tips per square
              centimeter and could provide new solutions to emerging needs in portable
              cooling technology and mobile electrical power generation. Further, the
              efficiency and simplicity promised by this concept could improve large-scale
              energy systems, such as renewable solar energy converters.
