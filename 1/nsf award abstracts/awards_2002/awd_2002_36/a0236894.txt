Abstract    :
              This interagency transfer to the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies
              supports publication of a workshop report, associated with the workshop held on
              "Air Pollution and Climate Forcing" held April 29-May 3, 2002 in Honolulu,
              Hawaii.  The purpose of the workshop was to illuminate the role of air
              pollution as a global climate forcing and to place climate-related impacts of
              air pollution in the context of its other human health and environmental
              impacts.  The workshop itself was an interagency effort, held at the East-West
              Center of the University of Hawaii, and sponsored by the National Aeronautics
              and Space Administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
              the National Science Foundation, the Hewlett Foundation, the California Air
              Resources Board, the California Energy Commission, the International Pacific
              Research Center, and the East-West Center.  Specifically, this transfer covers
              the production of 500 copies of the report, "Air Pollution as a Climate
              Forcing: A Workshop."
