In many of the world most exceptional fossil deposits,
              extraction of fossils from the matrix is difficult, and fossils are often so
              small that serial sectioning is uniformative.  Nowhere is this more true than
              in the Neoproterozoic, where much of the fossil record is soft-bodied,
              microscopic, preserved in 3D, and/or entombed in a manner inimical to
              mechanical or chemical extraction techniques.  Microfocus X-ray computed
              tomography (microCT) enables nondestructive visualization of the
              three-dimensional internal structure of geological and biological samples, and
              offers a new manner in which to examine such fossils.  This grant will support
              purchase of a 100 kV Skyscan 1072 microCT instrument, allowing visualization
              and creation of models of structures as small as 500nm.  This instrument will
              contribute substantially to undergraduate and faculty research at Amherst
              College, as well as at other five-College Consortium institutions.
