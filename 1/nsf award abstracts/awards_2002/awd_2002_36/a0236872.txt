Abstract    :
              In the search for new, improved energy systems for the 21st century, the
              emphasis is on environmentally friendly, efficient means of energy conversion
              and storage. High temperature fuel cells offer energy conversion efficiencies
              as high as 70% and low pollutant emissions, but significant technical and cost
              problems remain to be overcome for power plants utilizing natural gas.  There
              is also considerable excitement about other applications of high temperature
              fuel cells including transportation and portable generation. High temperature
              fuel cells offer considerable promise for working with the hydrocarbon fuels
              required for these applications. Closely allied to these applications in fuel
              cell technology is the use of electrochemical reactors for the industrially
              important electrocatalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons. In the long term solid
              oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology is foreseen as a candidate for a much more
              efficient electrolysis of steam and carbon dioxide.  In summary, the high
              temperature electrochemical oxidation of hydrocarbons is an area of
              considerable strategic, environmental and economical importance.

The purpose
              of the proposed NSF/DOE/ESF workshop, planned for Strasbourg, France on
              December 9-11, 2002, is to promote U.S./European collaborative investigations
              on the solid-state electrochemical oxidation of hydrocarbons.  The proposed
              workshop, which will cover both fundamental and applied aspects, will be unique
              in its focus on scientific issues related to hydrocarbon anode materials.  The
              Program will facilitate the exchange of ideas, educate the participant's groups
              regarding state-of-the-art worldwide activities, promote educational and
              research opportunities abroad for young scientists, and develop common programs
              of activity.
