This grant will support the acquisition a 144 CPU Beowulf
              cluster of PCs for performing numerical experiments related to understanding
              convection in the mantle and the outer core. Many individual projects fall
              under these themes, with mantle convection investigations focusing on
              compositional differentiation, melting, and plate tectonics, and core
              investigations focusing initially on a joint numerical-laboratory study of
              magnetoconvection.  The cluster will also be used for teaching purposes and
              will be open to other members of the Earth and Space Sciences Department and
              national and international collaborators of the UCLA Geodynamics group.
