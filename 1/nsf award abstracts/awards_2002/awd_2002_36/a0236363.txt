Abstract    :
              When animals or plants from genetically divergent populations interbreed, the
              resulting hybrids often show reduced performance (hybrid breakdown) relative to
              their parents.  This is especially true in second generation (F2) hybrids,
              where incompatible genotypes may arise via recombination.  The proposed work
              uses the marine copepod Tigriopus californicus as a model system for analyses
              of the molecular mechanisms underlying hybrid breakdown.  This project has two
              parts.  In the first, experiments focus on interactions between nuclear and
              mitochondrial genes, testing the hypothesis that hybridization disrupts energy
              production in mitochondria.   The second part of the study tests the hypothesis
              that hybridization disrupts transcription of rRNA genes and this results in
              reduced rates of protein synthesis (and reduced performance) in hybrids. 
              

Hybrid breakdown is widespread in nature and has important ramifications in
              medicine, agriculture and conservation biology.  Results from this project may
              aid in understanding: (1) the growing number of human diseases known to be
              associated with mtDNA and nuclear gene mutations which disrupt mitochondrial
              function,  (2) the role of gene interactions in agriculture, where vigorous F1
              hybrid strains often give rise to poor-performing F2 hybrids, and (3) the
              extent to which wildlife management and conservation practices should restrict
              movement of organisms among geographic locales. The project will also provide
              excellent training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral
              researchers.
