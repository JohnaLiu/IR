Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Carol Espy-Wilson will conduct
              three years of interdisciplinary research. This project combines knowledge and
              techniques from engineering, speech science, and computational linguistics to
              develop a robust automatic speech recognition system that works well for a
              large and diverse population. This project includes the development of (a)
              acoustic parameters that target the linguistic information in the speech
              signal, and (b) a new paradigm for recognition that integrates current speech
              knowledge with a powerful statistical framework.  

The knowledge-based
              speech recognition system serves as a model of the early stages of speech
              perception. Its development is a tool for understanding and coping with
              variation in speech that occurs within and across speakers due to differences
              in gender, age and emotional states. New insights will be gained in the areas
              of speech production, speech perception, and acoustic phonetics. Further,
              different components of the system can serve as speech analysis tools to be
              used in various applications including speech coding, automatic speech
              transcription, speech enhancement, and speech training aids for speech
              pathologists and their clients.
