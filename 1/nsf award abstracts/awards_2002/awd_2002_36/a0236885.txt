Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will monitor hydroclimate
              aspects of the ongoing extreme drought in the U.S. southwest.  Project
              resources will be used to continue field observations related to surface energy
              and water exchanges in the core drought region, well past the duration of the
              field-phase of the International H2O Project (IHOP).  The collected data will
              be invaluable for both monitoring and understanding the causes and impact of
              severe droughts.  Drs. Blanken (Univ. of Colorado) and Grossman (Colorado
              Research Associates) will produce a quantified description of surface
              conditions by making soil moisture and temperature, and evaporation
              measurements, and place the collected data in context of other flux
              measurements in the region.  Upon completion of the project, detailed
              measurements will have been made at IHOP's "Site 10" from May 19 - November 1,
              2002.  The obtained land-surface condition data set will be invaluable in
              capturing the hydroclimate evolution into drought conditions, and should
              facilitate improvements in modeling of land-surface processes that are critical
              for drought development.  This project is being supported by ATM's Large-scale
              and Mesoscale Dynamic Meteorology Programs, and EAR's Hydrologic Sciences
              Program.
