This project consists of an analysis of
              the trajectories of RAFOS floats, deployed as part of the KAPEX experiment
              around the southern tip of Africa, in combination with ancillary data from
              surface drifters and satellite-borne altimeters.  Preliminary analysis of these
              trajectories show that many of them were trapped in Agulhas eddies. A
              motivation for this work is the belief that Agulhas eddies both provide a
              significant conduit for flow from the Indian Ocean into the Atlantic and stir
              the ocean in the south-eastern Atlantic.  The proposed analysis seeks to
              summarize the life history and statistics (including: number, size, swirl
              velocity, translational velocity, and the interactions of eddies with each
              other and with bathymetry).  The investigator will compare the details of the
              trajectories with output from various numerical models of the region and
              collaborate with a German investigator in mapping the intermediate-depth
              velocity field in the S. Atlantic.
