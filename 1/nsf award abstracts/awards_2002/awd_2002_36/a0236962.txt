Abstract    :
              With this award, the Special Projects Program of the Division of Chemistry is
              supporting Dr. Thomas J. Wenzel of the Department of Chemistry at Bates
              College, who will organize and conduct a workshop entitled the "Undergraduate
              Research Summit".  The workshop will examine issues involved in undertaking and
              sustaining chemistry research at predominantly undergraduate institutions
              (PUIs).   The summit will be developed by a 12 person steering committee
              working in close collaboration with the Chemistry Division of the Council on
              Undergraduate Research.  The workshop will be attended by a diverse range of
              stakeholders including people from a variety of types of PUIs, government
              agencies and laboratories, and professional organizations. The Chemistry
              Division of CUR will lead in disseminating the report and working to implement
              its recommendations.
