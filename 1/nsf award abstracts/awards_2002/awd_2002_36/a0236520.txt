Abstract    :
              
The American Association for the Advancement of Science, on behalf of
              theInternational Council for Science (ICSU) Committee for Capacity Building in
              Science(CCBS), requests support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for
              the planning and implementation of an international conference to be held in
              Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from September 21-23, 2002. The 3 day conference would
              be organized by the ICSU (ICSU) Committee for Capacity Building in Science
              (CCBS) and would be held in conjunction with the ICSU General Assembly, also in
              Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The premise of the conference is that high quality
              basic science and mathematics education is a requirement for sustainable
              development around the globe. To meet this requirement, the very poor quality
              of science and mathematics education must be addressed, particularly in
              developing countries.  The focus of the conference is to discuss, develop and
              initiate programs of action to promote the improvement of science and
              mathematics education around the world. The conference is primarily intended
              for educators, scientists and policy makers in both developing and developed
              countries who work at the K-8 levels. The conference will provide examples of
              collaborative models that connect scientists and educators such as through
              informal groups, professional science organizations and academies of science.
              It will also address and analyze international science and mathematics reform
              efforts and continue the work of ICSU to build a community of scientists deeply
              engaged in and committed to the improvement of basic education.
