Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

This is a proposal from the Global Carbon Project (GCP), a joint
              activity of IGBP, WCRP, and IHDP. The proposal is for partial support of an
              international meeting to synthesize recent progress in understanding of the
              global carbon cycle and the relevance of that understanding to progress toward
              stabilization of atmospheric CO2. The workshop, scheduled for February 3-7,
              2003, in Ubatuba, Brazil, will lead to a rapidly published book, based on the
              model of the Dahlem Conferences. The book will appear by November 1, 2003.
