Abstract    :
              Phase I activities associated with construction of a deep-ice neutrino detector
              known as IceCube (for cubic kilometer detector) will be carried out.  This is
              an MREFC project.  The activities include: 1) construction of a movable
              enhanced hot water drill system (EHWDS), including the needed drill camp
              facilities, suitable for drilling 45 cm diameter, 2.5 km deep holes in the ice
              at the South Pole at a rate of at least 16 holes per drilling season in a fuel
              efficient manner requiring 8000 gallons of fuel per hole; 2) construction of
              specialized detectors for in-ice applications; 3) data acquisition and data
              handling hardware and software development; 4) system engineering for
              construction and deployment of the drill system and IceCube detector array; 5)
              testing of all systems; and 6) establishment of associated management system. 
              This work will be carried out taking into consideration the need to operate
              this equipment reliably and safely in the extreme Antarctic environment.  This
              Phase I work will set the stage for implementation of the full IceCube
              construction project for deployment of 80 strings of 64 optical modules
              (consisting of photomultiplier tubes and associated electronics) each that are
              to be inserted into the holes drilled using the EHWDS, frozen into the ice, and
              operated in conjunction with a corresponding data acquisition, data handling,
              and data analysis system.  The IceCube detector array will open a new window on
              the universe and its origin and evolution by its ability to detect high energy
              neutrinos from cosmological events.  Education will be a part of the overall
              IceCube project, but is not a part of this Phase I award.
