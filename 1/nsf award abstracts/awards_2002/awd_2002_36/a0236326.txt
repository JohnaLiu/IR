This award is an
              SGER to support reconnaissance studies of Mt. Cleveland, a remote, hazardous,
              and poorly studied volcano in the Aleutian arc. The PI will sample and analyze
              the volcano's eruptive products to determine their age, composition, and
              origin. Study of this volcano is important because it may offer unique insight
              into the generation of magmas at convergent margins. The ocean floor subducted
              beneath this volcano contains a fracture zone, a rare occurrence that will help
              constrain the contribution of the subducted slab to magmatism. This volcano is
              also a hazard to aviation and erupted last year. This work will aid in hazard
              assessment. This SGER fulfills the merit review criteria in terms of
              intellectual merit and the broader impact of the research, as the data obtained
              will help the community at large. The award also promotes an early-career
              female scientist.
