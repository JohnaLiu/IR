This grant is to help support travel and registration costs for
              about 18 students and post-doctoral fellows to attend the 2003 International C.
              elegans Meeting.  This is the only international meeting exclusively devoted to
              research on C. elegans.  Workers in the field regard this as the most important
              meeting they attend in the years in which a C. elegans meeting is held.  A
              meeting devoted exclusively to C. elegans research can achieve many aims
              impossible at mixed symposia: far greater knowledge can be assumed in the
              audience, much more sophisticated discussion is possible, and an integrated
              approach to the biology of the organism can be pursued.  

The meeting will
              be at UCLA from June 29 to July 3, 2003 and will attract about 1800
              participants in total.  This meeting provides a forum for all researchers
              studying C. elegans to present and discuss results on a broad range of topics
              related to C. elegans biology, including: programmed cell death, functional
              genomics, aging, RNAi, and germ line biology.  The meeting will also attract
              and inform researchers who are currently not using C. elegans as their primary
              model.  The meeting will promote and showcase the research of younger
              scientists (graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and assistant
              professors) including women and minorities.  At the last meeting in 2001, 99%
              of presentations were given by young researchers.  Finally, the meeting will
              provide a forum for the exchange of methods, mutants and DNA clones.  The
              meeting will have special "workshops" set aside for this goal.  Funding for a
              second meeting in 2005 is also planned.
