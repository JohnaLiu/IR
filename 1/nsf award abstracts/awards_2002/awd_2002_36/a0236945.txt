Abstract    :
              A Near InfraRed Imaging Magnetograph (IRIM) and a real-time image reconstruction
              system will be designed, developed, and deployed by the PI and student
              assistants.  The effort capitalizes on the new Center for Solar Research (CfSR)
              optical laboratories, which present an ideal environment to involve students in
              a coordinated program of instrument construction and research.  After the
              instruments are deployed at the Big Bear Solar Observatory, which is operated
              by the New Jersey Institute of Technology, the gathered data will be used to
              support research and thesis projects.  The scientific objective of these
              instruments is to resolve some of the fundamental length and time scales of
              solar magneto-convection.  Ultimately these intrinsic scales are related to the
              global aspects of solar variability and therefore to basic physical processes
              on the sun that affect the Earth environment, i.e., communications technology,
              the power grid, civil and military assets, humans in space, and in the end, the
              terrestrial climate.
