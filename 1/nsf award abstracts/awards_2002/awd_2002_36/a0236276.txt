Abstract    :
              Research over the past century has shown that where earthworms are abundant,
              they significantly influence soil processes critical to the functioning of
              terrestrial ecosystems. Recent interest has focused on impacts of invasive,
              exotic earthworms on soil processes, particularly in temperate regions.
              Dramatic effects of introduced earthworms on soil organic matter dynamics have
              been reported in a number of cases. The focus of nearly all of this work has
              been on a few species of exotic earthworms which have achieved wide
              distributions and now dominate the soil fauna in many ecosystems. Such effects
              have rarely been reported from invasions of ecosystems inhabited by native
              earthworm assemblages, particularly where soils are undisturbed. Objectives of
              this proposed work are to address the following questions:
1) Do native
              earthworm species maintain exclusivity or dominance over exotic earthworm
              species in undisturbed, native ecosystems? 
2) Are the impacts of exotic
              earthworm species on soil processes reduced in the presence of native earthworm
              species in their native ecosystems? 

Broader impacts: This work will promote
              training of a post-doctoral associate, a graduate student and several
              undergraduate students. Collaborations with regional and national museums will
              be developed to foster any new biological collections and to promote
              biodiversity information.
