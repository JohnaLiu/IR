This U.S.-Argentina award will support dissertation research
              of Mr. Lucio R. Malizia working under the direction of Dr. John G. Blake,
              University of Missouri.  Mr. Malizia will work with Dr. Alejandro D. Brown,
              Universidad Nacional de Tecuman, in Argentina, to conduct a study of the
              factors that control changes in tree-species composition across space (species
              turnover).  They will do this study in the Andes of northwestern Argentina. 
              This work will address a long-standing issue in ecology that  may have profound
              consequences for conservation and forest management.  Specifically, the study
              will shed light on the spatial structure of Argentina's diversity, and also has
              the potential to improve the network of Andean reserves through the
              identification of complementary areas that can maximize the number of protected
              tree species.
