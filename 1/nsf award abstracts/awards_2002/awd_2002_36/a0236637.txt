Abstract    :
              Penn State Erie's REU Program in Mathematical Biology will involve
              undergraduates in one of the richest and fastest growing fields of mathematics.
              It gives the six participants research training in mathematical biology and
              introduces them to several areas of current interest: population dynamics,
              pattern formation in active media, the modeling of electrically excitable
              cells, and limb growth of plants and trees. The only prerequisites are the
              successful completion of a course in ordinary differential equations and an
              interest in 
biology. The goal of the program is two-fold. First, the
              students receive an introduction to the theory and methods of nonlinear
              dynamical systems, including phase plane analysis and bifurcation theory. These
              techniques are then used to answer questions about mathematical models of
              biological phenomena. This is of great value since dynamical systems arise in
              many areas in addition to biology, such as physics, engineering, and chemistry.
              Second, the students are exposed to current topics of research in mathematical
              biology. Many of the topics discussed during the program are at the early
              stages of development, and offer many opportunities for future research.
              Students will have access to Pentium computers running the Linux operating
              system and will learn the mathematical software package XPP, a powerful tool
              for phase plane and bifurcation analysis. Seminars will be given throughout the
              program by both faculty and student 
participants along with discussion
              groups at the end of each day.
