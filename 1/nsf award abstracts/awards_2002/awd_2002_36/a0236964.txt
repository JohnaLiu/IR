Abstract    :
              The theory that the many different cell-types of the body are all derived from
              divisions of a single fertilized egg is well described, but poorly explained. 
              This remarkable transformation is thought to be the result of differential
              regulation of the activity of genes constituting an individual's genome.  The
              result is that each cell-type "expresses" its own array of genes required for
              their particular function in the body.  Decoding the "rules" that govern when
              and where a given gene will be activated or silenced is key to understanding
              the basis for organismal development.  Linked, non-coding DNA sequences are
              known to play a leading role in gene regulation.  Innumerable sequences capable
              of regulating gene expression have been identified.  However, the vast majority
              of such sequences do not function well in the natural "packaging environment"
              (called chromatin) in which genes normally reside.  More recently appreciated
              is the emerging role of the regulation of "chromatin states" in determining
              gene expression status.  However, the connection between regulatory DNA
              sequences and the alteration of chromatin states is still unclear.  Using
              highly integrated research and educational approaches, the proposed research
              project will investigate novel DNA sequences that appear to regulate gene
              expression via the alteration of chromatin structure.  Therefore, this work
              will help bridge the gap in the understanding of how chromatin is involved in
              gene regulation.  This will help bring the field closer to a more complete
              understanding of the development of complex organisms, such as ourselves.
