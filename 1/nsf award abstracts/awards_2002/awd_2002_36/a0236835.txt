Abstract    :
              A novel nano-device-a bipolar thin-film transistor (B-TFT) that is composed of
              nanocrystalline silicon (nano-Si)-will be investigated. This kind of device
              could open windows of opportunity for future nano-electronic and
              -optoelectronic devices and circuits on low-temperature substrates. We plan to
              carry out this research through the following steps: 1) to design the new
              transistor and fabrication processes, 2) to investigate advanced
              low-temperature PECVD processes for intrinsic, p-, and n-type nano-Si films for
              B-TFT, and 3) to fabricate and to characterize the complete nano-Si B-TFTs. The
              highest process temperature will be 250 C. We will explore the
              performance-limiting factors of B-TFT with respect to variations of the nano-Si
              properties. This project will include the PI, one graduate student, and one
              undergraduate student. Participating students will be exposed to
              interdisciplinary educational opportunity in nano-Si materials, low temperature
              transistor processes, and semiconductor characterization.
