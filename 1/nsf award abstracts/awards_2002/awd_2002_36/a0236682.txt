Abstract    :
              The Mt. Wilson Solar Photographic Digitization Project will make available to
              the community in digital form a selection of solar images in the archives of
              the Carnegie Observatories.  These images date from 1894 and include many which
              can be judged to be of superb quality by modern standards.  The digitization
              will use commercial scanning technology with a prepress scanner having 16-bit
              precision and up to 3000 by 3000 dots per inch spatial resolution.  These
              images will permit a variety of retrospective analyses of the state of solar
              magnetism and activity, and they will provide a temporal baseline of 100 years
              for numerous solar attributes.  The 20th Century was a period of increased
              anthropogenic production of greenhouse gases, which may contribute to global
              climate change.  The sun could also be a factor in global climate change.  The
              data provided by this digitization will allow the scientific community to
              freely examine the secular variation of the sun's magnetic behavior during this
              same time frame, and may thus be crucial in disentangling the solar and
              anthropogenic effects.
