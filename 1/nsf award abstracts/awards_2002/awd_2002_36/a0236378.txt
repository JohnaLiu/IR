This award supports the participation of American scientists
              in a U.S.-Australia workshop on quantum information science.  The organizers
              for the meeting are Professor Birgitta Whaley, University of California -
              Berkeley, Professor Paul Kwiat, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
              Professor Robert Clark, University of New South Wales, and Professor Gerard
              Milburn, University of Queensland.   The workshop will be held in Sydney
              Australia in January 2003.

This workshop will bring together solid-state and
              optical approaches to quantum information science, and explore opportunities
              both to advance research in the discipline, as well as to strengthen
              collaboration between researchers in Australia and the United States.  Most of
              the participants will be senior graduate students, postdoctoral researchers,
              and assistant professors, with the intent of fostering international linkages
              that can then be developed during the researchers' careers.
