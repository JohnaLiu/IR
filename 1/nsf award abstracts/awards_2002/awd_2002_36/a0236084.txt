Abstract    :
              
The foci of this research involve the preparation of of cyclopentadienones and
              the use of these compounds in cycloadditions and related processes.  Within
              this context the concept of antiaromaticity-driven reactions and retro-Nazarov
              chemistry will be explored.  An indanone synthesis, cyclopentadienone dimer
              photochemistry, the synthesis of eight-membered rings and the synthesis of
              polyenes will be carried out to develop and test the scope of the
              methodology.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program is supporting the research of Dr. Michael Harmata in the Department of
              Chemistry at the University of Missouri-Columbia.  Dr. Harmata will focus his
              work on developing synthetic methodology using cations and cycloaddition
              processes.  Starting with simple starting materials, complex molecules can be
              obtained in a quick and efficient manner.  There is potential for broader
              impact of the work in the areas of medicinal and materials chemistry.  The
              project also presents an excellent venue for the training of graduate
              students.
