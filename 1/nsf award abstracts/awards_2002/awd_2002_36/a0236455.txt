Funds from this grant will support an upgrade to a communal
              geophysics computer facility in the Department of Earth & Space Sciences at
              UCLA.   The current computing facility is based on an aging (vintage 1997)
              Solaris environment consisting of Sun Ultra and SPARC workstations.  A new
              multi-CPU SunBlade server, five SunBlade workstations and five PC workstations
              running Linux will augment this network and will serve eleven faculty members
              and their students.  An additional 2 TB RAID system will add significant
              additional storage capacity for analysis of massive seismic data holdings.  The
              University will provide funding for both a portion of the new equipment and
              also for an upgrade of the Ethernet connection in the Geology building to 1
              Gbit capacity.  A portion of this grant will also provide limited support for
              the salary of a computer systems administrator during the installation phase. 
              This upgraded facility will serve not only the startup needs of the lead PI,
              Emily Brodsky, for her theoretical models of explosive eruption dynamics, but
              also the needs of many other active faculty members including John Vidale,
              David Jackson, Heidi Houston , Paul Davis and John Aurnou, to name a few.  The
              increased computational speed and storage capacity of this compute facility
              will foster leading research in earthquake seismology, seismic tomography and
              geodynamics.  The proposal's broader impacts include both infrastructure
              development for multiple researchers and their students and the promotion of
              societally relevant earthquake mitigation efforts.
