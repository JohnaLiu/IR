This is an NSF CAREER/PECASE grant
              for research on the radiative properties of silicon at elevated temperatures.
              The principal investigator will conduct measurements of the directional
              radiative properties of Si wafers with polished and rough surfaces from room
              temperature up to 1000 C and from 0.4 to 20 micrometers. The theoretical part
              of the study will emphasize the effect of surface roughness on emittance and
              transmittance. The fundamental mechanisms, such as the temperature dependence
              of the carrier scattering rate and photon-enhanced absorption, will also be
              investigated.

The radiative properties of rough Si determined from this
              project will be used in a detailed heat transfer analysis to predict the
              emitted and reflected radiation from the wafer to the radiometer and the rapid
              thermal processing (RTP) chamber to optimize the RTP chamber design. In
              addition, an integrated educational plan is proposed to advance thermal science
              engineering education through the development of a microscale thermal science
              program and the writing of appropriate instructional and laboratory
              manuals.
