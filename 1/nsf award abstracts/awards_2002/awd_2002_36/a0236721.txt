This grant provides support for the acquisition of a 16
              processor cluster computer and related imaging  hardware and software
              facilitate modeling studies of two- and three-dimensional structure of the
              earth's lower mantle and inner core and studies of the fabric of solidifying
              basalt.  The increased processing power of the system will particularly aid in
              the seismic imaging of small scale (1-1000 km) heterogeneity of the earth. The 
              small-scale structural fabric of the Earth is important to the understanding of
              the formation of oceanic crust, mantle convection, slab cycling, plume
              formation, and solidification of the inner core. The small-scale fabric of the
              inner core controls deformation of the inner core boundary and its relation to
              the differential rotation of the inner core and mantle and the earth's magnetic
              field. New constraints on the small-scale structures enabled by the acquisition
              can also aid in determining the origin of the heterogeneous structure in the
              lower  mantle: remnant slabs, solid-solid phase transitions, pools of primitive
               mantle, partial melt, or core-mantle chemical reactions.
