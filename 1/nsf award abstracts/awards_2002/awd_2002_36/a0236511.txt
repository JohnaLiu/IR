Abstract    :
              The Center for Education of the National Academy of Sciences  proposes to
              develop a program of workshops to help the MSP awardees and future applicants
              improve K-16 STEM programs. The content of the workshops builds on recent  NRC
              reports (e.g., How People Lear; Adding it Up; Transforming Undergraduate
              Education in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology;  Knowing What
              Students Know; Learning and Understanding), and participants will have
              opportunities to examine the research and implementation issues identified in
              these reports in depth and apply them to their project designs.

It is
              anticipated that two workshops each on two different topics (making a total of
              four workshops) will be offered annually for three years. MSP grantees would be
              guaranteed slots in the workshops.

The workshops will be jointly developed
              by the Center for Education and the National Science Resources Center.
