This grant supports the acquisition of a new
              wavelength-dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (XRF) to be installed in
              the XRF laboratory at the University of Rhode Island (URI), Department of
              Geosciences.  The new instrument will replace the current non-functioning
              energy-dispersive system originally acquired in 1983.  Upgrades and support for
              the 1983 instrument are no longer available from the company, and finally, in
              the summer of 2001, a "blown" X-ray tube that could not be replaced sealed its
              fate.  The new state-of-the-art, wavelength-dispersive system will greatly
              improve the capabilities of our laboratory, including the ability to analyze
              for nearly all elements of geologic significance, at greatly improved
              sensitivities and accuracy.  The University has provided a renovated laboratory
              for the new XRF.  All sample preparation equipment, including crushers,
              grinders, fluxers, presses, etc. are in place as they were used with the 1983
              instrument.
	
Since 1983, the URI Geosciences XRF facility has served many
              scientists in the southern New England region, providing high-quality major and
              trace-element data for as many as one-hundred research projects.  The facility
              supported a wide variety of basic research, 30-40 graduate theses, innumerable
              undergraduate theses and research projects , and provided an ongoing, long-term
              model for vertically integrated learning at URI.  The URI Geosciences XRF
              facility not only enhances the research/education infrastructure of the
              university, but also provides a laboratory open to students and faculty at
              regional colleges and community colleges where sophisticated and expensive
              research laboratories are not available.  We also have partnered with museums,
              the state Crime Laboratory, and other groups, all of which have substantial
              numbers of women in their organizations.  The new equipment will permit the
              facility to continue to serve a diverse array of scientists and applications at
              URI as well as from the southern New England region.
