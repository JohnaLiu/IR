Abstract    :
              Bicarbonate (HCO3) dominates the dissolved inorganic carbon pool in the surface
              waters of the ocean. While some algal species can utilize HCO3 directly, the
              major source of inorganic carbon driving phytoplankton photosynthesis in the
              marine environment is CO2. Recent work indicates that the availability Of CO2
              is a potential limit on the growth of large marine diatoms. Diffusion of CO2
              across the cell membrane occurs directly in some phytoplankton species while
              others utilize a transporter for HCO?3 uptake, with the HCO3  converted to CO2
              by carbonic anhydrase (CA). Extracellular CA activity is found in some species
              while others have intracellular CA activity. Algal species such as diatoms
              are"CO2-users" and do not take up HC03 ions directly, requiring high ambient
              levels of CO2.  Conversely, other species such as haptophytes can proliferate
              under conditions of low CO2. This difference in carbon acquisition strategy
              suggests a mechanism whereby the composition of phytoplankton species within a
              community may be controlled by carbon limitation.  In general, diatoms are also
              poor producers of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and contain little or no
              DMSP?lyase. On the other hand, haptophytes are important producers of DMSP and
              have high DMSP lyase activity. The cellular function of DMSP and the lyase
              enzyme in algae is controversial. Breakdown of DMSP via the DMSP?lyase enzyme
              liberates dimethylsulfide (DMS), acrylic acid and protons. Dr. DiTullio
              hypothesizes that the release of protons via the lyase?mediated reaction allows
              those species with the DMSP?lyase enzyme to effectively utilize HCO3 under
              conditions of low CO2 by forcing the equilibria of the carbonate/bicarbonate
              system toward CO2. This allows these species to alleviate carbon limitation and
              dominate over non?DMSP?producing species in low CO2  
environments. This
              laboratory?based project will test the hypothesis that DMSP production in
              haptophytes is positively correlated to carbon limitation.
