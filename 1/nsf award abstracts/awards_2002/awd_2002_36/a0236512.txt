              Abstract.
Research at La Selva Biological Station in lowland Costa Rica 
              addresses several topical questions related to the importance of species in
              modifying or controlling the accumulation and cycling of carbon in lowland
              tropical rain forest. First, how variable are different tree species in their
              total productivity, aboveground:belowground allocation patterns, and biomass
              accumulation rates? Second, how do variations among species in tissue chemical
              composition alter the accumulation and decomposition of surface litter and fine
              roots. Third, how do differences in detritus production, tissue quality, and
              decay rates alter the accumulation and dynamics of soil organic matter? To
              address these questions, the Peje Plots at La Selva, which are 14-year-old,
              single-species tree plantations established will be utilized. Research findings
              will be integrated into current understanding of tropical rain forest carbon
              dynamics by applying the Century model.
Broader Impacts. This collaborative
              research among four scientists at two Institutions will include substantial
              involvement of Latin American scientists and students, in addition to
              supporting a full-time graduate student and numerous undergraduate assistants
              at Iowa State University. Preparing the next generation of scientists, both
              Costa Rican and American, is a fundamental goal of this research. The
              revitalized Peje Plots will provide a valuable long-term research facility for
              other investigators at La Selva, one of the world's preeminent tropical field
              stations, and will promote the long-range plan of La Selva.  Altogether, the
              results of this proposed research will enhance our mechanistic understanding of
              how individual species influence organic matter dynamics in tropical systems,
              will provide a demonstration of a sustainable land use alternative to pasture
              in the lowland tropics, and will allow for an improved capacity to model the 
              biogeochemistry of tropical lands in response to land use and environmental
              change.
