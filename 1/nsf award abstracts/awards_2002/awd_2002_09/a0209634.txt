The purpose of the workshop on "Genomics approaches to
              cis-element/TF interactions", to be held in Arlington Virginia on January
              16-17, 2002,  is to bring together scientists working on computational
              approaches with those who have taken more traditional approaches to the
              identification of cis-element/transcription factor interactions.  In the last
              twenty years, investigators have discovered regulatory sequences by studying
              the DNA binding characteristics of single proteins, or the cis elements that
              control the expression patterns of single genes.  This has led to the
              identification of binding sites for around 100 transcription factors.  These
              studies have greatly increased our knowledge of the nature of regulatory
              sequences, however, the analysis of recently completed genome sequences suggest
              that there are upwards of a thousand transcription factors in most eukaryotic
              organisms.  Thus, it is probable that whole families of DNA-binding proteins
              exist that have not yet been discovered.  This workshop will focus on advances
              being made in combining computational approaches with genome-wide sampling
              techniques to identify functional regulatory sequences. The goal is to exchange
              information on existing methodologies, with the hope that cross-disciplinary
              collaborations will be established and the seeds of new approaches will be
              sown.
