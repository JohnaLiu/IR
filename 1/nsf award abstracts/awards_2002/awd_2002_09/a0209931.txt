     The investigator and his colleagues develop
              numerical
methods for eigenvalue problems in infinite-dimensional spaces.
At
              the heart of the effort is the recently developed hybrid
diagonalization/Monte
              Carlo approach, which they feel has led to
significant advances in the
              computational treatment of the
general low energy eigenvalue problem.  They
              study the many
unresolved mathematical issues related to approximate methods
              for
low energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors in infinite-dimensional
spaces. 
              Among other things, the collaborators rigorously analyze
the accuracy of the
              diagonalization/Monte Carlo approach, study
the relation between eigenvalue
              distribution and eigenvector
structure, generalize the approach to
              non-Hermitian matrices, and
improve the computational treatment of clustered
              eigenvalues.  In
addition to studying the underlying mathematics,
              the
investigators also begin production on a public domain library
for
              infinite-dimensional eigenvalue problems.
     Eigenvalue problems play a
              crucial role in many diverse
branches of 21st-century science and engineering.
               This includes
for example the electronic properties of nanoscale structures
              and
new materials; the interactions of protons and neutrons in heavy
nuclei;
              and gene similarity database studies in bioinformatics.
The eigenvalue problem
              consists of finding certain attributes of
a given square matrix, M. 
              Specifically one is seeking column
vectors, v, such that M times v is again
              proportional to v.  The
proportionality constant is called an eigenvalue of M
              and v is
the corresponding eigenvector.  In this project
              computational
experts in computer science, applied mathematics, and
              physics
collaborate to investigate large-dimensional matrix
              eigenvalue
problems.  The collaborators study the underlying
              mathematical
issues related to this problem and develop a public
              domain
library that can be applied to matrices of infinite dimension.
The
              extension to infinite dimensions is crucial for many
applications,
              particularly those in quantum physics and
chemistry, but the existence of this
              library will impact many
other areas that feature large-dimensional eigenvalue
              problems
and are currently intractable with existing methods.
