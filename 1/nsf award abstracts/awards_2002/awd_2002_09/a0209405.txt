Abstract    :
                 The Society for Research on Biological Rhythms is now the largest society in
              the world 
for those interested in biological rhythms, and this award supports
              their biannual 
meeting.   Biological rhythms are an important feature of life
              on this planet, and so the 
topic has major importance, and there have been
              rapid recent advances in 
understanding underlying mechanisms of rhythmic
              biological activity.   
   The conference is highly interdisciplinary in the
              approaches discussed, including 
molecular biology, physiology and behavior,
              computational neuroscience and 
neuroendocrinology, and in topics spanning
              subsecond oscillations in motor systems, 
intertidal rhythms in invertebrates,
              reproductive cycles, human sleep and shift-work 
schedules.  The format is an
              excellent combination of lectures, workshops, and poster 
sessions,
              emphasizing interactions between workers from different fields, and women 
are
              well represented, along with the international community.  The biannual timing
              allows 
a good perspective, and this year will cover some of the most exciting
              current issues, 
such as the recent discovery of a link between the circadian
              clock gene Per (from the 
fruitfly) and a genetically controlled sleep pattern
              in humans.  
     The potential impact of this conference is high in the
              fields of neuroendocrinology and 
behavioral neuroscience, because of the
              focused discussions shaping future work, the 
potential to develop new
              cross-disciplinary collaborations, and the likely interactions and
              
introductions essential to career development of young investigators. Funding
              from NSF 
will be important to help students, postdocs, and young researchers
              without access to 
other funding to attend the conference.
