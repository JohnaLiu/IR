Abstract    :
              The Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division makes this award to
              Connecticut College to develop non-aqueous routes for the synthesis of
              microporous manganese oxides with layered and tunneled structures using sol-gel
              and colloid precursors.  With this award, Professor Ching will prepare
              manganese oxide thin films and aerogels using non-aqueous sol-gel reactions
              between tetraalkylammonium permanganates and methanol.  High surface area
              aerogels will be prepared without the solvent exchange steps needed with
              aqueous gels. In addition, these layered and tunneled materials will
              accommodate a wide range of interstitial cations.  The growth of manganese
              oxide particles in colloidal and sol-gel environments will be studied in terms
              of their size distribution using dynamic light scattering under a number of
              reaction conditions such as time, temperature, concentration, reactant ratio,
              and mechanical agitation.  These studies in concert with other proposed
              characterization techniques will be used to establish procedures to prepare
              manganese oxides with predetermined properties such as crystallinity, particle
              size, and morphology. 

Manganese oxide thin films and aerogels that will be
              prepared in this study are expected to have high surface area, and will
              accommodate a wide range of interstitial cations for potential applications in
              catalysis and lithium ion rechargeable batteries.  The proposed studies, in
              addition,  will provide undergraduate students with comprehensive hands-on
              experience in research, and the project has the potential to attract more
              students to careers in science.
