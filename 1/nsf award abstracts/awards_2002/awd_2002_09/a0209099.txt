Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to design and analyze discrete
              algorithms
approximating solutions to combinatorial optimization
              problems.Because
many of these problems are NP-hard,an exact solution is often
              not feasible;
in such cases approximation algorithms are a viable
              alternative.In addition
to attacking approximation problems that seem to
              require new strategies,
another main goal is to investigate the applicability
              of design principles de-
veloped successfully for traditional discrete
              optimization problems to com-
parable tasks occurring in other areas.In any
              ase,a rigorous performance
analysis is always intended.
A .rst focus is the
              #P-complete permanent problem,which is of much
importance in statistical
              physics and combinatorics.Rough approximations
(up to an exponential
              factor)can be obtained in deterministic polynomial
time and possibly even mu h
              faster on a parallel machine.Such a solution
would allow to solve the
              outstanding bipartite matching problem of parallel
computing.Even though the
              matching problem is easy for a sequential
machine,it is very hallenging to
              coordinate the many processors of a parallel
machine to worksimultaneously and
              e .ciently on the same matching.It is
also proposed to attackthe parallel
              matching problem with a novel version
of more traditional network .ow
              methods.
Another theme of this proposal is the approximation of NP-hard
              opti-
mization problems by traditional methods like lo al search,the
              comparison
method,semide .nite optimization,or some combination of these.It is
              even
proposed to investigate the approximation of some problems in P,as
              this
could have interesting applications in parallel computing.
