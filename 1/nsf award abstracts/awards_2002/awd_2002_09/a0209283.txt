Abstract    :
              This award subsidizes expenses of student participants in the Student Research
              Workshop organized in conjunction with the 2002 Association for Computational
              Linguistics Conference, to be held July 7-12 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The
              Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the primary international
              organization in the field of natural language processing and language
              engineering, with two regional chapters, Europe (EACL) and North America
              (NAACL), of approximately equal size. The Association's annual conference,
              which rotates between North America and Europe, is the major international
              meeting in the field. The workshop format allows students to present their
              research and receive feedback from a panel of established researchers in the
              field. It will provide students with invaluable exposure to outside
              perspectives on their work at a critical time in their professional
              development, through feedback from the panel and other student participants.
              The ACL Student Workshop is an inexpensive yet highly effective means of
              encouraging young and upcoming computational linguists. The intimate format
              encourages the student participants to begin building a rapport with
              established researchers. This nurturing effort should pay dividends by more
              effectively guiding students in this rapidly changing research field. In
              addition, by building a supportive environment for these students, it is more
              likely that down the road they will in turn lend a supporting hand to other
              students who follow. 

Computational lingustics is a multidisciplinary field
              of increasing importance to science, commerce, and society.  This workshop
              contributes to the professional development of young scientists who will lead
              this growing field in the coming decades.
