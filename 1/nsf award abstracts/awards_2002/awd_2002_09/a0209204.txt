Abstract    :
              An ad hoc network is a group of mobile computers (or nodes) using wireless
              network interfaces, in which individual nodes cooperate by forwarding packets
              for each other to allow nodes to communicate beyond their direct wireless
              transmission ranges.  This project is attempting to create a routing protocol
              for ad hoc networks that is highly robust against attacks, yet is able to
              perform close to the best existing non-secure ad hoc network routing
              protocols.

The research focuses primarily on on-demand (or reactive) routing
              protocols, in which a node attempts to discover a route to some destination
              only when it has a packet to send to that destination, but also considers how
              the routing security techniques developed apply to other styles of ad hoc
              network routing protocols such as periodic (or proactive) and hybrid protocols.
               The research addresses passive and active attackers, including cooperating
              attacking nodes and compromised nodes.  The types of attacks considered range
              from routing disruption attacks, in which an attacker attempts to cause
              legitimate data packets to be routed in dysfunctional ways, to resource
              consumption attacks, in which an attacker injects packets into the network in
              an attempt to consume valuable network resources such as bandwidth, or to
              consume node resources such as memory (storage) or computation power.
