Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this research is to produce practical codes that
              provide
unequaled robustness, approaching the performance predicted by
              compound
channel information theory for linear Gaussian channels.  The
              resulting
channel codes will find application in many scenarios including
              wired and
wireless broadcast, wireless local area networks, asymmetric
              digital
subscriber lines, military anti-jam communications, and frequency
              hopped
communications.

Results from compound channel information theory
              state that a single code
exists that supports communication over every channel
              that has a mutual
information above the information rate of the code.  Thus,
              once the
transmitter power spectrum is fixed, a code need not be specialized
              to a
particular frequency selective channel in a single antenna system or
              a
particular space-time path-gain matrix in a multiple antenna system. 
              While
this theoretical result is more that thirty years old, practical code
              design
has focused to date on a weaker notion of robustness, that of
              average
performance according to a statistical channel model, such as
              Rayleigh
fading.  The power of the code design approach taken in
              this
research is that the code design is independent of statistical
              assumptions
about the channel.  The code simply works on every channel that it
              possibly
could.

A second goal of this research is to develop codes that
              support multiple
rates to different users.  Here again, information theory
              (this time
information theory for degraded broadcast channels) lays out the
              limits of
performance.  Our research will closely approach these performance
              limits by
applying turbo codes to the concept of superposition coding for the
              degraded
broadcast channel.
