Description:  This project supports a U.S.-Morocco
              workshop on information technology to be held in Rabat, Morocco June 2002.  The
              U.S. organizer is Dr. Abdelghani Bellaachia, Professor in the Department of
              Computer Science, George Washington University, Washington, D.C.  The Moroccan
              co-organizer is Dr. Said Belcadi, Director, Scientific Research and Cooperation
              (CNCPRST), Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, Rabat,
              Morocco. The workshop will cover topics in the following areas: bioinformatics,
              e-commerce, internet/networking, software engineering,
              telecomputing/telemedicine, and wireless communications.  It is hoped that the
              presentations and discussions will lead to identifications of areas of
              cooperative research of mutual interest to the two countries.

Scope:  This
              project will likely open avenues for collaboration in information technology
              research, an important area for the United States and for many of the
              developing countries, such as Morocco, where there is a need to accelerate the
              development in that area and to reap benefits in many applications such as in
              education, communications and in industrialization.  The U.S. team that Dr.
              Bellaachia has assembled is composed of eminent and experienced scientists. The
              Government of Morocco has strongly endorsed the workshop.  Funding for the
              project is provided by the Office of International Science and Engineering and
              the Division of Advanced Networking Infrastructure and Research.
