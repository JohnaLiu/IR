Abstract:

Some impact of topology on variational
              problems

In this project, we will focus on variational problems involving
              vector- 
valued maps. In particular, we will study upper and lower bounds
              of
the energy functional for maps with suitable topological information,
the
              weak sequential approximation of Sobolev maps by smooth maps and
the structure
              of singular sets for solutions of some variational
problems. Various tools
              from geometric measure theory and differential
and algebraic topology are used
              in handling these issues. On the other
hand, our approach to the problems
              sheds light on new relations among
these topics.

Variational problems
              involving vector-valued maps appear naturally in 
analysis, geometry and
              physics. Besides their mathematical interests and 
importance, they are
              crucial to various models in mathematical physics. 
Typical examples include
              models for superconductivity, magnetic material 
and liquid crystals. The
              research in this area will lead to better 
understanding of certain type of
              physics phenomenon as well as new 
impetus in mathematics in this
              direction.
