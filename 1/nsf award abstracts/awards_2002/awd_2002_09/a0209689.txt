Abstract    :
              This grant provides support for the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on CO2
              FIXATION & METABOLISM IN GREEN PLANTSlI to be held at Mount Holyoke College on
              August 11 th -16 th , 2002, four days after the Plant Biology 2002 meeting in
              Denver. This international GRC regularly takes place on a triennial basis,
              alternating between sites in the US and Western Europe. Its specific focus on
              extensive, forward-thinking discussion is not duplicated by any other
              plant-related conference. The internationally recognized organizing committee,
              comprised of Drs. Raymond Chollet (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) and
              Christine Foyer (IACR-Rothamsted, UK) as the elected Co-Chairs and Drs. George
              Bowes (University of Florida) and Susanne von Caemmerer (Australian
              NationalUniversity) as the elected Co-Vice-Chairs, has developed and finalized
              a timely, exciting program consisting of nine informal sessions and four
              contributed poster sessions.  Consistent with recent trends in this GRC and
              this field's advancing basic science, the former sessions will be both
              integrative and rather wide-ranging under the general theme of photosynthetic
              CO2-fixation and metabolism in plants, including [1] Photosynthesis in the
              Ecosystem, [2, 3] CO2-Assimilating Enzymes & Their Regulation, [4]
              CO2-Concentrating Mechanisms, [5] Starch and Sucrose Metabolism, [6] C- and
              N-Signaling, [8] Chloroplast-Mitochondrial Interactions, and [9] a featured,
              after-banquet presentation on the emerging role of the chloroplast and
              photosynthesis in secondary metabolism in green plants. In addition, one entire
              session [7] will be devoted to early-career scientists and/or late-breaking,
              hot-off-the-press results selected from among the poster presentations and/or
              very recent literature. Along these lines, the critical, singular goal of this
              grant is to provide partial, fixed-fee and/or travel support to 12
              early-career, US plant scientists, including graduate and advanced
              undergraduate students; postdoctoral research associates; and unfunded,
              beginning PIs. The participation of these junior US scientists will not only be
              of immense professional benefit and encouragement to them, but also to the
              dynamic, cutting-edge nature of a GRC, the success of Session 7, and to future
              exciting advances in this active field of experimental plant biology.
