Title: CAM 2002: Conference on Applied
              Mathematics

CAM 2002, a conference on applied mathematics, will be held on
              the University of Central Oklahoma campus on the weekend of October 25 - 27,
              2002. The conference will focus on two related areas within applied mathematics
              with applications to telecommunications, and electrical and computer
              engineering: wavelets/signal processing and error-correcting codes. As a
              result, this conference will be of interest to engineers and physicists as well
              as to mathematicians. A major emphasis of the conference will be "coding
              theory": Much of signal processing is about source coding while the theory of
              error-correcting codes is channel coding. Wavelets are now the most applicable
              tool in signal processing. For instance, wavelet filters were recently adopted
              as the JPEG-2000 image compression standard. Wavelet packets, a mathematical
              shorthand for compressing and restoring virtually any image or sound, have been
              used by the FBI and Scotland Yard to compress their fingerprint files to a more
              manageable size. 

CAM 2002 will foster interdisciplinary communication
              between mathematicians, computer engineers, and signal processors; i.e., this
              conference will bring together theoreticians and practitioners. Moreover, the
              conference will provide an opportunity for students (undergraduate & graduate)
              and faculty from the region to share their research with each other and
              interact with world-class experts in the areas of wavelets/signal processing
              and error-correcting codes. Error-correcting codes provide the means for the
              reliable transformation of speech, audio, images and video into digital
              content. Deep space communication, wireless phones, high speed data networks,
              the Internet, and products like compact disc players, hard drives, and high
              speed modems make essential use of coding and data compression to improve speed
              and reliability. The federal funds will be used primarily to provide travel
              support for students, recent doctoral recipients, junior faculty, women and
              other underrepresented groups in mathematics, science and
              engineering.
