Abstract    :
              This award provide partial support for the 2002 Gordon Research Conference on
              Laser Interactions with Materials to be held at Proctor Academy in Andover, New
              Hampshire on July 21-26, 2002. The primary goal of the conference is to bring
              together investigators from diverse disciplines studying a wide variety of
              materials systems to share their approaches and progress in unraveling basic
              mechanisms and applications that arise from laser/material interactions.
              

The purpose of this conference is to focus on current state-of-the-art and
              necessary future directions for the field where interactions between all
              participants is facilitated by several key presentations by a leading scientist
              in the area. Topics of high current interest include applications to life
              sciences and medicine; laser processing applicable to nanotechnology,
              optoelectronics, and future electronics systems; and applications of ultrafast
              lasers. The program will emphasize participation of a diverse group of
              participants, including women, minorities, and young investigators
