Abstract    :
              This is an RUI award for research at a predominantly undergraduate institution. 
              Numerical and analytical approaches will be used to study spin transport in
              paramagnetic quantum fluids and solids.  The research consists of three
              projects: analysis of transverse relaxation in NMR experiments with highly
              polarized Fermi liquids; computer simulation of spin waves and spin diffusion
              in Heisenberg paramagnets; and, calculation of the damping rates of slosh modes
              in trapped Fermi gases.

Undergraduate research is an integral part of the
              Computational Physics program at Wisconsin - La Crosse.  Hence, students play
              an important role in this research, including the presentation of results at
              national conferences and undergraduate research forums.
