This is a
              collaborative research effort between UC San Diego and UC Santa Barbara to
              carry out experimental and computational study of gravity currents and
              two-layer bores in fluids of large density difference so that the usual
              Boussinesq approximation cannot be applied.  The non-Boussinesq cases are found
              in many industrial flows and some chloride solutions for the low-density
              contrast experiments and sodium chloride solutions for the high-density
              contrast cases.  Gross features of the flow will be recorded by shadowgraphs,
              and detailed velocity measurements will be made by particle tracing technique. 
              Direct numerical simulations (DNS) willb e made for these cases at UCSB.  From
              the understanding gained by the experimental and computational studies, models
              of propagation and the mixing of the currents will be formulated.
