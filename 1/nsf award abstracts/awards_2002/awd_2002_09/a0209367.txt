Abstract    :
              The project provides funds for a block travel grant for U.S. sociologists to
              attend the XVth World Congress of the International Sociological Association in
              Brisbane, Australia, July 7-13, 2002.  The major conference of the
              International Sociological Association, the World Congress occurs at four-year
              intervals and attracts approximately 5,000 participants.  Support for travel 
              of U.S. sociologists permits continued growth of international exchange and
              collaboration in sociology.  An activity of this type is particularly timely
              given the necessity to promote international collaborations on challenges
              arising from global social processes and transformations, including those
              stemming from global interconnectedness, the new technolgies associated with
              the internet, and the growing hybridization of cultures.  Evaluation  of
              indiviudal requests for travel awards, selection of recipients, and  the
              distriubtion of funds will be the responsibility of the American Sociological
              Association.  Competitive criteria for an award include an iinvitation or
              acceptance of a paper, the scientific merit of the paper,  and qualifications
              of the applicant.  The selection process will seek to ensure a presence at the
              World Congress of junior scholars and sociologists underrepresented in
              international scholarly meetings.
