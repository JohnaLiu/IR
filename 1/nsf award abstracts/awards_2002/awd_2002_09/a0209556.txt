Abstract    :
              This project was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering
              initiative, NSF 01-157, category NER. The objective of this project is to
              develop a novel low cost nano-lithography technique. Conventional
              nano-manufacturing equipment, using electron beams or other radiation sources
              and operating in vacuum, costs well above $1,000,000. In contrary, this
              technique is based on a laser device and its accessories; its total cost will
              be less than $100,000. The key component in this nano-lithography system is a
              nanometric optical antenna capable of transmitting an incoming micrometer size
              laser beam into a nanometer size domain with high transmissivity (efficiency).
              This nano-lithography system can be further developed into a parallel
              manufacturing system, so that the time needed for the manufacturing process can
              be significantly reduced compared with other techniques. 

With the rapid
              progress in nano-technology, it is crucial to develop low cost manufacturing
              techniques with high throughput. Only with rapid and low cost manufacturing
              techniques could the nano-technology translate itself from research to
              industry, and to impact the society. The success of this work will provide a
              low cost nano-lithography technique for nano-manufacturing. This research will
              also provide training to undergraduate and graduate students, including
              underrepresented groups. The results of this research will be broadly
              disseminated.
