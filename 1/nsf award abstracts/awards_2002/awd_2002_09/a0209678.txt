Abstract    :
              This research project is funded in response to the Nanoscale Science and
              Engineering Initiative, NSF 01-157, category NIRT.  Nanorobotics is concerned
              with (1) manipulation of nanoscale objects by using micro or macro devices, and
              (2) construction, control and programming of robots with overall dimensions at
              the nanoscale (or with microscopic dimensions but nanoscopic components). This
              project covers both of these aspects, because both are important:
              nanomanipulation is the most effective process developed until now for
              prototyping of nanosystems, and nanorobots with dimensions comparable to those
              of biological cells are expected to have revolutionary applications in
              environmental monitoring and health care-for example, in the early detection
              and destruction of pathogens. The initial research will be biased towards
              manipulation, with a focus on the automation of techniques developed in
              previous NSF grants for  reliable and accurate nanomanipulation by using the
              tip of a Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM) as a sensory robot.  Work on nanorobot
              construction will begin at a low level but increase as the project evolves. It
              will integrate research on sensors, actuators, control, power, communications,
              and interfacing across spatial scales and between organic/inorganic as well as
              biotic/abiotic systems. 

The theoretical and experimental results of this
              work will contribute to the understanding of robotics in domains with large
              spatial uncertainties, and to the development of NEMS (Nanoelectromechanical
              Systems). The software will be widely distributed and will be very useful to
              scientists and engineers working in nanomanipulation and nanolithography.  The 
              project will involve students at all levels, from postdocs to minority
              high-school students, who will be exposed to this new and interdisciplinary
              field. The research will be further coupled to education through conference
              tutorials and new, regular university courses. For example, a graduate course
              in nanorobotics offered in the Spring semester of 2002 will evolve by
              incorporating the research findings of the project, and a tutorial based on the
              course will be offered at the 2002 IEEE conference on nanotechnology.
