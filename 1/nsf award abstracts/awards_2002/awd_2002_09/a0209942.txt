Abstract    :
                  The investigator studies the dynamics of certain classes
              of
integro-differential equations that arise in models of cortex. 
              He
examines how recurrent activity terminates due to any of several
effects
              such as synaptic depression, depolarization block,
              and
after-hyperpolarization.  He also considers how recurrent
connections
              lead to bistability and under what conditions this is
sufficient to produce
              localized spatial states, wave fronts, and
pulses.  He uses methods of
              averaging and bifurcation theory to
derive and analyse simplified dynamics
              from these models.  The
mathematical results explain a variety of experimental
              findings
in both normal and pharmacologically manipulated neural
              tissue.
These methods are applied to the Limax procerebral lobe, the
turtle
              olfactory bulb, and various cortical slice preparations.
     Neurons, the
              main cells in the brain, are responsible for
processing inputs from the
              outside world and converting this to
motor actions.  They communicate by
              producing spikes that are
propagated to different regions of the brain by
              chemicals called
transmitters.  The nvestigator is interested in how
              this
electrical and chemical information moves from one part of the
brain to
              others.  He uses simulations and mathematics to derive
equations and general
              principles about how this is done.
Experiments have shown that during some
              cognitive tasks, certain
groups of neurons fire synchronously.  He is
              interested in the
conditions that are necessary to attain precise timing
              between
different groups of neurons.  In order to study these, he
              has
developed mathematical software for the study of complex
biological and
              physical systems.  As part of this project, he
continues to develop this
              software and to make it widely
available.  The project also provides
              interdisciplinary training
opportunities for students and postdocs.
