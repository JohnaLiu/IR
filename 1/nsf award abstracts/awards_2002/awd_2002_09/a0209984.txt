Abstract    :
              Tourism is a major industry in the world, and poorer countries have invested
              resources in developing tourist attractions to showcase their natural
              environment to wealthy tourists. This dissertation research proposal by a
              cultural anthropology student investigates the impact of one such project in
              Huatulco, Oaxaca, Mexico, on the lives of local residents. The study will
              investigate three broad questions: how the direction of public resources to the
              tourist infrastructure affects local residents' perceptions of the resources
              available to them; how the redirection of resources towards tourism development
              and the growing tourist presence has changed the actual and expected standard
              of living for local residents; and how emigration is perceived by local
              residents as a strategy to accommodate expectations of higher living standards
              that may have been thwarted by tourism development.  The methods include
              participant observation, semi-structured interviews, the analysis of social
              networks, and the collection of household histories. Aside from contributing to
              the education of a young social scientists, this research will advance our
              understanding of the sources of Mexican migration to the US, and the social as
              well as economic costs and benefits of tourism development.
