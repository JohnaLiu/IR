Abstract    :
              This project is fundamental research to improve the performance of intelligent
              software agents, based on the observation that an agent's past experiences are
              a valuable and generally underutilized database.  The goal is to produce
              algorithms that make stronger use of data than existing reinforcement learning
              algorithms, enabling a view of the agent's stored experiences as a repository
              that can be mined for performance-improving information.  More generally, the
              agent may choose to use data obtained by observing other agents, or even from
              mining the web.

The impact of this research may be felt in many areas.  For
              example, software learning agents can be expected to learn in a much more
              human-like manner; noteworthy experiences will be remembered, and their
              influence on future performance will not attenuate.  There will be no sampling
              requirements on the data, so it will be possible to learn from watching others
              and possible to use repositories of stored data to learn new behaviors.  Among
              the likely practical applications of this work are network management and
              electronic commerce.
