Abstract    :
              This research addresses an important set of questions arising
in optimization
              of industrial systems for network design,
data classification, facility
              location, and scheduling.
A fundamental problem arising in all these areas is
              called
set covering.  Set covering problems range from easy to very
difficult
              and it is the more difficult ones that form the focus
of this research.  The
              problems studied are approached through
rigorous and mathematical
              methods.

This research studies several approaches to the design
              of
algorithms for set covering problems arising in the areas of
network
              design, facility location and data classification, mostly
based on
              mathematical programming techniques.  The focus
is on the study of complexity
              and approximability of set covering
and its extensions in network design and
              classification, including the
design of general algorithmic techniques and the
              analysis of
mathematical programming formulations and relaxations.  A
              special
emphasis is made on set covering problems defined on directed
graphs,
              which is an area where very few results are available in
the literature.
