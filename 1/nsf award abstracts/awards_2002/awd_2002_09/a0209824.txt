Abstract    :
                   The long term goal of this project is to develop a dynamical
theory of how
              neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) generate a
tuned response to multiple
              (rather than single) features of a
visual stimulus, and how these responses
              are spatially integrated
across the cortex to generate more global information
              about a
visual scene.  A primary focus of the work is to extend
              current
network models of orientation tuning to incorporate the fact that
V1
              cells are also selective for spatial frequency.  This is
motivated by the
              considerable physiological and psychophysical
evidence suggesting that
              cortical circuits carry out a localized
two-dimensional Fourier decomposition
              of a stimulus rather than
simply performing local edge detection.  Optical
              imaging of the
surface of cortex has revealed an intricate relationship
              between
the distribution of orientation and spatial frequency
              preferences
across cortex.  How correlations between these two
              feature
preference maps is manifested by the local and long-range
circuitry
              of V1, and the consequences for the large-scale
dynamics of V1 is also
              investigated.
     The primary visual cortex (V1) located at the back of
              the
brain is the first cortical area to process visual information
received
              from the eyes.  One of the classical results regarding
the function of neurons
              (brain cells) in V1 is that they analyze
very local features of a visual
              image, that is, they carry out
image decomposition. (For example, V1 cells are
              sensitive to the
orientation of an edge representing the boundary between a
              light
and dark region of the image.  This discovery by Hubel and Wiesel
led
              to the Nobel prize in medicine).  A very important question
that follows from
              this is how our coherent perception of the
world is reconstructed.  Until
              recently, it was thought that the
local information from cells in V1 was
              passed through higher
order processing stages in the brain where cognition
              occurs.
However, it is becoming clear that long-range circuitry within
              V1
could itself contribute to the process of reconstruction.  The
basic aim
              of the proposal is to investigate this process by
developing a large-scale
              mathematical model of primary visual
cortex that incorporates the latest
              anatomical data regarding its
internal circuitry.  Understanding how early
              stages in the visual
brain encode images has important applications to
              information
technology (such as the development of artificial vision
              systems)
and biotechnology (such as the development of an
              artificial
prosthesis for the visually impaired).  In the latter case
              it
might be possible one day to artificially stimulate primary
visual cortex
              to induce a visual sensation, rather like a
controlled visual
              hallucination.
