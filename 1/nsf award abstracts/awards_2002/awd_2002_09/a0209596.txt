Abstract    :
              This award supports partially the participation by 15 American researchers in
              the 7th International Conference on Inorganic Membranes to be held in Dalien,
              China, 23-26 June, 2002.  This conference provides a unique forum for dialog
              among international researchers in the field.   It will bring together about
              300 researchers from 35 countries.  Both academic and industrial researchers
              will participate in sessions on synthesis and characterization of membranes and
              applications relating to separation processes, membrane reactors, and
              environmental protection.

Inorganic membranes offer unique advantages in
              separation processes and reactors because of their stability and durability,
              and the current research activity is dynamic, stimulated by new developments in
              materials synthesis, molecular modeling, and specific applications.  Much of
              the important new work is being done abroad, so it is vital that U.S.
              researchers maintain contact and collaboration with their foreign counterparts.
               This conference provides an opportunity to promote such contact.
