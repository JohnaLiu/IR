This proposal was received in response to the Nanoscale
              Science and Engineering initiative NSF 01-157, category NER, and is co-funded
              by the GEO and ENG Directorates. The collaborative team states that while it is
              generally held that inter- and intra-molecular forces ultimately govern the
              interactions between biomolecules and inorganic surfaces, it is difficult to
              gain an appreciation of these forces because they exist at a seemingly
              infinitesimal magnitude.  The central aim of this proposal is to begin to
              bridge this gap by using force microscopy to discover and explore the nanoscale
              forces at the interface between bacterially produced proteins and mineral
              surfaces or other inorganic phases.  Force measurements will provide a
              quantitative measure of the natural affinity between nanoscale biomolecules and
              inorganic surfaces.  These force data will be used to design a
              soft-lithographic technique in which a bacterium is used as a living "pen" that
              produces and secretes various proteins as nanoscale patterns onto a solid
              surface.
