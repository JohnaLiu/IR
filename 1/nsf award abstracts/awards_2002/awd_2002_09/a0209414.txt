Abstract

Proposal Number 	CTS-0209414
Principal Investigator	Shinbrot,
              Glasser, and Storm
Affiliation	Rutgers U
Title	Gordon Research Conference on
              Granular and Granular-Fluid Flows


The Proposal is seeking support for the
              first Gordon Research Conference on Granular and Granular-Fluid Flows, planned
              for June 30 - July 5, 2002.  Granular flow is an integral part of many
              industrial and technological processes including composites and pharmaceuticals
              to materials processing and semiconductor manufacturing. The conference is
              organized to focus on recent developments and emerging areas of research as
              well as discussion of the open questions in the field.  Also, the conference
              promotes collaborations between various disciplines which overlap with the
              subject area of the conference.
