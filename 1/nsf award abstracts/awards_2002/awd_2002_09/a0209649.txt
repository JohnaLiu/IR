The proposal requests support for 6 U.S.
              participants to a 3-day workshop to be held in Seoul, Korea. This U.S.-Korea
              Joint Workshop is about the coastal ocean prediction/forcasting for the Korea
              Strait and the East/Japan Sea (KSES). The workshop will review the current
              knowledge of the oceanography of the KSES, formulate recommendations for
              developing coastal model(s) with real-time capacity, and explore opportunities
              for new collaboration between the US and Korea scientists.
