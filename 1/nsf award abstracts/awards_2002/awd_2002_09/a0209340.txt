Abstract    :
              Dev Thirumalai is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational
              Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division and the Molecular Biophysics
              Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences to continue work
              on protein folding and protein dynamics.  This work is characterized by the
              development of algorithms and theories to interpret various topics, such as the
              force-induced unfolding of proteins and the assembly of beta-hairpin
              structures.  These concepts and methods are used to make precise predictions
              that can be tested in experiments.  This current project focuses on three
              areas:  1) obtaining a greater understanding of elementary processes in protein
              folding, such as loop formation and beta-hairpin formation; 2) investigating
              the mechanism of urea-induced denaturation; and 3) studying the
              chaperone-assisted folding of proteins.  Much of this work relies on
              statistical mechanics and simulations that have been used for the studies of
              glasses.

In this project there is a close connection between Thirumalai's
              theoretical and computational studies and recent experimental work, a
              connection that is often missing in similar computational investigations.  The
              theoretical approach used here will provide a basic understanding of the
              folding properties of proteins, such as why a particular amino acid sequence
              adopts a particular folded conformation.  Such problems are currently at the
              frontier of protein research, and a basic understanding of the factors that
              influence protein folding could have an enormous impact on the biotechnology
              industry.
