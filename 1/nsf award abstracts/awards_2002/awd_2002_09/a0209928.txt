Title:	GOALI - Gas Holdup in
              Flocculating Slurries

The effect of fiber geometry and mass fraction on gas
              holdup in gas-liquid-fiber slurries will be investigated by the PI at Iowa
              State University and the PI at Kimberly-Clark Corporation.  The most direct
              application of the results is to fiber de-inking and fiber bleaching in fiber
              floatation columns used in many pulp and paper producing companies.  Previous
              results from independent investigation of the PIs have shown interesting
              behavior when fiber is added to a gas-liquid column.  The gas holdup in the
              slurry can be significantly different with the presence of fiber.   The
              proposal study will investigate the various aspects of this problem including
              the effect of fiber entanglement on gas holdup.
