Abstract    :
              Models are the foundations of science and engineering.  Well known examples of
              models can be found in physics, geology, economy, astronomy, weather
              forecasting, etc.  It is important that for each application the correct model
              is used. Indeed, the progress of science relies on finding models that describe
              accurately the main features of the application. Frequently models must be
              radically adjusted to take into account new technological developments or to
              make the models more accurate.

Most models used in trusted systems are over
              20 years old, that is before the introduction of the internet, computer
              viruses, the World Wide Web, hacking, denial of service attacks, poorly tested
              operating systems, etc. Since computer systems changed dramatically during this
              period, the models used for computer security are outdated and often
              unrealistic.  There is a need to start a process of analyzing whether some of
              the earlier models are still appropriate, and if not, adapt them.  If one does
              not address this issue the gap between reality and research is going to widen,
              making research in this area irrelevant.

The goals are:
- to critically
              analyze existing models for trusted systems,
- to propose new models using
              techniques from such disciplines as computational complexity, discrete
              mathematics, and economics.
- to compare these models and evaluate them.
