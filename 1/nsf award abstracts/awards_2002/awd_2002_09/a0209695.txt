ABSTRACT

The proposed research concerns the numerical solution
of
              sparse optimal control problems. The research issues
originate from the Boeing
              Company's software project
SOCS (Sparse Optimal Control Software). 
              The
constraints in the control problems are represented by
systems of
              differential algebraic equations (DAEs), a
class of differential equations
              whose solution poses
serious challenges. The PIs propose to advance
              the
state-of-the-art in high-index DAE technology to solve
realistic,
              large-scale applications; to increase
software scalability through the use of
              interior point
methods for non-linear solvers and Krylov-space methods
for
              linear solvers; and to develop prototyping software
to test accuracy and
              performance of new algorithms.

Research will be conducted on improving
              software for
difficult, complex problems in aerospace and
              mechanical
engineering applications, such as design of flight
control
              systems, robot arms, and information retrieval
systems. The use of computation
              to explore new science
and engineering concepts is central to the
              project.
This multi-disciplinary project is driven by
collaboration with the
              Boeing company on its industrial
software project SOCS which solves many
              large-scale
optimal control problems that occur in chemical
reactions, and a
              large variety of aerospace problems.
