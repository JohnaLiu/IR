Abstract    :
              This international field camp will bring together students from the United
              States, European Union and Central Asia to learn geologic mapping skills. The
              principal investigators are Dr. Ray J. Weldon from the University of Oregon
              Eugene and Dr. Kanatbek Abdrahkmatov from the Kyrgyz Institute of
              Seismology.

The Tien Shan Mountains offer superb exposure and complex
              geology where the students will be able to address some of the most fundamental
              questions on mountain building and interactions of older and younger
              deformational events.  The Tien Shan will introduce the students to a
              completely new class of structures that are not well exposed in the US.  The
              mapping projects are designed to answer specific scientific questions about the
              active deformation in the Tien Shan, as well as to provide excellent learning
              situations for the students.  This project will also further understanding of
              the geology and geodynamics of the Tien Shan orogen, that currently absorbs
              half of the shortening caused by the collision of Eurasia and the Indian
              subcontinent.

This project in earth sciences research will train students in
              field mapping and will enhance the development of ties between the next
              generation of geoscientists.   This project also fulfills the program
              objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern
              Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong
              mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and
              mutuality of benefit.
