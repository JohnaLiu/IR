The initiation of flowering is a critical developmental
              decision in the plant life cycle. 
A common environmental cue used by many
              plant species to initiate flowering during the 
proper season is the change of
              day-length (photoperiod). The perception of photoperiod relies upon the
              circadian clock. Genetical studies over the past two decades indicate that a
              
significant fraction of the genome is involved in flowering-time control. Our
              project goal is to screen the collections of T-DNA insertion lines we have
              created for mutants that 
are early flowering in non-inductive photoperiods. 
              These mutants will identify a set of genes involved in the biological function
              of daylength perception and the circadian rhythm network.  Our preliminary
              results indicate that many of these genes will be unique to the plant genome
              (i.e., no obvious homologs in animals or fungi) and that large-scale forward
              genetic screens are the most efficient way to identify these plant-specific
              genes. This area of research holds much promise for the discovery of novel
              plant genes and gene families, and in the long term will contribute to
              understanding the intimate link between the circadian clock and photoperiod
              perception at a molecular level. Given the central role of the timing of
              flowering in crop productivity, our work may also provide strategies to
              manipulate flowering to enhance crop yields.  

Current information on the
              phenotypes, map location and gene identities of the mutants that we
              characterize will be available at http://www.biochem.wisc.edu/2010flowering/  
              (this site will be available in December 2002) and we will notify The
              Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) (http://www.arabidopsis.org/home.html)
              of gene identities so that they can update their annotation.  All mutants will
              be deposited with the Ohio State University Arabidopsis stock center
              (http://www.biosci.ohiostate.edu/~plantbio/Facilities/abrc/ABRCHOME.HTM).
