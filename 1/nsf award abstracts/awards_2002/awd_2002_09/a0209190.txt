Abstract    :
              This project will study databases that are distributed among a set of
sensors
              that communicate without a fixed network infrastructure. This architecture is
              motivated by new types of emerging wireless broadcast networks such as Mobile
              Ad-hoc Networks, "smart dust", and sensor networks. Smart dust and sensor
              networks consist of processors that may be the size of a dust particle, and the
              processors may be sprayed or parachuted from an airplane.

Two environments
              are considered. In the first one the sensors are static,
and in the second one
              the nodes are mobile, and their locations are not always known.

The  project
              will explore the following paradigm, called "geographic
dissemination of
              data", for processing queries, triggers and updates. The paradigm calls for
              dividing the geographic area into cells. Each data item in the database is
              associated with a cell, and resides in that cell, i.e.
in the set of
              processors that are currently located in the cell (note that
this set may vary
              over time). Each cell is considered  a node of the distributed database, and
              queries/triggers/updates are processed by sending them to the appropriate
              cells. Note that in contrast to the traditional cellular architecture, the
              proposed one is infrastructureless.
