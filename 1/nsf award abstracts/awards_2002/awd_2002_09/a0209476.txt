Abstract    :
              This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research by Professor Charles P. Casey at the University of Wisconsin
              to develop an understanding of industrially-important metallocene
              polymerization catalysis and to pursue new synthetic paths to enediyne
              complexes that may facilitate the preparation of enediyne anticancer drugs.  
              Metallocene catalysts have revolutionized the polymer industry and now account
              for the production of over 2 billion poinds of polyethylene a year.  This
              research will look at a key step in the polymer chain-lengthening process by
              exploring the detailed structural dependence of alkene insertion into
              metallocene alkyls.  A new synthetic reaction involving alkynyl carbene
              complexes, which juxtapose a metal-carbon double bond with a carbon-carbon
              triple bond, will be used to generate regioselective dimerization of the
              organic portion to yield enediyne complexes through a coupling of the terminal
              alkyne carbons.  The initial focus will be on manganese compounds, which are
              more economical and more amenable to release of the metal ion.  Since reactions
              of the alkynylcarbene complexes suggest a carbene-like reactivity at the remote
              alkynyl carbon, experiments will be undertaken to determine whether such
              complexes can react as if they were dicarbenes.

The details of how catalysts
              add carbon groups in important industrial polymerization processes will be
              determined.  A novel class of reagents that offers new routes to the
              preparation of an important class of anticancer drugs will be developed.
