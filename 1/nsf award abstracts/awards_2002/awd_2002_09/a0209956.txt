This three-year award supports US-UK cooperative research and
              undergraduate research experiences in organic chemistry.  The investigators are
              Andrew N. French at Albion College and Thomas Wirth at Cardiff University in
              Wales.  The project involves the synthesis of chiral hypervalent iodine
              compounds. The goals are to design new chiral hypervalent iodine reagents, to
              determine their scope and limitations, and to investigate the possibility of
              catalysis.  Undergraduate students will perform both synthesis and evaluation
              of the compounds, first during a semester in the US laboratory, then followed
              by a summer in Wales with the Wirth group. 

The US researcher brings to this
              project expertise in synthesis and evaluation of chiral hypervalent iodine
              compounds.  This is complemented by the similar UK's expertise in
              organoselenium chemistry and reagents.  This research partnership will advance
              the chemistry of new reagents and their possible uses.  It will also integrate
              education and research in an international environment.  The US undergraduates
              will have an opportunity to conduct research in a laboratory at a major
              graduate institution and university in the United Kingdom.
