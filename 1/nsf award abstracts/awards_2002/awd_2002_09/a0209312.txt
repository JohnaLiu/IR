Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support, Professor Marvin Rowe, his graduate
              student, Ph.D. candidate Karen Steelman, and their archaeological and
              accelerator mass spectrometry colleagues will conduct research attempting to
              demonstrate that plasma-chemical extraction (PCE) of organic carbon can be
              accomplished virtually non-destructively for many sorts of perishable
              archaeological artifacts. The team brings expertise developed over the past
              decade and a half, a time in which Dr. Rowe and his graduate students perfected
              the PCE technique for removal of minute amounts (about 0.1 milligrams of
              carbon) organic carbon from rock paintings to allow accelerator mass
              spectrometric radiocarbon dating of those images. That laboratory remains the
              sole laboratory capable of direct dates on pictographs independent of the
              pigments used. Advantages of non-destructive analysis of rare and valuable
              archaeological artifacts are noteworthy and are more or less obvious. Many
              archaeological samples are inherently rare and precious. For example, four
              notable examples are the Shroud of Turin, the Vinland map, the Kenewick man and
              the 'Iceman'. Non-destructive dates and non-destructive stable isotopic
              determinations (d13C) would provide useful information on such artifacts
              without destroying even small portions of these objects. And archaeologists
              often find preserved perishable artifacts, e.g., textiles, baskets, wood
              carvings, seeds, or papyri, that need require study, especially dating. But
              because of their rarity, they should be conserved, curated and displayed. Their
              destruction presents both practical and ethical problems for archaeologists. In
              all these cases, non-destructive radiocarbon dates and stable carbon isotopic
              measurements would provide data without destruction of even a small part of the
              artifact under question. We have obtained various samples from the Fourth
              International Radiocarbon Intercomparison study to test the PCE radiocarbon and
              stable isotopic analyzes for accuracy and degree of non-destructiveness. Other
              samples have also been obtained for evaluating the accuracy of radiocarbon
              dates and stable carbon isotopic measurements with non-destructive PCE. 
There
              has already been some interest expressed by archaeologists about the
              possibility of non-destructive radiocarbon dates. With National Science
              Foundation support, we thus hope to demonstrate beyond question that we can
              produce accurate dates and d13C values utilizing plasma-chemical extraction of
              minute amounts of carbon.
