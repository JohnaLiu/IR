Abstract    :
              Professor Joseph Wang of New Mexico State University is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study nanoparticle-biopolymer
              assemblies for use as sensors.  In particular, DNA hybridization events will be
              detected electrically on gold nanoparticles, with eventual applications in
              biodiagnostics and biodetection.  New assays that couple multiple amplification
              pathways and an effective magnetic separation will allow for increased
              selectivity and sensitivity in the sensors.  A new electrochemical coding
              technology will be developed for the simultaneous detection of multiple DNA
              targets.  These projects will be combined on microfluidic device platforms. 
              

The ability to miniaturize complex chemical functions to achieve
              lab-on-a-chip is a goal of nanotechnology.  In addition, this work can be
              related to biowarfare detection and thus has implications for national
              security.
