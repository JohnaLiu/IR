Abstract    :
                    The principal investigator intends primarily to pursue the goal of
              
attacking some of the fundamental problems of the Langlands program by
              
means of analytic methods. He is most interested in the case of base 
change
              for holomorphic forms on GL(2) where a non-soluble base change is 
involved,
              but the proposed methods should work much more generally. 
At present the
              intention is to permit the use of the Riemann Hypothesis 
(in an appropriate
              setting) to achieve this goal. A second goal of the 
proposal is to study some
              of the fundamental analytic questions on 
L-functions. 

      This proposal
              is ultimately concerned with finding methods to solve 
equations. Since the
              nineteenth century it has been known that certain 
equations have formulas
              (like the quadratic equation and the cubic 
equation) but that most do not.
              The cases that interest me are the 
equations with ordinary integer
              coefficients. It has become apparent in 
the last fifty years that there
              should be a completely different way of 
studying these general equations by
              using methods from analysis 
(i.e. derived from calculus) rather than by using
              methods from algebra. 
The idea is to describe and prove many properties of
              the solutions (which 
still exist even though there may be no formulas for
              them).
