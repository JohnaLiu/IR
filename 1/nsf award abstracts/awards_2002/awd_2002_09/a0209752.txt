This grant supports an upgrade to the computational
              equipment in the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory and within the Department of
              Earth and Planetary Sciences at UC-Berkeley.  Equipment to be purchased will
              include a multi-CPU SunFire server with expanded RAM, a multi-CPU Beowulf
              cluster of Intel PCs, a RAID system, tape backup system, multiple SunBlade
              workstations, a large format printer, and various network switches and Ethernet
              cards.   UC-Berkeley will share equally in the cost of this upgrade. 
              
Multiple investigators including Romanowicz (global tomography), Burgmann
              (geodesy/tectonics), Dreger (earthquake seismology), Manga and Richards
              (geodynamics), and their students, will immediately benefit from these
              upgrades.
