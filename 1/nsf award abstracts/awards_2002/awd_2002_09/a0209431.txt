The fast growth of the applied area of
              analog-to-digital conversion has simultaneously hindered the solid
              establishment of its mathematical foundations. This has become particularly
              critical with the currently successful technique of  modulation, as recent
              results of the principal investigator have shown the inaccuracy of the
              conversion error model universally adopted until now. The research proposed in
              this project is based on recent discoveries of fundamental algebraic properties
              of n th order modulators and aims at establishing the first general algebraic
              foundations to modulation. On going research has already proved effective in
              correcting the classical error model. Although new practical improved
              techniques may not be the immediate outcome to this small grant proposal, the
              establishments of solid foundations will enable the growth of powerful
              analytical tools, opening new directions of design not accessible by the
              currently empirical approach to modulation.
