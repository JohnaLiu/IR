Abstract    :
              An enhanced understanding of protein-protein interactions is important to the
              successful elucidation of multiprotein pathways, which mediate such vital
              processes as the response of cells to their environment, metabolic regulation,
              and development.  Alpha-helical scaffolding domains form extended surfaces for
              protein interactions by stacking together multiple small repeat units.  In this
              project, computer-assisted bioinformatic techniques will be used to predict
              alpha helical scaffold domains encoded by the fully sequenced genome of the
              model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  Lines of mutant plants will then be obtained
              where these genes have been knocked out, and the effects of this change upon
              the function of the plants will be assessed by testing their growth, gene
              expression, and biochemical activity.  Proteins, which interact with these
              candidate scaffold domains, will be detected by their ability to bind to them
              in a yeast or bacterial protein interaction assay system.  The identified
              interaction proteins will then be analyzed by a similar series of computational
              and plant functional tests.  The goal of the 2010 Project is to discover the
              function of every encoded protein of Arabidopsis by that target date.  This
              project will provide the plant research community with an inventory of
              Arabidopsis scaffolding proteins, their protein interaction partners,
              functional hypotheses, and a set of characterized mutant seed stocks.  This
              project will be executed primarily by undergraduate students, who will receive
              hands on training in cutting edge research techniques.  More information can be
              obtained at the project web site: http://www.ptloma.edu/Biology/Grants/NSF 2010
