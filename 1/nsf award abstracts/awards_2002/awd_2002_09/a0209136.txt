Abstract    :
              INTERDISCIPLINARY WORKSHOP ON REPUTATION MECHANISMS IN ONLINE
              COMMUNITIES

This is an interdisciplinary academic symposium on Reputation
              Systems.  The production of trust is an important requirement for forming and
              growing open online communities. Online reputation reporting systems, such as
              eBay's well-known feedback mechanism, have emerged as an important trust
              building mechanism in such settings. The rising practical importance of online
              reputation systems invites rigorous research in this largely virgin territory.
              Do these systems truly promote efficient market outcomes? To what extent can
              they be manipulated by strategic buyers and sellers? What is the best way to
              design them? How should buyers (and sellers) use the information provided by
              such mechanisms in their decision-making process? This is just a small subset
              of unanswered questions, which invite exciting and valuable research. This
              workshop will bring together scholars and practitioners from a wide range of
              disciplines whose research informs the analysis and design of reputation
              systems. The workshop chairs will prepare a report summarizing the conclusions
              of the symposium. The report will provide a snapshot of the current state of
              the field and an agenda for future research.
