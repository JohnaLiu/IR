Abstract    :
              Embedded systems require maximum performance from a processor
              within
significant constraints in power consumption and chip cost. 
              Using
software pipelining, high-performance digital signal processors
              can
often exploit considerable instruction-level parallelism (ILP), and
thus
              significantly improve performance. However, software pipelining
sometimes
              fails to utilize the processor efficiently and may hinder
the goals of low
              power consumption and chip cost.

The problems with software pipelining can
              be ameliorated by using
advanced compiler loop transformation techniques. 
              However, current
methods for applying loop transformations are lacking.
              Metrics for
applying loop transformations do not model high-performance
              digital
signal processing (DSP) architectures and the effects of
              software
pipelining effectively. 

This research will address the above
              problems by developing
and experimentally validating the following:

1) A
              performance metric that accurately models software-pipelined
loop performance
              on high-performance DSP architectures. 

2) A prediction of the register
              pressure of a software-pipelined
loop before high-level loop transformations
              are applied.

As a result of this research, more ILP will be exploited in
              DSP
applications, resulting in an increase in performance and a savings
              in
the overall energy required to execute an application. Improvements
              in
performance and energy usage will allow better and more
computationally
              expensive algorithms to be used in embedded systems.
