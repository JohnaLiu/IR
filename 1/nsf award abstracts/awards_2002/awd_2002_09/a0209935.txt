Partial support is provided for the 2002 biannual Gordon Research
              Conference on Thin Film Mechanical Behavior.  The conference will be held July
              14-19 at Colby College in Waterville, Maine.  Session topics include global and
              local film behavior, stress effects, time dependent behavior, adhesion, contact
              mechanics, electromigration, and magnetic and electrical effects.  The Gordon
              Conference format will assure that cutting edge research is discussed
              extensively in an informal atmosphere.  NSF support will be used primarily to
              support the attendance of graduate students and junior researchers.  The
              outcomes of the conference will be advances in basic science and follow-on
              impact on industrial applications in this critical area as results transfer to
              industry.
