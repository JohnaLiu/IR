Abstract    :
              Filament channels are the common denominator for the origin of coronal mass
              ejections, erupting filaments and associated flares. These events do not occur
              until the filament has reached a critical stage of development. This proposal
              consists of five observational projects and one theoretical project all aimed
              at the single goal of understanding the origin and evolution of filament
              channels as a physical basis to elements of space weather.
