Abstract    :
              This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research by Thomas C. Flood, Department of Chemistry, University of
              Southern California, in fundamental studies of alkane activation and
              functionalization. They are particularly interested in understanding the weak
              interactions of alkanes with electrophilic metal centers. These sigma complexed
              alkane intermediates may play a key role in many primary reactions involved in
              catalysis. One catalytic transformation Flood is concentrating on is the
              oxidation of methane to methanol using a rhodium or osmium catalyst. A flexible
              triamine ligand such as 1,4,7-triazacyclononane (tacn or Cn) complexes and
              stabilizes the catalyst and will not decompose under the reaction conditions
              

New catalysts and processes may be designed as a result of detailed
              understanding of the way alkanes interact with metal centers,. The efficient
              conversion of alkanes to alcohols is a longstanding goal of the chemical
              industry. Students will be trained in the synthesis, characterization and
              mechanistic studies of these potential catalysts and catalyst precursors.
