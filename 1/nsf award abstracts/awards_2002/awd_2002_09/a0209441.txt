Abstract    :
              The aim of this project is to explore the role that developmental regulatory
              mechanisms play in producing variation in natural populations. To study this
              topic, the investigators are using Heliconius butterflies as a system for
              studying the evolution of gene regulation from a molecular perspective. 
              Several of the color pattern genes in Heliconius that allow regional races to
              participate in adaptive mimicry behavior act as simple switches in a pigment
              biosynthesis pathway. The biosynthetic pathways that produce pigments in
              butterfly wings are well known, and this research will test how simple changes
              in the regulation of specific intermediate pigment synthesis and transport
              genes may result in wing pattern variation within and between species.
              

Understanding evolution at the mechanistic level is critical for effective
              management of, for instance, the adaptive resistance in pathogen and pest
              species. It is of immediate benefit to develop a basic understanding of the
              genetic basis of how organisms develop new significant characteristics over
              short time spans. Butterfly wing patterns provide a tractable model system for
              studying adaptive genetic change at the population level.
