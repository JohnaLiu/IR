Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to enable an efficient solution by a
              regularized Newton method of three-dimensional inverse acoustic and
              elastoacoustic scattering problems. The research will be based upon three
              cornerstones.  The convergence analysis of the regularized Newton method will
              be performed to establish confidence in this approach and shed some light on
              the selection of the regularization parameter. In order to ensure the
              stability, fast convergence, and computational efficiency of this iterative
              solution strategy, the characterization of the Frechet derivatives of the
              scattered field with respect to the shape parameters and the Finite Element
              Tearing and Interconnecting Helmholtz (FETI-H) domain decomposition method will
              be extended to address coupled elastoacoustic problems. Since the far-field
              pattern is in general measured only in a limited aperture, two different
              approaches for reconstructing the full aperture data will also be
              investigated.

The determination of the shape of an obstacle from its effects
              on known acoustic or electromagnetic waves is an important problem in many
              technologies such as sonar, radar, geophysical exploration, medical imaging and
              nondestructive testing. This project will develop an efficient computational
              method for the inverse acoustic scattering problem. The proposed methodologies
              also have a great potential for benefiting the infrastructure of computational
              sciences.
