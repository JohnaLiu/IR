Abstract    :
              This project focuses on system-level mapping of applications written in
              imperative programming languages such as C to multiple FPGA computing systems
              by the synergistic collaboration of program analysis, parallelizing compiler
              technology and behavioral synthesis tools. The proposed research addresses
              system-level partitioning and scheduling of the execution of tasks among
              computing cores based on high-level program analysis as well as managing the
              storage and movement of data between both internal and external memories and
              between tasks. This project is the first comprehensive, and automatic,
              integration of parallelizing compiler technology with EDA synthesis. It is also
              the first attempt to integrate in a compiler high-level loop transformations
              guided by estimates provided by commercially available synthesis tools. The end
              result is a realistic and accurate design space exploration strategy we believe
              is widely applicable to current and future multiple FPGA systems as well as
              future System-On-a-Chip (SoC) systems. An automated application mapping
              approach that addresses system-level issues as proposed in this research will
              ultimately allow designers to explore a wider range 
of application mapping
              strategies for SoC systems.
