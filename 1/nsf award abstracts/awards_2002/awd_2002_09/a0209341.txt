Abstract    :
              

Allen University HBCU-UP supported planning efforts will focus on three
              aspects of the institution's science, technology, engineering and mathematics
              (STEM) instructional and research infrastructure: (1) STEM teaching and
              learning; (2) undergraduate and faculty research opportunities; and, (3)
              partnerships with industry and other institutions of higher learning.

The
              assessment plan includes evaluations of student performance and progress toward
              STEM degree completion. Impediments to student successful completion of core
              STEM courses and participation in research will be identified and remedied. 
              Particular emphasis will be placed on (1) enhancing teaching strategies; (2)
              increasing undergraduate research opportunities; (3) faculty development; (4)
              curriculum reform; (5) infusion of technology to enhance instruction; and, (6)
              the adaptation of best practices to broaden the participation of
              underrepresented minorities in STEM fields and the STEM workforce.
