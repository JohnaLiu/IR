Abstract    :
              This research project, with the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, addresses questions of fundamental importance in the dynamics of
              adsorption and reaction on surfaces driven by photon and electron excitation. 
              Professors Petek and Yates, at the University of Pittsburgh, combine
              femtosecond time resolved two photon photoemission with electron stimulated
              desorption ion angular distribution studies to probe the effects of substrate
              electronic structure on the detailed photochemistry of simple adsorbates on
              well characterized metal surfaces.  Sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide adsorbed
              on silver and platinum surfaces are the model systems of interest.  Time
              resolved photoemission microscopy provides information about the effect of
              specific defect sites on the surface photochemical process.  Information from
              these studies provides fundamental insight into the operation of nanoscale
              structures and devices. 

A detailed understanding of the effect of substrate
              electronic structure on the dynamics of photon initiated chemistry at surfaces
              is the focus of this research project.  With the support of the Analytical and
              Surface Chemistry Program, Professors Petek and Yates at the University of
              Pittsburgh are probing these questions.  Using time resolved photoemission
              methods, combined with structural information obtained from desorbed ion
              angular distributions, fundamental understanding of the dynamics of photon and
              electron initiated surface processes is obtained.
