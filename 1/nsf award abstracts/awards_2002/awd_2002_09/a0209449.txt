Abstract    :
              Funding for computer scientists in quan um information processing has come from
              a variety of
programs a NSF. While a new QuBIC program has been announced in
              he EIA division of CISE,
there is arguably a need for a focused program on
              quantum information processing with a direct
focus on he computer science
              aspects of he research. The C-CR division of CISE would be the
natural
              location for such a program on "Quantum Communications, Cryptography and
              Coding."
To gauge the need and plan what migh be the scientific coverage and
              research agenda for such
a potential program,we plan to bring several of he
              leading researchers together for a planning
workshop.This workshop will lead
              to a five-to ten-page report that will give a detailed assessment
of the need
              for a new C-CR program and give a descrip ion of he research areas ha such a
              program
should focus on. By having a C-CR program on "Quantum Communications,
              Cryptography and
Coding," NSF would be able to focus its efforts on he
              computer science aspects of quanum
information processing and greatly enhance
              its ability o make sure he United States keeps its
leading role in his
              important area. This workshop and report will be the first important step
              in
planning such a program.
