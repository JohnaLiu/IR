Abstract    :
              This project will develop authorization mechanisms for secure information access
              by a large community of users in an open environment. The research problem is
              to formalize the trust that is associated with each user for granting
              privileges of access to data warehouse and the World Wide Web. Evidence is used
              to prove certain propertied of a user in order to build a trust model. Evidence
              is formalized and a computational model for the reliability of evidence is
              developed. This research combines the concepts of role-based access control,
              user behaviors and profiles, mathematical theory of evidence, and data mining.
              This research contributes to the design and develo0pment of a trust-enhanced
              role mapping server, For adaptive authorization, this server cooperates with
              existing role-based access control mechanisms. A series of experiments are
              planned to study the performance issues of the trust model prototype. Efficient
              and adaptive algorithms for role assignment will be developed as a result of
              these experimental studies. This research will provide a framework for secure
              authorization systems within applications in the semantic web, e-commerce,
              airport security procedures, intelligence gathering and policymaking in
              military, homeland security and database access in general.
