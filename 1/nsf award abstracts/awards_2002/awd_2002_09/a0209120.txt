Abstract    :
              This project will create a comprehensive test-bed facility to support research
              in video database management. Real-world video applications demand database
              technology that is capable of providing real-time content-based query and
              retrieval for stored digital video. However, video is a complex data type that
              requires a significant amount of preprocessing for content representation
              before research issues in database management for real-time video data can be
              addressed. This project will facilitate video database research by abstracting
              video as a fundamental and fully functional database data type. Tools for video
              content analysis, feature extraction and high-dimensional indexing will be
              integrated into the test-bed facility, which will then be used to address
              several research challenges in the management of real-time streamed video data,
              including multi-feature nearest neighbor queries, feature-based query
              processing, video operators, buffer management for streaming video, and
              continuous video streaming with real-time constraints. The system will provide
              standardized methods for integrating components and measuring their
              performance, and will be furnished with a large collection of indexed videos.
              The underlying database management system, video-processing tools, and video
              data will form a complete environment for the video database research
              community, providing an effective platform for implementation, validation and
              evaluation of new video database technology.
