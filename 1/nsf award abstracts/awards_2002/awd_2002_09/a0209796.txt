Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to carry out systematic investigations for obtaining precursors
              to the enigmatic occurrence of the Equatorial Spread-F (ESF) using daytime
              thermospheric optical emission measurements from the South American longitude
              using high-resolution optical spectrographs built at Boston University.  ESF
              refers to the presence of irregularities in the nighttime equatorial
              ionosphere.  Unlike substorms and geomagnetic storms, ESF is a form of space
              weather not controlled exclusively by the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF). 
              ESF irregularities have a severe impact on radio communications and
              navigational systems at a wide range of frequencies that adversely affect
              commercial and defense applications.  The development of these irregularities
              is highly unpredictable.  Even during the 'ESF' season when various onset
              parameters are nearly identical, ESF occurs on one night and is completely
              absent on the other.  Scientifically, this is a missing element in our
              understanding of plasma instabilities at low latitudes.  Hence, it is very
              important to study and attempt to predict ESF and its adverse effects.
