Abstract    :
              Recently a new generation of P2P systems, offering distributed hash
table (DHT)
              functionality, have been proposed.  These systems greatly
improve the
              scalability and exact-match accuracy of P2P systems, but
offer only the
              exact-match query facility.  This proposal outlines a
research agenda for
              building complex query facilities on top of these
DHT-based P2P systems. 
              There are three defining directions of the
proposed research agenda:

  
              Core Algebra: Explore the implementation of a core set of
   algebraic query
              operators that run over DHTs in a P2P network.

   DHT APIs: Identify the
              minimum set of primitives and functions that
   need to be implemented by a
              P2P network in order to efficiently
   support the query operators.

  
              Query Optimization: P2P networks are often distributed across slow
   network
              links, and may benefit from distributed database
   optimizations like the use
              of semi-joins.  However, it is not clear
   how the various ideas in the query
              processing literature map into
   the P2P context, particularly when using
              DHTs for routing during
   query processing.  This proposal intends to study
              the costs and
   tradeoffs of various alternatives for the query plan space in
              this
   context.

Simulation of large networks will be used to study the
              proposed
techniques at Internet scale.
