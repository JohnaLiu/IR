Abstract    :
              Howard University is hosting IARD 2002, the third biennial conference of the
              International Association of Relativistic Dynamics.  The overall goal of the
              conference is to facilitate the understanding of problems and the acquisition
              and dissemination of knowledge about relativistic dynamics at all levels.  This
              award will enable increased participation of students and postdoctoral
              researchers in the conference activities.  Their participation in this
              conference provides them with unique and extensive access to the leaders in
              their field, exposes them to new research opportunities and techniques and
              helps prepare them for leadership roles in the future.
