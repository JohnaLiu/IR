Abstract

The
              unsolicited proposal from the American Statistical Association (ASA) to the
              Division of Science Resources Statistics (SRS) of the National Science
              Foundation involves establishing an ASA/SRS-NSF Research Program.  The Program
              would entail having an outstanding academic researcher/fellow conduct
              interdisciplinary research using SRS data.  The researcher/fellow would be
              selected through a rigorous, competitive application process.  The proposed
              program is similar to other that ASA has established with several other Federal
              statistical agencies including the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Economic
              Analysis, the National Center for Health Statistics, the National Center for
              Education Statistics, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
