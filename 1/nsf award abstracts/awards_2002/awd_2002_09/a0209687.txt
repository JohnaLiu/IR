Abstract    :
              
	NER:  Oligonucleotide-directed alignment of cytoskeletal 
	filaments for
              nanoscale assembly

There is currently great interest in nanoscience and
              nanotechnology for manipulating material at submicron scales.  In cells,
              however, this is a routine task -- the transport of intracellular cargo is
              carried out by motor proteins that move along cytoskeletal filaments called
              microtubules.  Directional movement is achieved because microtubules have a
              structural polarity and motors move unidirectionally along them, with different
              motors moving in different directions.  We seek to: (i) reconstruct the
              intracellular transport system in vitro using purified kinesin motor proteins
              and microtubules, and (ii) use it to transport defined cargo (biological or
              synthetic nanoscale objects) to specific sites on a two-dimensional substrate. 
              To lay down microtubule tracks with desired orientations, we will take
              advantage of the specificity and reversibility of DNA hybridization as a
              "molecular glue".  Single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides will be attached to
              defined sites on glass surfaces and complementary oligonucleotides will be
              covalently attached to microtubules.  By making microtubules whose ends are
              functionalized with different DNA sequences and spatially patterning their
              sequence complements, a variety of microtubule geometries will be investigated.
               These tracks will be used to direct the motion of cargo-laden kinesin motors
              as a step towards building systems for biomolecular separations or directed
              assembly applications.
