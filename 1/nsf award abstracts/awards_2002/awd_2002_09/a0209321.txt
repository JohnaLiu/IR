Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is refinement of the Kulinkovich reaction which
              involves the titanium-mediated cyclopropanation of esters and the use of the
              resulting heteroatom-substituted cyclopropanes as synthetic intermediates for
              medium size ring formation.  Methods for asymmetric cyclopropanation,
              cyclopropanol and cyclopropylamine-mediated syntheses, and the elaboration of
              vinylcyclobutanols will be pursued and a total synthesis of the natural product
              suberosenone will be used to highlight the methodology.

With this renewal
              award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
              research of Dr. Jin K. Cha of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
              Alabama.  Professor Cha will focus his work on the development of methods for
              the stereoselective construction of  carbocycles by taking advantage of the
              release of ring strain present in readily available heteroatom-substituted
              cyclopropanes. The research has potential broader impact in the pharmaceutical
              and agricultural industries and presents an excellent vehicle for the training
              of students.
