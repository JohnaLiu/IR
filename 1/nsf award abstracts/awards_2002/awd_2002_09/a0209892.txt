Scientist from the
              University of Alaska, University of California Los Angeles, and the China
              Seismological Bureau are carrying out a a rapid response to the November 14,
              2001 Mw~7.9 Kunlun fault earthquake in Tibet. This earthquake provides a unique
              opportunity to measure the postseismic deformation of an M~8 earthquake that
              occurred within a pre-existing geodetic network in which relative site
              velocities are known to about 1 mm/yr., Three continuously recording GPS sites
              near the rupture and a fourth about 150 km away were established one week after
              the event by the China Seismological Bureau. Also, 17 existing and new GPS
              sites along the Qinghai-Tibet highway were surveyed in December, 2001. A second
              field campaign is extending GPS network westward from the Qinghai-Tibet
              highway, adding new sites along the fault on either side of surface rupture in
              the near field. This survey is repeating measurements at all of the sites
              surveyed in November-December, providing the initial postseismic results. These
              measurements will lead to a better understanding of  the rheological structure
              of the exceptionally thick northern Tibetan crust as well as the postseismic
              processes triggered by such a large event.
