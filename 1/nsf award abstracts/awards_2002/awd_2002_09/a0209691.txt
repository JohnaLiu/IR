Abstract    :
              The main objective of the Gordon Research Photonuclear Conference is
to provide
              the international community of nuclear scientists with a
unique forum in which
              the newest developments at the forefront of
this science can be presented and
              subjected to detailed and extended
discussions and criticism. The purpose of
              the conference is to
encourage communication and the discussions to be
              conducted in an
atmosphere conducive to open interactions between the
              scientists,
provoking new and even speculative ideas for future research.
              To
accomplish these goals requires the participation in all of the
conference
              activities of a significant number of leaders in the
field. The participation
              of younger scientists is essential to
address the future manpower needs of
              this rapidly changing field.
Therefore, bright and promising postdoctoral
              researchers and
graduate students have been specially selected for
              participation in
this conference and encouraged to present their ideas.
              Their
participation in this conference provides them with unique
              and
extensive access to the leaders in their field, exposes them to
              new
research opportunities and techniques and helps prepare them for
              the
leadership roles they will assume in the future. This award
              will
facilitate participation from these junior scientists.
