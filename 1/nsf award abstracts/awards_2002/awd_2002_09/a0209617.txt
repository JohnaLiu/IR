     Robust global implicit representations of curves
              and
surfaces simplify geometric operations such as evolving,
offsetting and
              intersecting, while requiring accurate contouring
and efficient
              implicitization techniques.  The investigator
focuses on fast new algorithms
              for the three key issues of
implicit representations:
   1.  Fast accurate
              multiresolution methods that extract
piecewise-smooth contours with tightly
              controlled geometry.  These
methods alternate between global topology
              resolution and local
differential-algebraic boundary value problems, and
              solve
industrial problems ranging from machine tooling to horizon
finding.
 
               2.  Efficient implicitization methods that build a
distributed implicit
              representation from given curves or
surfaces.  These methods, which invert
              contouring, are essential
to modeling moving material interfaces such as the
              solid-liquid
interface in melt growth of silicon crystals.
   3.  Fast stable
              deferred correction methods for the accurate
solution of ordinary and partial
              differential-algebraic initial
and boundary value problems that control local
              geometry.
Differential-algebraic problems occur widely in engineering,
              and
challenge existing numerical methods.  For example, automated
vehicle
              piloting requires real-time solution of differential
systems with constraints
              that keep the tires on the road.
     Computer models of complex interlocking
              physical objects
dominate technological processes ranging from
              semiconductor
etching to surgery planning, from computer animation
              to
computer-controlled machine tooling.  Key steps in these processes
involve
              operations such as evolving, navigating, intersecting and
blending on these
              objects.  The investigator and his students are
developing efficient new
              computational tools for simulating these
operations in robust user-friendly
              ways.  This highly
interdisciplinary enterprise combines mathematics and
              computer
science to benefit scientific endeavors ranging from cartography
to
              crystallography.  The research objectives intertwine with an
interdisciplinary
              educational program, training future scientists
and engineers through
              web-enabled courses,
math/science/engineering seminars, and individual
              student
research mentoring.
