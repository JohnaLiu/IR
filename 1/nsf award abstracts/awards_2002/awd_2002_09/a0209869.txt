Abstract    :
              Mississippi State University (MSU), an NSA Center of Excellence in Information
              Assurance Education (COE/IAE), will work with Jackson State University (JSU)
              and the University of Kansas (KU) though a collaborative and cooperative effort
              to increase these two institutions capacity in information assurance and to
              strengthen the COE/IAE program at MSU.  The faculty from all three institutions
              will work to develop an IA curriculum at JSU and KU with an expectation that
              both schools will apply for COE/IAE status during academic year
              2004-2005.

These collaboration efforts are intended to be beneficial to all
              three parties in not only developing an IA program at two universities that
              currently do not have one but also in strengthening the program at MSU by
              broadening its research effort, increasing minority representation in its PhD
              program, and by enhancing its instructional course content.  MSU will
              additionally expand its IA offerings by involving the College of Business and
              the College of Arts and Sciences in our research.   This proposal initiates an
              innovative programs that will promote student research and publication in this
              area.
