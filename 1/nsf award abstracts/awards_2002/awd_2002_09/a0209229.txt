Abstract    :
              This project proposes to measure the rate coefficient for the collisional
              removal of O2 by oxygen atoms as a function of temperature in the range 300-800
              K. This measurement is a key step in quantifying a new approach for
              interpreting the strong ionospheric emissions from O2 and thereby deriving
              altitude profiles of oxygen atom density and local temperature. Extensive data
              sets of these 750-780 nm emissions are already available from the Midcourse
              Space Experiment (MSX) and the Arizona Airglow (GLO) studies and can provide
              global altitude-dependent O( 3 P) atom density maps, once the above rate
              coefficient has been determined. Simultaneously, the shape of the atmospheric
              O2 emission band envelopes can provide the local temperature. The proposed
              laboratory experiments will thus significantly improve the current
              unsatisfactory understanding of thermospheric emissions from O2.
