Abstract    :
              This workshop is for university faculty, department heads and deans as well as
              economists, nationally recognized experts from the electric power industry, and
              experts in adaptive systems to explore advanced research needs in the fields of
              Economics, Power Systems and Adaptive Systems. The workshop is intended to
              identify the basic theoretical problems now facing the electric, power industry
              in the United States and suggest research needs that can be addressed by NSF in
              the future. This is the second of a series of three NSF/EPRI workshops, whose
              ultimate goal is to promote research leading to new solutions to existing
              problems facing the electric power industry.
