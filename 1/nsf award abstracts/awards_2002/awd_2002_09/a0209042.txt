Abstract    :
              The rise of ubiquitous computing has prompted the need for a change in the way
              we store and access information. It calls for the study of data storage systems
              that distribute information over wide area networks, enabling users to store
              and access critical data in a continuously available and highly trustable
              fashion. The problem of data distribution, i.e.,  storing data in networked
              storage systems while achieving data reliability, confidentiality and
              performance is studied.

Data distribution schemes based on (n,k) error
              correcting codes are investigated. The research will focus on two key
              questions: 1) how to achieve strong and computationally efficient data
              encryption while storing data over a distributed networked environment? and 2)
              how to place encoded data segments in networked systems, while considering the
              structure of the network topology, to enable high performance and reliable data
              retrieval? 

Insights and results from this research program will provide
              guidelines for efficient, secure and reliable data distribution schemes for
              wired and wireless networks, as well as make significant contributions to
              related theory study, such as cryptography, coding theory, graph theory and
              combinatorics. In addition, efforts will be made to integrate this research
              program into educational activities.
