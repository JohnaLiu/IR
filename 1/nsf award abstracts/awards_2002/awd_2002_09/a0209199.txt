Abstract    :
              Mining sequential patterns and structured patterns (e.g., trees, lattices, 
and
              graphs) are important data mining tasks, with broad applications, such 
as the
              analysis of customer purchase sequences and Web page structures,
              
understanding of disease treatments, scientific experiments, transportation
              
and production processes, detection of anomaly and unusual patterns,
              
discovery of bio-molecule sequences and structures, and so on.

This
              project is to perform a systematic investigation of the principles,
              
algorithms, and applications of scalable sequential and structured pattern
              
mining, which covers the following issues: (1) development of highly scalable
              
mining algorithms, including mining max-patterns, closed patterns and top-k
              
patterns; (2) investigation of highly flexible mining methodologies,
              
including mining of multi-dimensional multi-level sequential and structured
              
patterns and constraint-based mining; (3) extension of the scope to cover
              
sequential or structured pattern-based clustering; and (4) application of
              
multi-dimensional, multi-level sequential or structured pattern mining for
              
intrusion detection, Web mining, and other important applications.  This
              
will lead to a set of efficient, scalable, and flexible sequential and
              
structured pattern mining methods for scientific and industrial
              applications.
