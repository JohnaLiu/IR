Abstract    :
              This project, to be conducted by a doctoral student in anthropology from Rutgers
              University, investigates how two processes, public health discourse and TV
              consumer culture, are reshaping  adolescent values surrounding gender relations
              on Nevis, a small English-speaking island in the Eastern Caribbean. While
              social and economic life throughout the Caribbean has historically been built
              upon a complex and dynamic interchange between local and global forces, new
              forces are rapidly changing Caribbean societies. At the present time, Nevis is
              experiencing an influx of returning nationals as well as immigrants who arrive
              to work in the growing tourist industry. In addition to this demographic
              influence, mass media (cable television) brings more global influence. The
              growing Caribbean AIDS epidemic, in tandem with the other global forces, is
              transforming the economic and social milieu in which Nevis adolescents come of
              age. Relying on surveys, focus groups, in-depth interviews, and participant
              observation to collect data, this project investigates how adolescent gender
              role identity is produced within the emerging complex and changing social
              context of Nevis life. The majority of the research will be conducted in two
              communities, Charlestown, the capital of Nevis and Gingerland, a small rural
              agricultural community located inland. The results of this project will
              contribute to knowledge on gender identity, globalization, and cultural change.
              In terms of wider impacts, this project will inform policy makers in their
              effort to work with adolescents so as to limit the spread of HIV
