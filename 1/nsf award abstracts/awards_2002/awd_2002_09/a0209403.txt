The PI's propose a
              method for preparing gradient polymer brushes - structures with spatial
              variation of grafting density of polymers end-anchored on substrates. The PI's
              believe that the proposed set up is unique as it would allow one, for the first
              time, to explore the details of the transition between the brush and mushroom
              conformations. Moreover, they predict that this methodology could have a high
              impact on designing novel materials and structures with unique properties. For
              example, the ability to control the grafting density of macromolecules enables
              us to tailor the barrier properties of the materials, which would make them
              very attractive candidates for high quality filters or membranes. Additionally,
              assembling polymers in brush-like structures is believed to provide
              unprecedented means of generating "nanostructured molecular templates" that can
              be for example used as molecular seeds governing the ordering of non-polymeric
              materials (e.g.,nanoparticles, silicates, etc.) in polymeric matrices.
