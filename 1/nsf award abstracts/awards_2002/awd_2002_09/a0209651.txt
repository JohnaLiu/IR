Abstract    :
              A radically new class of organic materials, the protected oligoacenes and
              polyacenes are proposed.  Unlike the much-explored conjugated polymers, these
              unsaturated macromolecules will be electrical conductors without the need of a
              dopant; they will be they first of the oligocenes, the cyclacenes may exhibit
              even more exotic properties, such as superconductivity at higher temperatures. 
              The proposed syntheses are relatively short, so that large amounts of materials
              will be available for the evaluation of physical properties and device (FET,
              LED, photodiode, etc.) fabrication.

Organic electronic materials have just
              entered the commercial engineering mainstream in the form of light-emitting
              diodes (LEDs), photodiodes (plastic solar cells) and thin film transistors
              (TFTs).  The LEDs produce brighter and cooler light than standard incandescent
              lamps wand will have a large impact on society in terms of energy savings both
              in manufacturing and in use.  The manufacture of organic TFTs will also be much
              more energy-efficient than the equivalent, current, silicon-based devices. 
              Another important societal benefit of the research proposed here will be the
              considerably advance in the education of the graduate and undergraduate
              students supported by these funds.  Development of these organic electronic
              devices will provide a truly interdisciplinary educational foundation for our
              future workforce.
