Abstract    :
              This award supports travel and living expenses for 8 to 10 US advanced students
              to participate in a near-surface volcano-geophysics field camp on Montserrat. 
              The purpose of the field camp is to train these students in the use of advanced
              geophysical equipment in the study of active volcanic terrains.  The request
              for student training takes advantage of an existing US0-NSF and UK-NERC
              sponsored effort to understand the science and hazards of the relatively
              silisic volcanic system on Montserrat.  The student training is further being
              organized so as to take advantage of the advanced volcano-geophysics and
              near-surface enivornmental-geophysics field camp that will be run on Montserrat
              by J. Neuberg (Leeds University, the UK).  As a result, there will be no costs
              for renting or transporting heavy geophysical equipment to this island volcano.
               It is also anticipated that the results of the field camp will be used in
              planning the installation of the geophysical observatories that are part of the
              NSF/NERC sponsored science program on Montserrat.

The educational purpose of
              the field camp will be two fold:  (1) to demonstrate the techniques and value
              of 3D geophysical surveying and data in active volcanic geology, and (2)
              acquaint a large group of students with the scientific objectives and research
              possibilities of the Montserrat progrm. The student fieldwork and data analysis
              include advanced training in modern geophysical investigation methods and
              extensive interactions between industry, government, and the universities
              involved in the Montserrat science program.
