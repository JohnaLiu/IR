Abstract    :
              In modern computer systems, computation is distributed over many host machines.
              Mutually untrusted machines and users coexist, and software is built using
              plug-and-play components downloaded from remote hosts. Multiple users share
              resources so it is critical to ensure, e.g., that private information is not
              compromised.  Languages like Java and C# are designed to provide such security
              by enforcing encapsulation boundaries that restrict interdependencies and
              information flows between program components.  Such boundaries are undercut,
              however, by ubiquitous pointer aliasing which can be maliciously exploited to
              leak sensitive information.

This project studies ways to confine pointers to
              their intended scopes.  The focus is on the interplay between static analysis
              and dynamic access control to achieve confinement.  The technical goal is to
              find confinement regimes that can be used to assure secure information flow in
              systems implemented using dynamic binding, multithreading, inheritance,
              class-based encapsulation, and access control.  Analyses and transformations to
              minimize run-time performance costs for confinement and access control are also
              investigated.  This work will lead to better programming methods and tools for
              development of web-based services and other distributed applications that
              require a high level of assurance.  The work will contribute to technology for
              implementing programming languages and for checking for security flaws in
              application programs.
