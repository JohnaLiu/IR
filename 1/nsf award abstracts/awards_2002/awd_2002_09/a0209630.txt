Abstract    :
              This award supports computational and theoretical research on classical and
              quantum complex systems.  The PI will study quantum complex systems and their
              classical analogs with an aim to elucidate the relationship between them. 
              Research will focus on understanding how the low energy states of the
              two-dimensional  +J/-J Edwards-Anderson spin glass model change when
              quantum-mechanical tunneling is introduced.  The PI will exploit a
              computational algorithm developed to find all the ground states of the
              classical model to enable the calculation of exact quantum eigenstates of much
              larger system sizes than can be computed by other methods, in the limit of
              small tunneling amplitudes. Preliminary results reveal that the quantum ground
              states have a complex and rich structure that will be elucidated further in the
              proposed research. The method is also being used to compare the effects of
              quantum tunneling to other (classical) physical perturbations, such as coupling
              to a deformable lattice.

This award supports computational and
              theoretical research and education on classical and quantum complex systems.
              The PI will use a model of a spin glass to study the relationship between
              quantum complex systems and their classical analogs.  This work is of
              fundamental importance to the fields of statistical mechanics and condensed
              matter physics. It also contributes to efforts to control and manipulate
              quantum mechanical states; such a capability may have long term impact on
              information and communication technologies.
