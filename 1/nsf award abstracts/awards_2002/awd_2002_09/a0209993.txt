              Munroe

This is a proposal submitted by Dr. Jeffrey Munroe,
              Middlebury College, to request a planning visit to the Qinghai and Tibetan
              Plateau, China, to collect information for developing a cooperative study with
              Lanzhou University on late Pleistocene glaciation. This is an important topic
              for understanding the amount of water tied up in glacial ice.  This visit can
              also provide a unique opportunity to two American investigators early in their
              career to visit the plateau and to enrich their knowledge of Asian continental
              glaciation with first-hand observations.
