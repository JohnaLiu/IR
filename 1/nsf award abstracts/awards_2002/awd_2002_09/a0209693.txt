Abstract    :
              The main objective of the Gordon Research Conference on Nuclear
Chemistry is to
              provide the international community of nuclear
scientists with a unique forum
              in which the newest developments at
the forefront of this science can be
              presented and subjected to
detailed and extended discussions and criticism.
              The purpose of the
conference is to encourage communication and the
              discussions to be
conducted in an atmosphere conducive to open interactions
              between
the scientists, provoking new and even speculative ideas for
              future
research. To accomplish these goals requires the participation in
all
              of the conference activities of a significant number of leaders
in the field.
              The participation of younger scientists is essential
to address the future
              manpower needs of this rapidly changing field.
Therefore, bright and promising
              postdoctoral researchers and
graduate students have been specially selected
              for participation in
this conference and encouraged to present their ideas.
              Their
participation in this conference provides them with unique
              and
extensive access to the leaders in their field, exposes them to
              new
research opportunities and techniques and helps prepare them for
              the
leadership roles they will assume in the future. This award
              will
facilitate participation from these junior scientists.
