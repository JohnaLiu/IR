Special Projects:
              Mathematical Sciences Methods for the Study of Deliberate Release of Biological
              Agents and their Consequences

This effort will fund an interdisciplinary
              workshop to investigate the potential uses of methods of the mathematical
              sciences (math, computer sciences, statistics, operations research) to fight
              bioterrorism.  The group will identify the challenges posed by bioterrorism,
              will identify potential uses of mathematical sciences methods to fight it, then
              will focus on specific areas of emphasis.  

The group will examine
              alternative preventative measures such as vaccination, vaccine dilution and
              antibiotic and vaccine stockpiling or responsive strategies such as the
              isolation of individuals, buildings, populations and regions, the rapid control
              of mass transportation systems, and the systematic surveillance of the food and
              water supply.  Topics of interest will include multiple outbreaks, the impact
              of bioterriorism on agricultural systems and food supply, and the spread of
              pathogens through buildings, in water systems, and in communications systems.
