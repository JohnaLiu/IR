Abstract    :
              In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, Sharp will develop techniques to measure electron
              spin-related properties of transition metal ions with total spin greater than
              one. The electron spin physics will be probed indirectly by NMR spectroscopy.
              New methods of orienting paramagnetic molecules in flow-stretched hydrogels
              will be developed. Proof of concept experiments will be performed on
              paramagnetic complexes with spin S = 1, 3/2 and 5/2 and used to test the
              underlying theory. 

Biological and biochemical systems often contain ions
              that are characterized by electron spin. The total electron spin of these units
              plays an important role in the behavior of these systems. While the theory for
              systems with just one unbalanced electron spin is well developed, this is
              usually not the case when transition metal ions are present. The goals of the
              present project are to perform proof of concept experiments and thereby aid in
              the development of a satisfactory theory.  Students will participate in this
              research. They will gain experience in one of the forefront areas of
              contemporary physical chemistry and thereby prepare them for entry into the
              scientific/technological workforce.
