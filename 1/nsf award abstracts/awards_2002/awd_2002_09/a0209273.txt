Abstract    :
              Summary:  This proposal requests support for an international conference on
              Cretaceous climate-ocean dynamics.  The conference will bring together a
              multidisciplinary group of established scientists and students to assess the
              state of knowledge of the nature and mechanics of Cretaceous atmospheric and
              oceanic circulation and identify critical research issues for the next
              decade.
