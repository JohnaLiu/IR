Abstract    :
                   The investigator continues work on the Kneser-Poulsen
Conjecture that was
              started with Professor Karoly Bezdek.  This
conjecture says that if any finite
              collection of disks in the
Euclidean plane is rearranged so that the distance
              between any
pair of centers does not increase, then the area of the
              union
does not increase and the area of the interesection does not
decrease. 
              They have solved the conjecture in the plane, but many
higher-dimensional
              questions remain.  For example, there is a
candidate for a configuration that
              might be a counterexample for
the analogous statement in three-space, and
              there are some
interesting possible differences between the case for a union
              of
disks and the intersection of disks.  Another major topic is the
study of
              linkages in the plane that are locked in the sense that
they can only move a
              small amount without crossing.  The theory
of frameworks and tensegrities
              plays an important role here and
can be applied to give reasonable criteria to
              detect when such a
linkage is locked.  This is continuing work of the
              investigator,
Erik Demaine, and Gunter Rote, who originally solved
              the
carpenter's rule problem, which states that any polygonal arc can
be
              opened without creating any self-intersection.
     The investigator works on
              certain basic, fundamental
questions about the geometry of discrete objects. 
              Just as
physics asks fundamental questions about the nature of matter,
space,
              and the universe, and the physical laws they must obey,
geometry asks
              fundamental questions about how geometric objects
interact and the implicit
              constraints they satisfy.  How does the
area of the union of round disks
              change as the centers are moved
apart?  The investigator (with Karoly Bezdek)
              has shown that the
area behaves (it increases or stays the same) as expected
              in the
plane, but the situation in space is not so clear.  When is a
robot
              arm in the plane rigid, and when can it be opened?  The
investigator (with
              Erik Demaine and Gunter Rote) has shown that
arms open as expected in the
              plane, but what about more
complicated linkages?  What can be said about the
              rigidity of
packings of round balls as a granular material?  The
              investigator
is an expert in such matters, but there are delicate
              questions
about the rigidity in a container with a small number of disks.
The
              volume enclosed by a flexible surface is constant, but what
about other
              geometric invariants? These are concrete tangible
objects, but accessible to
              the appropriate geometric insight.
These questions are both relevant and
              potentially quite useful
for subjects as wide-ranging as cell biology, protein
              folding,
kinematics, and granular materials.  For example, it is
              widely
believed that the geometric structure of a cell has a great deal
to do
              with its function.  So the rigidity of appropriate discrete
objects is
              relevant.  As has been shown over and over again in
physics and mathematics,
              if the questions are to the point,
applications follow.
