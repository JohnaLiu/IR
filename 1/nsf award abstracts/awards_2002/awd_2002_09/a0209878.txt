Digital Government:  Workshop on
              Election Systems Standards

This workshop is a logical successor to a
              Presidentially-mandated workshop on on-line voting, held in October 2000.  The
              extremely close national election in November of 2000 elicited great interest
              in the voting process within the research community.

An outgrowth of that
              interest was a joint effort by Cal Tech and MIT to develop a prototype voting
              system, in the process surfacing many technical, legal, and social issues. 
              This proposed workshop will build on that joint effort, to examine current
              voting systems standards, and develop possible research topics related to those
              standards.
