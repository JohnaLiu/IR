Abstract    :
              This project will investigate bidding strategies using agents which can buy
              goods and services from multiple auctions while satisfying user preferences and
              budgetary constraints. Of particular interest is the study and development of
              bundle bidding strategies, which will allow agents to put together preferred
              bundles of goods for users from online auctions selling only individual items.
              Automated bundle bidding procedures with well-understood performance
              expectations will allow users to form bundles with significantly less effort
              and much more success. The bundle bidding problem presents challenging and
              interesting research problems that involve asynchronous events, uncertainty
              about future auctions, and the widely varying valuations and bidding strategies
              of users and their proxies. Several variations of the bundle-bidding problem
              will be identified and studied. The project will also investigate the usage of
              auctions in conjunction with other forms of information processing within a
              broader context of coordination between self-interested autonomous agents
              representing individuals, organizations and supply chains.
