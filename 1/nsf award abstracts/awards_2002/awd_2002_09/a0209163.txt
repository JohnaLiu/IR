Abstract    :
              A comprehensive security architecture is proposed that uses language-based
              mechanisms to eliminate errors due to circumvention of type safety, be they
              intentional or erroneous, and that additionally uses security policy mechanisms
              to contain malicious behavior.  This approach extends techniques previously
              applied to mobile code and is based on a combination of a) mechanically
              verifying the absence of such errors in any software before it is run, using
              code representations that can be checked for such errors or that rule out
              errors in the first place, and b) monitoring executing software for malicious
              activity.

The proposed system consists of multiple layers, each of which is
              secured by the layer below it, the lowest of which can be provided in
              tamper-resistant hardware.  Key to the solution is to provide a typed hardware
              abstraction layer (THAL) that enables the construction of a type-safe system
              "from the ground up", all the way down to the tamper-proof hardware.  Hence,
              the goal is to build a practical system about which we can make security
              guarantees from the hardware up, and not just "from the operating system up".
