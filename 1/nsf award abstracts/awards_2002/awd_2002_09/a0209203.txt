Tomography, or the reconstruction
              of an object from a collection of its line integrals from various directions
              (known as its x-ray transform) is a well known problem. Perhaps most
              importantly, it is the principle underlying most of the key diagnostic imaging
              modalities including x-ray Computed Tomography (CT), PET and SPECT, certain
              forms of MRI, and emerging techniques such as electric impedance tomography
              (EIT) and optical tomography. Tomographic reconstruction is also widely used
              for nondestructive evaluation (NDE) in manufacturing, and has been recently
              proposed for safety screening of passenger luggage in airports. Tomography is
              also the fundamental principle in numerous other problems and applications in
              science and engineering  from electron microscopy of subcellular structures
              through geophysical exploration and environmental monitoring, to remote sensing
              by synthetic aperture radar (SAR).  In cone-beam tomography, projections are
              acquired by an area detector, using a source of divergent rays traveling on a
              one of several possible trajectories. It is already used in current PET and
              SPECT scanners and in NDE, and because it appears to be the only practical
              method for rapid volume acquisition, it will be the basis for the next
              generation of diagnostic CT scanners. This will allow to use CT as a dynamic
              imaging modality for cardiac imaging or for real-time surgical guidance in
              medicine, or as a high-throughput NDE system in manufacturing.
