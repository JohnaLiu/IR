Abstract    :
              This project involves laboratory and field studies to help elucidate the
              chemical mechanisms underlying ozone production and hydroxyl radical reactivity
              in the atmosphere.  This research includes intercomparison and development of
              instrumentation for measuring atmospheric free radicals, and studying the
              mixing ratios, loss rates and kinetics in urban, rural, and remote sites of the
              hydroxyl and the hydroperoxyl radicals.  The project will investigate the
              source of observed and evening and nighttime signals of these radicals, as well
              as develop and deploy detection capabilities for atmospheric free radicals.
