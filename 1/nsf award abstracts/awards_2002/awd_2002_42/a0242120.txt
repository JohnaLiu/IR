Abstract    :
              This award is made as a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER).  The
              theoretical research deals with quantum coherence in a variety of physical
              systems.  As such, the research may find application in quantum information
              sciences.  In addition, some of the systems to be considered have novel
              properties at the nanoscale.  The systems under investigation include possible
              phase transitions in cold confined Fermi gases and magnetic properties of small
              metal grains.  Also to be studied are superconducting grains and films.  The
              focus of these studies will be the clarification of theoretical issues that are
              impeding progress at the interface between theory and experiment.  

The work
              will be done in collaboration with groups at Birmingham in England and Munich
              in Germany, in addition to Cornell.
