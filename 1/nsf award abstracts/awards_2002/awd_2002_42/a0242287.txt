Abstract    :
              This project is an information exchange between research managers and
              policy-makers from several countries in the form of a workshop, held at the
              Fall Meeting of the Materials Research Society (MRS), in 2002. Mechanisms of
              governmental research funding will be highlighted, along with a description of
              the technical areas (related to materials) that are of interest, for each of
              the participating countries.  This information will form the basis of
              discussions of the mechanisms by which joint research programs can be created,
              in which funding is provided for the researchers principally by their own
              respective governments.  The workshop sessions will be open to the attendees of
              the MRS Fall Meeting, who will be active participants in the
              discussion.

Broader Impacts: It is anticipated that this project will result
              in improved articulation of research funding programs in different nations,
              significantly facilitating the creation of joint research programs in Materials
              Science & Engineering, between US-based researchers and those in other
              countries. It will encourage the creation of jointly-formulated proposals which
              allow the leveraging of research assets and expertise found diversely around
              the globe. The resulting experience with international collaborative research
              will form a strong basis for the extension of the models used here to all
              research subject areas supported by the various research agencies involved.
