Abstract    :
              
Framing effects are said to occur when "equivalent" redescriptions of objects
              or outcomes lead to different preferences or judgments.  For example, a medical
              treatment will be seen more favorably when described as resulting in "75%
              survival" rather than "25% mortality."  Such effects have traditionally been
              seen as irrational.  However, preliminary research conducted by the PI has
              shown that even logically equivalent attribute frames can implicitly convey, or
              "leak," normatively relevant information.  For instance, speakers were more
              likely to select the "75% survival" frame to describe a new treatment outcome
              if it led to a higher, rather than a lower, survival rate relative to an old
              treatment.  Moreover, listeners "absorbed" this leaked information: They were
              more likely to infer that the old treatment led to a lower survival rate when
              the new treatment was described in terms of % survival rather than % mortality.
               The objective of the proposed research is to deepen and broaden our
              understanding of the role of information leakage in framing effects.  Framing
              effects, rather than indicating irrational behavior, may instead indicate
              behavior that is rational, much richer, and more adaptive than previously
              thought.
