Abstract    :
              Under Phase I, BSCS has developed two semesters of instructional materials --
              one for grade nine and one for grade ten -- using an assessment-driven
              development process.  Classroom based field trials produced evidence that
              students had significant gains in student learning across different school
              settings and different ability groups.  BSCS also developed a curriculum
              framework for materials for grade 6-11 that addresses the National Science
              Education Standards.  Each year students learn fundamental concepts in life,
              Earth/space and physical science.  In addition, in each year, there is a short
              unit on scientific inquiry and a unit that presents the learner with a new
              context for applying understandings and integrating the sciences.  In this
              project BSCS completes the research based module development for grades nine
              and ten, and continues the work for grade eleven, so that the standards for
              high school science are addressed in a multidisciplinary approach that exposes
              students to both Earth/space science and physical science to greater depth than
              traditionally.  In addition to the student materials, annotated teacher
              editions and a teacher resource CDROM are developed.  A comprehensive teacher
              development guide for implementing multidisciplinary science is produced along
              with comprehensive implementation support for school districts.
