              Proposal 0242218
Group Travel Grant to 2003 IEEE International Conference on
              Robotics and Automation

The annual
              IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), sponsored by
              the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, is the best event in terms of quality
              and quantity in the areas of robotics and automation, and has served as a forum
              gathering international researchers for presentation and discussion of emerging
              technologies.  This project is to support about 45 U.S. researchers to
              participate in the 2003 ICRA that will be held in Taipei, Taiwan, May 12-17,
              2003.  The primary objective is to help U.S. researchers participate in this
              key international conference, who could not otherwise attend the Conference.
              U.S. researchers will maintain a highly competitive position in research by
              presenting research results, discussion, and exchange information with
              researchers from all over the world. This project strongly supports minority
              group researchers and students who would need financial support for their
              participation in the 2003 ICRA.
