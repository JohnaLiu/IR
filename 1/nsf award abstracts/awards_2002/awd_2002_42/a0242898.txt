Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is new methodology for the synthesis of
              enantiomerically pure organic phosphorous compounds.  The reactivity of
              hypophosphorous derivatives [ROP(OH)H] with several classes of organic
              electrophiles, with and without transition metal catalysts will be explored. 
              Phosphorous-carbon bond forming methods will be extended to other
              phosphinylidene-containing compounds (H-phosphonates and H-phosphinates). 
              Desymmetrization of organophosphorous compounds will be explored to provide
              enantiomerically pure P-chiral compounds.  Dr. Montchamp's educational focus is
              on the training of graduate and undergraduate students.

With this renewal
              award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
              research and educational efforts of Dr. Jean-Luc Montchamp in the Department of
              Chemistry at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, TX.  Professor Montchamp
              will focus his work on the development of chemical processes that can produce
              phosphorus-containing molecules that are either right- or left-handed.  The
              resulting "enantiomerically pure compounds" are expected to be of use in
              catalysis by chemical and pharmaceutical companies.  The educational activities
              of the award will enhance opportunities for training undergraduate and graduate
              chemistry students.
