Abstract    :
              The potential role of well-defined polymeric materials in a range or advanced
              technologies is becoming increasing apparent.  From microelectronics, sensors,
              drug delivery systems, catalysts, agents for chemical warfare detection and
              destruction, smart surfaces, to biodegradable tissue replacements, polymeric
              materials are the critical component or enabling technology for the successful
              implementation of these applications.   This conference will focus upon recent
              developments in the design and applications.  This conference will focus upon
              recent developments in the design and synthesis of polymeric materials,
              biodegradability, supramolecular chemistry and polymer physics.  Such an
              exchange of knowledge in these critical areas by world experts will provide a
              springboard for future developments as well as encouraging young scientists to
              join this growing field.

To encourage younger scientists to contribute to
              this blossoming field and its future directions specials emphasis will also be
              placed on their involvement.  We are requesting funds to supplement the travel
              costs for 10 postdoctoral fellows / students at $300 per person to attend the
              2003 Gordon Research Conference (Polymers East) to be held at Mount Holyoke
              College, June 15-20, 2003.  This amounts to a total request for $3000.00 in
              financial support.
