Abstract    :
              The objective of this study is to explore buoyant decompression melting as a
              mechanism for oceanic intraplate volcanism.  3D models will be used to explore
              buoyant melting in 3D, the statistics of populations of volcanoes that nucleate
              from small random initial disturbances in a broad, plate-scale mantle
              upwelling, and the effects of shearing due to plate motion.
