              ABSTRACT

Freedman, Richard
"NStars: Understanding the L-dwarfs and
              T-dwarfs"
AST-0086234

Dr. Freedman is producing a model spectral catalog
              for L-dwarf and T-dwarf stars.  Also known as 'brown dwarf stars,' such objects
              are below the hydrogen-burning limit for normal stars.  To facilitate the
              discovery of and subsequent follow-up research on brown dwarfs Dr. Freedman and
              colleagues are computing a library of high-resolution spectra covering the
              wavelength regime of 0.5-1000 micrometers appropriate for objects with
              effective temperatures ranging from 500-2200 K and metallicities ranging from
              -2 < [Fe/H] < 0.5.  The opacity of alkali metals and the influence of dusty
              condensates are included in the calculations.  The resulting model spectra are
              compared to observed spectra of L- and T-dwarfs over the full range of L- and
              T-dwarfs.  The results are distributed to the scientific community via the
              web.
Funding for this project was provided by the NSF Stellar Astronomy &
              Astrophysics  (AST/SAA) program through the joint NSF/NASA "Nearby Stars
              (NStars)" initiative, and the NSF Mathematical & Physical Sciences Directorate
              Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (MPS/OMA).
