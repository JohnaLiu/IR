Abstract    :
              This study will test the sensitivity of planktonic foraminifer assemblages to
              changes in the upper ocean environment in the North Atlantic gyre.  The study
              will compare time-series of species abundances in sediment trap samples
              collected in the long-term Ocean Flux Program at Bermuda.  Analyses of biweekly
              samples collected from 1989 to 2002 will be compared to hydrographic records
              from station S and biogeochemical data from the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series
              study (BATS).
