Abstract    :
              As jury trials have become increasingly complex, state and federal court systems
              have begun to implement innovations to the trial procedure aimed at improving
              jurors' understanding of evidence. For example, several state courts are now
              experimenting with allowing jurors to take notes or expanding preliminary
              instructions. Most research looking at the effects of such changes in courtroom
              procedure have been done at the level of the individual juror. Although several
              field studies have begun to assess how these innovations may affect jury
              functioning, there has been virtually no group-level experimental research in
              this area. This project tests how jury innovations might affect the process and
              outcome of jury deliberations.  Influential models of juror decision making
              tend to focus on individual- and not group-level processes.  Even models of
              jury decision making ignore the group process and predict group decisions
              solely from pre-deliberation verdict preferences.  Central to the research is a
              model of group-level reasoning and an in-depth analysis of group deliberations.
              Two goals of this study are to discover how changes in courtroom procedure may
              change the manner in which individual jurors process evidence and also how such
              changes affect how juries discuss the evidence. Results of this study,
              therefore, have implications for psychological theories of individual and group
              decision making, and should also prove valuable to federal and state court
              system policy makers as they consider implementing these changes.
