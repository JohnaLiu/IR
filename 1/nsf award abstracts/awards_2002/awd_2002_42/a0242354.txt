Abstract    :
              John Stanton of the University of Texas is supported by the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to develop and apply new theoretical methods
              for the treatment of radicals and biradicals.  The methods are based on
              coupled-cluster theory, which emphasizes highly accurate treatments, and the
              applications are transient molecular species, which require a balanced
              description of several electronic configurations.  In addition, models for the
              treatment of electronic spectra that involve nonadiabatic vibronic coupling
              effects will be developed, and accurate calculations of vibrational levels on
              excited state potential energy surfaces will be performed.

Radical species
              play a central role in many areas of chemistry, included organic chemistry,
              combustion processes, and atmospheric and interstellar chemistry.  The new
              techniques developed in this research project will allow extremely accurate and
              reliable predictions of the properties of these species.  Easy-to-use computer
              programs will be developed that incorporate these new techniques and that allow
              for future, routine application to related problems.
