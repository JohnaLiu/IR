Abstract    :
              This project consists of a series of workshops to be hosted jointly by the
              University of Minnesota and the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis during the
              summers of 2003, 2004 and 2005. Each workshop is one week long, concentrating
              on theoretical issues in macroeconomics and dynamic economic modeling. These
              workshops continue the series sponsored by the NSF at the University of
              Minnesota during 2000-02 and at Northwestern University during 1990-99.  
              Specific topics for the three years will vary, depending on research interests
              of the participants. Topics in recent years have included: monetary theory,
              searching and matching models of labor market dynamics, technical change and
              technology adoption, asset pricing, macroeconomic consequences of contracting
              frictions and financial market incompleteness, fiscal policy, business cycles,
              government policy in the absence of commitment, methods for analyzing models
              with heterogeneous agents, and political economy issues in the choice of
              aggregate policy. 

Intellectual Merit: This series has provided a valuable
              forum for researchers working on substantive and methodological issues in
              theoretical macroeconomics, broadly defined. It has provided both an outlet for
              the formal presentation and intensive discussion of recent papers and an
              opportunity for informal discussions outside the seminar room among researchers
              working in related areas. 

Broader Impact: The organizers have made a
              concerted effort to choose program committees each year that will reach a broad
              spectrum of theoretical macroeconomists, and the program committees have made a
              strong effort to identify and include young researchers. This workshop series
              is one of the few with an emphasis on the theoretical side of macroeconomics
              and dynamic economic modeling, and provides a useful opportunity for
              discussions among researchers representing somewhat distinct intellectual
              traditions.
