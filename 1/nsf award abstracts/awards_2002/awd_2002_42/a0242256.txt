The important interfacial
              properties of suspensions of colloidal crystals and liquids will be
              investigated. The interfacial behavior of suspensions is of central importance
              in many systems such as inks, paints and ceramics where the final product
              depends on wetting or interaction with a substrate. The primary goal is to
              understand how the phase behavior of a suspension influences its wetting and
              surface tension properties. These interfacial properties will be manipulated
              via an electric field to produce unique and controllable contact angles and
              wetting processes.  This is a program that combines colloid and surface
              science, statistical mechanics, electrodynamics and microfluidics. The study
              focuses on understanding the interplay between colloidal interactions,
              structure, and suspension interfacial phenomena. The work will be extended to
              use patterned electrodes to spatially modulate colloidal wetting processes. The
              spatially modulated electrocapillary behavior of colloidal suspensions will be
              exploited for interesting and novel microfluidic applications.
