Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the use of photochemical methods for the synthesis
              of organic compounds in the crystalline state.  Photodecarbonylation of
              aliphatic ketones to produce biradicals and the decomposition of diazo
              compounds is expected to lead to facile entry to cyclic compounds and singlet
              carbenes that are useful synthetic intermediates.  Mechanistic studies of the
              reaction pathways will shed light on radical dimerization and hydrogen
              abstraction processes in the solid state.  Dr. Garcia-Baribay's educational
              efforts focus on the training of graduate, undergraduate and post-doctoral
              chemists, many who come from non-traditional and disadvantaged
              backgrounds.

With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr.
              Miguel A. Garcia-Garibay in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at
              UCLA.  Professor Garcia-Garibay will focus his work on the development of
              chemical processes that can be performed in the solid state with light as a
              reagent. These processes will allow the synthesis of complex organic compounds
              without the use of solvents or heavy metals that can pollute the environment. 
              The resulting "green chemistry" is expected to be of use by pharmaceutical
              companies.  The educational activities of the award will enhance opportunities
              for women and Hispanic students at UCLA.
