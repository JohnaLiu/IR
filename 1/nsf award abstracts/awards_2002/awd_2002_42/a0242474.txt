This is a two-year dissertation enhancement project submitted
              by Dr. Kaiping Peng, and Julie Rodgers, Ph.D. student, University of California
              at Berkeley, in collaboration with Professors Lei Wang and Yubo Hou, Beijing
              University, to conduct three experiments on dialectical thinking, stereotyping
              and inter-group relations.  The proposed work addresses an important question
              on cultural differences in cognition science.   The award would support the
              career development of a Ph.D. student of promise and would support
              international collaborations that benefit research on culture and cognition. 
              This project is jointly supported by the National Science Foundation of China
              and NSF.
