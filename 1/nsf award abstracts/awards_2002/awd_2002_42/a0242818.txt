Abstract    :
              
In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program of the
              Chemistry Division, Zwier will conduct experimental research on the
              conformational preferences and isomerization dynamics of flexible biomolecules
              (dipeptide, tripeptide, triamide, and depsipeptide) cooled in a gas phase
              supersonic expansion.  These molecules are sufficiently large to have
              significant conformational complexity to bridge the gap between small molecules
              and the complexity of large ones such as proteins.  An ultraviolet chromophore
              will be incorporated in the molecules, thereby enabling sensitive detection via
              laser induced fluorescence or resonant two-photon ionization spectroscopy.  The
              dynamics of conformational isomerization will be studied with IR-UV hole
              filling spectroscopy and IR-induced population transfer spectroscopy.  

The
              results of this work will be applicable to problem of protein folding and may
              provide information about the laser control of molecular shape, with possible
              applications to a variety of areas including information storage.  Graduate and
              undergraduate students will participate in this research.  They will thereby
              acquire valuable experience in preparation for advanced studies or for entry
              into the scientific/technological workforce.
