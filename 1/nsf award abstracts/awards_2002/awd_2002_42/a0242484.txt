Abstract    :
              The focus of this research involves the development of new chiral catalysts. 
              Neutral and charged bi-,tri-, and tetra-dentate ligands will be used in
              conjunction with cationic copper (2+), tin (2+), aluminum (3+) and scandium
              (3+) metals in the generation of new families of chiral Lewis acids.  Reactions
              under consideration will include enantioselective carbonyl addition processes,
              particularly aldol and vinylogous aldol reaction variants, cycloaddition, and
              conjugate- and hetero-conjugate addition processes.  Catalysts will be
              developed that will implement both the enolization process and will moderate
              the subsequent electrophile-enolate bond construction with absolute
              stereochemical control.  Catalyst structure will be examined using X-ray
              crystallography.

With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry
              Program is supporting the research of Dr. David A. Evans  of the Department of
              Chemistry at the Harvard University.  Professor Evans will focus his work on
              using a combination of fundamental concepts in inorganic coordination chemistry
              with mechanistic principles in organic chemistry for the design of chiral
              metal-based complexes that function as catalysts for important families of
              carbon-carbon bond forming processes.  The project provides an excellent venue
              for the training of graduate students and the results of the research will have
              significant impact in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.
