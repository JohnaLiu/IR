Abstract    :
              In this project, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the
              Chemistry Division, the PI will pursue a broad program of research in
              State-to-State Reaction Dynamics.  The program consists of three main areas
              with several subtopics.  These are 1) Photofragmentation, including
              photodissociation and photoionization dynamics; 2) Hydrogen atom + Hydrogen
              molecule reaction dynamics.  This includes the investigation of scattering
              resonances, the development of improved apparatus, the investigation of the
              geometric phase in chemical reactions, and the study of the effects of
              vibrational excitation and angular momentum polarization; and 3) Using improved
              apparatus the impact of vibrational excitation on chemical reactivity will be
              investigated on small molecules, such as the reaction of chlorine atoms with
              methane and deuterated methane molecules in mode selected excited states, and
              studies of the vibrational control of larger molecules such as methyl alcohol
              and methyl amine and their deuterated variants through their reactions with
              chlorine atoms.  These projects will be done with the participation of students
              and postdoctoral research associates.  They will thereby acquire skills and
              knowledge in a forefront area of physical chemistry in preparation for advanced
              study or employment in industry, government laboratories or academia.
