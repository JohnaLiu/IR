Description:  This award is for support of a joint research
              project by Dr. Rafic Makki, Professor, Department of Electrical and Computer
              Engineering, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, and a team of
              scientists in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the American
              University of Beirut (AUB), including Dr. Ayman Kayssi, Dr. Ali Chehab and Dr.
              Ibrahim Hajj.  The research is to improve on the present design of sensors to
              make them process-variation and temperature tolerant.  These sensors are for
              on-chip testing of embedded memories and other mixed-signal circuits in deep
              sub-micron technologies.
 
Scope:  This award will add an international
              dimension to a current grant from the Division of Computer and Communications
              Research (CCR) to the PI.  The project provides funds for visits by two of the
              Lebanese scientists to UNC, Charlotte and a visit by the U.S. PI to AUB. It
              allows collaboration between the PI and three highly qualified Lebanese
              scientists in a country where collaboration has been at very low levels for
              many years.  Funding for this project is provided jointly by the Office of
              International Science and Engineering and the Division of Computer and
              Communications Research.
