Abstract    :
              This study examines the role of internal waves in mixing near source 
regions
              of internal waves by studying several different types of 
non-linear
              internal-wave interaction problems. Numerical experiments 
will be used to
              examine three different regimes.  The first will look 
at the nonlinear
              cascade of energy between short and long internal 
waves in a run-down
              experiment initialized with a high-energy, 
random-phase internal wave field
              with a spectrum similar to that 
postulated by Garrett and Munk.  The second
              set of experiments will 
look at energy transfer from internal waves at the
              frequency of the M2 
tide, forced by tidal excursions over topography, to
              higher frequency 
internal waves when that tranfer is catalyzed by the
              presence of a 
background field of internal waves.  The third focus is on
              interactions 
between wind-forced near-inertial waves and non-inertial
              internal waves.  
The numerical experiments will be conducted with a
              three-dimensional, 
non-hydrostatic, psuedospectral code.  The numerical
              results will be 
compared to field data collected during a variety of prior
              oceanic and 
coastal experiments.
