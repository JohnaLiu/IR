Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks support for students to attend the 14th Symposium on Global
              Change Studies, which will take place at the American Meteorological Society's
              83rd Annual Meeting in Long Beach, California, 9-13 February 2003.  The sum of
              $25,000 is required to defray the costs for approximately 25 graduate students
              to attend the Symposium and the other scientific conferences.  These travel
              scholarships have been offered at several AMS Annual Meetings, and have been
              enthusiastically received by the students and faculty.
