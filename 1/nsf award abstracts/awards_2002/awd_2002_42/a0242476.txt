Abstract    :
              The Education Development Center is developing "Mathematical Themes," a
              four-year high school mathematics curriculum organized along the more
              traditional lines of Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II and Pre-calculus. 
              Probability and statistics will be integrated into these courses.  The primary
              goal is to develop in students a robust mathematical proficiency as defined in
              "Adding It Up."  Mathematical proficiency is defined by the following
              characteristics:

*	Conceptual understanding:  comprehension of mathematical
              concepts, operations and relations.
*	Procedural fluency:  skill in carrying
              out procedures flexibly, accurately, efficiently and
              appropriately.
*	Strategic competence:  ability to formulate, represent and
              solve mathematical problems.
*	Adaptive reasoning:  capacity for logical
              thought, reflection, explanation and justification.
*	Productive disposition: 
              habitual inclination to see mathematics as sensible, useful and worthwhile,
              coupled with a belief in diligence and one's own efficacy.

The materials
              strike a balance between the common wisdom and tradition that students need to
              focus on one piece of mathematics at a time and what has been learned about the
              added value of seeing connections among mathematical topics and to fields
              outside mathematics.  The work builds on and makes use of materials developed
              with previous NSF support, namely:  "Connected Geometry" and "Mathematical
              Methods."
