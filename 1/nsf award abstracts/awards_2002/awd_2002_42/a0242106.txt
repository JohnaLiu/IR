Abstract    :
              The cultural theory of risk posits that individuals' worldviews decisively shape
              their assessments of what dangers are worthy of regulatory amelioration.  When
              evaluating competing claims and evidence, individuals naturally consider what
              crediting or discounting an asserted danger would convey about their society's
              values.  Previous studies have shown that differences over values explain
              public disagreements over myriad societal risks  from environmental catastrophe
              to foreign invasion to economic collapse.  These results have been used to
              develop procedures for resolving various disputes in which conflicting cultural
              values and conflicting factual beliefs reinforce one another.

The current
              study will use the cultural theory of risk to examine public attitudes toward
              guns.  The gun control debate features competing claims of risk: that
              insufficient regulation of guns will make citizens vulnerable to deliberate or
              accidental shootings, on the one hand; and that excessive regulation will leave
              citizens unable to defend themselves from attackers, on the other.  The
              hypothesis of this study is that cultural orientations determine which of these
              risk claims individuals are likely to take more seriously.  To test this
              hypothesis, the investigators will design and conduct a nationwide survey on
              cultural orientations and gun-risk perceptions.  They will also consider the
              implications of the cultural theory of risk perception for resolution of the
              gun control debate.
