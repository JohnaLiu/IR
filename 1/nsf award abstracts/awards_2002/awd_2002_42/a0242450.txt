This award supports a two-year collaborative research project
              between Professor Prabasaj Paul, with the Department of Physics and Astronomy
              at Colgate University, and Professor Daniel Nkemzi, with the Department of
              Physics at the University of Buea, in Cameroon.  They will investigate the
              application of Pade approximants to the problems of scattering of
              electromagnetic waves, and of photonic materials with maximal bandgaps. 
              

The problem of electromagnetic wave scattering from rough surfaces is
              important to many branches of physics and mathematics.  Using some powerful
              mathematical techniques, the multipoint Pade approximants, the two researchers
              will investigate the scattering of waves off uneven surfaces with very large
              roughness parameters, as well as the transmission of light through regions with
              a spatially varying refractive index.  The Pade approximants of the scattering
              matrix will preserve two important properties, reciprocity and unitarity.  The
              investigators expect their model to yield better results than existing
              mathematical models that are based on a classical perturbation series.  The
              study combines Professor Paul's expertise in condensed matter and quantum
              physics with Professor Nkemzi's knowledge of applied mathematics, principally
              in wave propagation.

The results are expected to add new knowledge about
              wave scattering from rough surfaces, and will have application to many areas of
              mathematics and physics.
