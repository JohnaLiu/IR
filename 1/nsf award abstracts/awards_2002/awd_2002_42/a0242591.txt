Wavelets represent a new mathematical tool, developed mostly
              over the last 
fifteen years. The fundamental strength of wavelets lies in its
              inherent ability 
to achieve very high resolution locally using relatively few
              localized functions, called wavelets. However, its application in solid-earth
              geophysics has remained relatively limited. In this three-year proposal a
              multidisciplinary team, steeped in the skills of applied mathematics, numerical
              analysis, fluid dynamics and theoretical 
geophysics, will employ the latest
              tools from wavelets to address two classes of 
geophysical problems.  These
              include finite-amplitude viscoelastic deformation in strongly variable
              viscosity media where thermo-mechanical coupling and mechanical compaction play
              mutually interacting roles, and modeling of gravity currents in both 2D and 3D
              geometries with strong thermo-mechanical coupling from variable viscosity and
              viscous heating. The aim is to disseminate the use of wavelets to the
              geophysical community in frontier research and basic education of graduate and
              undergraduate students.
