Abstract    :
              This project will develop a technique for predicting the energization of solar
              wind ions in the Earth's bow shock and the trasport of the energized ions into
              the magnetosphere.  The project can be divided into 5 objectives: (1) determine
              how wolar wind ions are energized at the quasi-parallel bow shock, (2) map the
              connection from the quasi-parallel shock to the magnetospheric cusp and the
              ionospheric footprint of the cusp, (3) determine how the energized ions are
              transported from the shock region into the cusp, (4) determine the impact the
              accelerated ions have on the ionosphere as a function of solar wind conditions
              and the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field, and (5) develop a
              technique for predicting energetic ions in the cusp based on solar wind
              conditions.  The project will utilize data from a variety of satellites and
              will include a collaboration with Slovak scientist, Dr. K. Kudela, who will
              help with the access and interpretation of data from the Interball satellite. 
              Three-dimensional hybrid simulations will be used to model the shock heating
              and transport processes and the model results will be compared with the
              satellite data.
