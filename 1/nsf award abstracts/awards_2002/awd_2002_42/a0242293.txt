Title:  REU Site - Research Experiences in Computer Science for
              Students at Undergraduate Institutions

The project directly impacts
              twenty-four students (eight during each of three summers) by giving them
              first-hand experience with several of the most rewarding  activities  that 
              characterize  graduate  study  and  research careers.  These  activities 
              include: conducting research as part of a team, disseminating results, and
              participating in a community of scholars.  Students have access to DePauw
              University's computing facilities, including a pen-based computing
              collaboratory that facilitates the study of multiple machine interfaces.  This
              Collaboratory was recently enhanced with a NSF MRI grant and houses a 72"
              diagonal touch-sensitive electronic whiteboard,  four  61"  diagonal 
              touch-sensitive plasma displays, and  twenty  Pentium  student stations that
              use pen-based video tablets as their primary input device.  The grant is also
              funding a display server, six  handheld  Windows-CE computers,  and a database
              server  for  experimentation with  wireless database access.  The program is
              geared toward students enrolled at undergraduate institutions who have had
              little exposure to graduate departments. 

The research projects are drawn
              from a number of fields of Computer Science including  Text  Summarization, 
              Wireless  Database  Access, Multiple Machine  Interfaces,  Programming Language
              Pedagogy, and Assistive Technology.
