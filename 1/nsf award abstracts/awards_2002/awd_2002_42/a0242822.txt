CISE RI: A
              Networked Computing Environment for the Manipulation and Visualization of
              Geometric Data 


This project, enabling the RI/MII PI Workshop, strengthens
              the national computing infrastructure by supporting exchanges on infrastructure
              development needs of research. The meeting serves to judge the effectiveness of
              the awarded infrastructure and awarded research carried upon such
              infrastructure, as well as their impact on research and education. Facilitating
              face-to-face contacts and exchanges of ideas, the conference serves as a tool
              for the principal investigators to judge their own work and that of others
              awarded. In addition to research exchange, often the PIs gain insights as to
              where to recommend students to pursue graduate studies and even what
              universities to apply that best might service their new PhD degree, and
              alternately, where their research might have the most influence.
