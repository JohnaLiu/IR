              ABSTRACT

OCE-0242065





Breaking ocean waves are critically important
              in many near-surface processes sucha as mixing, the generation of currents, 
              the flux of mass heat, momentum and gases. This project will use bioluminescent
              dinoflagellates as microscopic sensors  responsive to fluid shear stress to
              make quantitative measurements of time-evolving fluid shear stress and energy
              dissipation inside a breaking wave crest. The measurements will be made in
              laboratory breaking waves and then these measurements will be incorporated into
              existing model of air entrainment mechanisms in breaking waves.  Undergraduate
              students will be active participants in the experiments and the data analysis.
              In addition, outreach activities are planned.
