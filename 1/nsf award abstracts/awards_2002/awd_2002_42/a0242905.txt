Abstract    :
              This is a continued investigation of the total motion between Nubia and Somalia
              inferred from the data flanking the Southwest Indian Ridge. The implications of
              this motion for global plate motion circuits will also be investigated.  The
              critical task that remains is to determine the total relative motion thought to
              have begun 30-25 million years ago.  Two key magnetics anomalies (13y and 21o)
              from seafloor formed on the Southeast Indian Ridge before 30 Ma will be
              analyzed.
