Conference `Advances in Constructive Approximation'


The
              proposal is primarily for the support of graduate students and 
recent Ph.D.'s
              to participate in the international
conference "Advances in Constructive
              Approximation," which
will be held May 14 -17, 2003 at Vanderbilt
              University.
The general theme of the meeting concerns the interactions
of
              approximation theory with several areas of classical,
functional, and
              numerical analysis, with applications to
data fitting, computer-aided
              geometric design, wavelets
and signal processing. The conference is expected
              to
attract a good mix of academic, industrial, and
              government
researchers.

The estimated attendance is about 120.
