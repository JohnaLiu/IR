The objective of
              the proposed research is to synthesize and characterize novel micas for use as
              cation-exchange materials.  In previous work, micas with both tetrahedral and
              octahedral negative charge were synthesized.  The location of the charge is
              expected to have implications for capacity as well as selectivity of ions.  In
              the present work fundamental cation-exchange and equilibria in sodium-based
              mica exchangers with both tetrahedral and octahedral negative charges will be
              investigated.  Exchange kinetics and equilibria involving ions such as cesium,
              strontium, barium, radium, copper, nickel, and zinc will be investigated. 
              Micas will be characterized using X-ray powder diffraction, infrared absorption
              spectroscopy, differential thermal analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. 
              In terms of the broader impacts, the studies may lead to applications in metal
              recovery, catalysis, and wastewater treatment.  Because micas are stable
              structures, they are candidates for use in remediation of sites contaminated by
              radioactive species.  The educational component will involve the normal
              mentorin
