Abstract    :
              This project will create a textbook with integrated laboratory, field and
              classroom activities, teacher guide and a teacher professional development
              guide to support the teaching of an environmental science course for grade
              10-12.  The materials will be designed for a course that has a focus on the
              relationship between humans and their geological surroundings.  A learning
              cycle pedagogical design will be used to help students develop concept
              understandings and skills through concept exploration, development and
              application phases.  Concept application will feature student-driven inquiry
              into environmental issues that require application of geological, geographical
              and technological understandings and tools.  Embedded and performance-based
              assessments will elicit students' conceptual understanding of core
              environmental and earth systems concepts, unifying concepts and processes,
              applications of technology to societal problems and the nature of science and
              technology.  Print materials for each unit will integrate application of USGS
              global GIS data sets and tools to student research.  Appropriate supplemental
              web content will be provided to enhance teachers' understanding of science
              content, facilitate data acquisition and support student inquiry.
