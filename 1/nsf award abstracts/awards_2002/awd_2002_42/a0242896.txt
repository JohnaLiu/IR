Abstract    :
              The investigators will study the effects of gravity wave packets on the chemical
              exothermic heating in the mesopause region.  Chemical exothermic heating is an
              important heat source in the mesopause region, and there is much evidence that
              gravity waves interact with hydroxyl nightglow emissions.  A detailed,
              time-dependent study including fully nonlinear chemistry required to understand
              and quantify these wave effects has yet to be performed.  The investigators
              will use state of the art models specifically designed for these tasks,
              including the Spectral Full-Wave Model, which simulates a time-dependent
              gravity wave packet, and a time-dependent, nonlinear, 2-D chemistry model that
              solves the coupled continuity equations of chemically active minor species. 
              Hydroxyl chemistry will be included in the modeling to better understand the
              complex interplay between dynamics and airglow emissions.  The main thrust of
              the research will be to understand the forcing of the mean state minor species
              distributions and associated chemical exothermic heating due to waves.  The
              results are relevant to global climate modeling used to study the effects of
              global change on the middle atmosphere.
