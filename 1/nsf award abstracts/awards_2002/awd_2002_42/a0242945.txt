              Project Summary: Plasticity of Neural Integrator Dynamics

 The oculomotor
              neural integrator converts brief input signals for rapid eye movements into
              sustained patterns of neural activity that maintain tension in eye muscles to
              hold the eye at a fixed angular position. The leading candidate mechanism for
              the production of this sustained activity is re-excitation of neurons through
              recurrent feedback loops, a mechanism that requires precise tuning of the
              amount of positive feedback for proper operation.  Normally, visual signals
              produce the appropriate amount of tuning by changing the properties of the
              sustained activity in the neural integrator. Experimentally, the plasticity
              will be artificially controlled  by a training paradigm consisting of a visual
              pattern rotating with an angular velocity dynamically controlled in real time
              by eye position.  Optimal training protocols will be established and changes in
              the properties of neurons in the neural integrator will be quantitatively
              measured. These data will be used to incorporate learning rules into
              theoretical recurrent neural network models of the neural integrator.  The
              conversion of a transient input into a sustained neural output is a form of
              short term memory that is widely observed in the nervous system. Thus better
              understanding of the role tuning mechanisms contribute to neural integrator
              function should have broader significance in neurobiology.
