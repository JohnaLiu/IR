Abstract    :
              Understanding the basis of gene expression is vital if researchers are to
              dissect the complex biology of living organisms.  The Bacillus cereus group
              represents a diverse collection of bacteria capable of living in a range of
              habitats and infecting a range of hosts.  Spontaneously occurring phenotypic
              variants are being isolated and characterized with a view to providing insights
              into how these organisms regulate gene expression.  A combination of
              traditional microbiological techniques coupled with DNA-based micro-array
              technology will be employed to uncover the basis of each variant providing
              fundamental data of value to researchers working in this area.
