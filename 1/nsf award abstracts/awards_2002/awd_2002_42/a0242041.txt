Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research are to better understand the magnitude, depth
              and timing of changes in upper intermediate waters off southern California in
              relation to decadal to millennial scale climate change and test the
              relationship of changes along the California margin to global climate signals
              associated with deglaciation events of the late Quaternary.  The hypothesis
              that tropical changes preceded high-latitude changes will be tested by
              comparing records of ventilation changes in intermediate waters with surface
              water records.  The study will focus on well known transitions and intervals of
              rapid climate change, such as Terminations 1A and 1B and interstadials 3, 4,
              and 5.  Multiproxy analyses, including stable isotope analyses of benthic and
              planktic foraminifers, Mg/Ca analyses of benthic and planktic foraminifers and
              coiling ratios of selected planktic foraminifers will be done at decadal-scale
              resolution across the critical intervals in piston cores recovered from the
              Santa Barbara Basin.
