This dissertation research by an anthropology
              graduate student asks: 'How does culture interact with the innate psychological
              mechanisms that produce ethnocentrism?', and 'Why does adherence to in-group
              ideology increase in times of danger?'  The project seeks to explain why people
              adhere to and tenaciously defend their worldviews. It tests the proposition
              that inclusion in cooperative ventures is premised on predictability, and
              predictability is a function of commonality in cultural values, therefore
              displays of ethnocentrism are tantamount to advertisements intended to recruit
              coalitional support from in-group members in times of need. Research will be
              conducted in two regions, urban Southern California and rural Costa Rica. 
              These cultures differ along the dimension of individualism/collectivism, a
              factor predicted to influence the salience of different forms of threat. 
              Investigations will combine qualitative ethnographic approaches with controlled
              psychological experiments to explore how culture, ideology, and individual
              differences in personality affect how people evaluate in-groups and out-groups
              in times of threat or social conflict. 
Broader impacts: The terrorist attacks
              of 9/11 as well as many of the genocidal wars of the last decade revolve around
              differences in worldviews, which manifest as violent ethnocentrism. By
              elucidating the psychological mechanisms that generate ethnocentrism and the
              cultural factors that exacerbate it, this project may provide diplomats, policy
              makers, and defense analysts with a firmer foundation on which to make
              decisions in the effort to avoid, ameliorate, or end violent conflicts that
              stem from cultural differences.
