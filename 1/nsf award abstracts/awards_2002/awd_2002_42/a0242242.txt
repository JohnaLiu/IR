SGER: A Toolset
              for Making Web Sites Accessible to Aging Adults in a Multicultural
              Enviornment

As US citizens becomes more reliant on the Web as a primary
              source of information, we must ensure that all have accessibility to that
              information in formats that are useful and usable.  This becomes an issue in
              the US, with its growing elderly population.  This grant is to develop and
              explore the usefulness and capability of automated tools to assist government
              agencies in determining accessibility for the elderly and to develop metrics by
              which such accessibility can be measured.
