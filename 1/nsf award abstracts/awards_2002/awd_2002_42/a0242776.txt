This project will expand dissertation research on
              the circumstances leading to cheating in mutualistic interactions by testing
              explicit hypotheses on geographically structured coevolution and history.  The
              obligate pollination mutualism between yuccas and yucca moths is one of the
              classical examples of coevolution, and an excellent model system to explore
              mutualism reversal as it includes derived non-pollinating 'cheater' moths. 
              Using this interaction, three specific predictions will be tested on how local
              adaptation drives variation in plant-moth interactions and coevolution.  The
              project will specifically focus on phylogeography and floral morphology of the
              host plant Yucca filamentosa.  Phylogeographic analysis based on AFLP data will
              be performed across the plant range, and the results used to test hypotheses
              that involve comparisons with existing data sets on floral trait variation and
              moth phylogeographic patterns.  This study will provide one of the first data
              sets to extract both the historical and adaptive components of a mutualism.
