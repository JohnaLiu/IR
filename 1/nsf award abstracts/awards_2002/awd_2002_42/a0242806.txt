Abstract    :
              The award provides travel support for U.S. and foreign students and postdoctoral
              researchers to attend the Seventh International Conference on Southern
              Hemisphere Meteorology and Oceanography (7ICSHMO), to be held in Wellington,
              New Zealand from March 24-28, 2003.  The award will be administered by the
              American Meteorological Society (Dr. Ron McPherson, Exective Director), and
              will provide travel assistance to young researchers who would otherwise be
              unable to attend the meeting.  The conference themes include a) Southern oceans
              and air-sea interaction, 2) Atmospheric chemistry in the Southern Hemisphere,
              3) Tropical-extratropical interactions and teleconnections in the Southern
              Hemisphere, 4) Role of cryosphere in southern climate, 5) South American
              monsoon, and 6) Southern climate and society issues.  The 7ICSHMO meeting will
              be held at the Te Papa National Museum of New Zealand, in Wellington.  The lead
              organizers of the workshop are Dr. George Kiladis (NOAA Aeronomy, Boulder) and
              Dr. Jim Renwick (National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research, New
              Zealand. The workshop format includes 5 keynote talks:  Kevin Trenberth (USA,
              NCAR Climate and Global Dynamics Division); Chris Folland (UK, British
              Meteorological Office), Stephen Rintoul (Australia, CSIRO Division of
              Oceanography), Dean Roemmich (USA, Scripps Institution of Oceanography), Per
              Nyberg (USA, Cray Research), and possibly, Anne Thompson (USA, NASA/GSFC).  The
              5-day meeting will run two parallel sessions, and the 16-member strong program
              committee comprising of leading scientists from the United States, Brazil,
              Botswana, New Zealand, Australia, and Argentina, has put together exciting
              sessions for the benefit of mainstream researchers as well as graduate students
              and post-docs.  The meeting program is available from the conference web-site
              (http://metsoc.rsnz.org/7icshmo/index2.html).
