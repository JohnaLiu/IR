Abstract    :
              The Rocky Mountain Biological Lab (RMBL) hosts 10 students each summer to
              participate in our Research Experience for Undergraduate Program.  The program
              is open to all undergraduate students, and stipends, room, board and travel are
              provided.  Students conduct field research in ecology and evolutionary biology
              under the supervision of a senior scientist.  The focus of the program is to
              help students, particularly students from underrepresented groups, consider and
              pursue a career in field biology.  The primary emphasis of the program is an
              independent research project that students design and conduct under the
              guidance of a scientist at the RMBL.  To assist both mentors and students, the
              RMBL conducts workshops in experimental design and statistical analysis.  Upon
              completion of projects, all students in the REU program communicate their
              results orally at a summer-end symposium.  Students are also required to place
              a paper written in the scientific format on file with the RMBL.  We strongly
              encourage students to submit their papers to our online, peer-reviewed journal
              Undergraduate Research in Behavior, Ecology, and Evolution.  Students
              interested in the RMBL's REU program should contact Dr. Ian Billick
              (director@rmbl.org, (970) 349-7231).  Information is also available online at
              www.rmbl.org
