Abstract    :
              The Scientific Committee on Solar-Terrestrial Physics (SCOSTEP) was formed as a
              scientific committee under the International Council of Scientific Unions
              (ICSU) in 1978.  It is charged with the long-term responsibility to promote
              international interdisciplinary programs, to facilitate cross-project
              cooperation, to organize cross-disciplinary conferences, and to enhance
              multi-national research collaborations, with the scientific goal of advancing
              quantitative understanding of coupling mechanisms responsible for the transfer
              of mass, momentum and energy throughout the solar-terrestrial system.  The
              attendant broader impact of these activities is to improve the predictability
              of the effects of the variable components of solar energy and interplanetary
              disturbances on the terrestrial environment.
