Abstract    :
              The International Society for Risk Analysis ("SRA") has begun the groundwork for
              a series of World Congresses on Risk Analysis in the 21st century.  In
              partnership with other scientific, governmental and professional organizations
              interested in risk, SRA is launching the first of this series in 2003.  The
              First World Congress will be held at the Sheraton Brussels, June 22-25, 2003.
              

The unifying theme for the First World Congress is "Risk and Governance,"
              which reflects the worldwide trend toward making better use of risk-oriented
              concepts, tools, and processes (derived from both research and practice) in
              public decision making and risk management. Specific objectives of the First
              World Congress are to (1) stimulate dialogue on emerging risk issues of
              worldwide interest, (2) share insights about analytic methods and decision
              processes used in different regions of the world, (3) demonstrate and
              disseminate recent advances in risk assessment, management, and communication,
              and (4) build an organized, international community of individuals dedicated to
              advancing the state of the art and promoting appropriate use of risk-related
              tools, concepts, and procedures. 

To ensure broad participation by various
              critical communities and decision makers interested in risk analysis at the
              First World Congress, SRA will use support from the National Science Foundation
              to provide travel stipends in three key areas:

1.	Travel and lodging support
              for plenary speakers, breakout leaders, and rapporteurs;  
2.	Travel and
              lodging stipends for participants from developing countries and Central and
              Eastern European countries; and
3.	Travel and lodging stipends for junior
              faculty or researchers.
