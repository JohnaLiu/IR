Abstract    :
              Prof. Baxter and his colleagues have proposed (in a group of separate proposals)
              to construct a Low Energy Neutron Scattering (LENS) facility at Indiana
              University.  If constructed, this facility would have the potential for
              significant impact on neutron scattering in the United States: (1) It would
              help train the next generation of scientists who will use the Spallation
              Neutron Source.  (2) It would provide a test facility for the development of
              neutron-scattering instrumentation.  (3) It would provide an exploratory
              research tool for new scientific problems in soft condensed matter and biology
              that are inappropriate for tightly scheduled, large user facilities.

The
              purpose of the present proposal is to provide the Principal Investigators with
              support for continuing design and engineering studies while they are awaiting
              the review of the final proposal needed to begin the construction of LENS.
