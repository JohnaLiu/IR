Abstract    :
              This project will aid in the publication and distribution of a journal devoted
              to research on space weather and the transition of research results to
              practical applications. The journal, Space Weather: The International Journal
              of Research and Applications, is published by the American Geophysical Union
              (AGU) and is designed to foster the transfer of space weather research to
              applications. It will enhance the communication between researchers,
              forecasters, and users of space weather data.
