Description:  This award supports a cooperative research
              project between Dr. Philip Garner, Department of Chemistry, Case Western
              Reserve University (CWRU), Cleveland, Ohio, and Dr. Ozdemir Dogan, Department
              of Chemistry, Middle East Technical University (METU), Ankara, Turkey.  The
              objective of this joint project is to develop an effective catalytic asymmetric
              reaction for the synthesis of pure pyrrolidines.  The development of means of
              preparation of substituted pyrrolidines in high purity would be a major
              achievement, as the pyrrolidine substructures are found in many bioactive
              natural products and synthetic drug structures.  
  
Scope:  Part of the
              catalyst development work will be conducted in the U.S. by Hasan Koyuncu, who
              is a Turkish graduate student in the Dogan group.  He will spend three months
              each year in the Garner laboratory, and his work will be part of his Ph.D.
              thesis with Professor Garner acting as Mr. Koyuncu's co-advisor.  This
              experience abroad will contribute to his professional development.  The visits
              by Dogan and Garner to each other's laboratories will be used for group
              discussions relating to the project, and for departmental seminars. These
              activities will foster the growing research interactions between METU and CWRU.
               The project is funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering
              and the Division of Chemistry.
