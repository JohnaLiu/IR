Abstract    :
              This symposium is on "Increasing U.S. participation in the 2nd International
              Steroids and Nervous System Conference".  This conference will update our
              current knowledge by describing new research on the relationships of steroid
              hormones synthesized in different organs and the nervous system.  Participants
              in this program will include undergraduate students, graduate students,
              post-doctoral fellows, and faculty. The symposium will engage participants in
              discussions regarding novel aspects of glucocorticoids and mineralcorticoids,
              non-classical mechanisms of steroid action, steroid regulation of reproduction,
              glial cells as targets for steroids, and the behavioral effects of steroids.
              Symposia, poster presentations, meet the professor lunches, and organized
              discussions on international research opportunities will encourage interactions
              between students, junior scientists, and senior scientists that are
              internationally recognized for their accomplishments. The organizing committee
              is committed to fostering the development of young scientists. Funds will help
              defray travel costs for participants to attend the meeting.
	The impact of
              this will extend to numerous fields of study, such as neuroendocrinology,
              behavioral neuroscience, animal behavior, and population biology. This meeting
              is a follow-up to the 1st International Meeting on Steroids and the Nervous
              System (NSF Supported), which was an unqualified success. Proceedings from the
              present meeting will be published as an issue of The Annals of the New York
              Academy of Sciences.
