Abstract    :
              Networked computer systems are vulnerable to malicious attack. These
              attacks
try to take over the control of a victim computer system by
              re-pointing the processor program counter (PC) to the attacker's code.  This
              proposal explores a role for security aware compilation and processor
              microarchitecture in preventing unauthorized PC modifications.  The two most
              common instances of PC compromise arise from the corruption of (1) the return
              address in an activation record and (2) function pointers.  The basic approach
              to guarding PC is to apply an encoding function before any potential PC value
              (such as return address, or function pointer table entry) is stored in any
              memory location (such as a stack frame or function pointer table in the data or
              heap space). 

Any read of a memory value into the PC first has to go through
              a decoding function. A compromised PC value would go only through the decoding
              function and hence would render the malicious attack ineffective.  This
              research investigates several variations of PC encoding/decoding schemes and
              evaluates computational overhead of these schemes and their effectiveness. 
              This research plans to build a hardened Linux system, gcc compiler and other
              public domain utilities such as Apache web server incorporating the proposed
              return address and function pointer protection schemes.
