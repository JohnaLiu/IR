Abstract    :
              The Simplot Decision Support Center (SDSC, 1991) and National Information
              Assurance Training and Education Center (NIATEC, 1999), components of Idaho
              State University's College of Business were established in response to the
              overwhelming need for computer-related security education and research. In May
              1999 the NSA designated the Idaho State University one of the initial seven
              Centers of Excellence in Information Assurance Education. This project will
              expand the Center's current role in relieving the shortage of qualified
              information assurance personnel by providing financial support through NSF's
              Federal Cyber Service: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program for 30
              graduate/undergraduate students as participants in a rigorous academic program.
              The highlights of Idaho State University's program are:  
__ Faculty committed
              to working with undergraduates in a training and education environment to
              support an ongoing research program.  
__ Immediate integration of students in
              existing research programs in information assurance  
__ A Cyber Research
              Seminar emphasizing critical thinking, leadership, and communication skills 
              
__ Expanding Horizons Seminars presented by experts in the field of
              information assurance  
__ An ethics component, in the form of an integrated
              sequence of lectures and discussion.  
__ Development of professional skills
              through mentoring, training, and experience.  
__ Service, as coordinated by
              the federal Office of Personnel Management (OPM), to give students the
              opportunity to serve by solving specific real problems in information
              assurance.
