This award supports the US-India collaborative research
              project entitled Studies of the Vortex State vis-'a-vis d-wave
              Superconductivity in Epitaxial Films of La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO).  US PI Richard
              Greene of the Center for Superconductivity Research  (CSR), University of
              Maryland and Ramesh C. Budhani of the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur
              (IITK) propose to study vortex dynamics and quasiparticle tunneling in the
              vortex state of LSCO epitaxial films.  High quality and oriented epitaxial
              films of LSCO deposited with the technique of pulsed laser ablation will be
              used for measurements of vortex dynamics and tunneling.  While vortex dynamics
              will be addressed at the IITK, measurements of tunneling will be undertaken at
              the University of Maryland.  This research draws strengths from the
              state-of-the-art research facilities at each institution and decades of
              experience of the investigators in the field of superconductivity.  The
              existing synergy between the two groups will facilitate realization of the
              stated research objectives.
