Abstract    :
              Present models of mid-ocean ridge spreading processes fail to explain some major
              features, such as narrow axial highs.  This failure stems from not considering
              magmatic loading of the near axis region and form not focusing on that region
              with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution in numerical models.  New
              conceptual models for narrow high and axial summit troughs are suggested
              involving periodic collapse of thin axial lithosphere under the weight of
              magmatic loads.  New model predictions will be tested against data on fault
              patterns associated with narrow axial highs, the distribution of axial summit
              troughs, the age distribution of lava flows as a function of shape of the axis,
              and the degree of rotation of sections of fast-spreading crust seen in tectonic
              windows.
