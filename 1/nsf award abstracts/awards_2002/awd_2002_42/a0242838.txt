Abstract    :
              This Planning Grant will enable the Ohio State University to  address the
              shortage of professional engineers in the United States by designing an
              engineering curriculum for dissemination through the 4-H system. Planning
              activities include the establishment of a nationwide advisory committee,
              solicitation of input from the target audience via focus groups and the
              development of a plan for the curriculum and its content, designed to address
              the needs of young women and underserved groups.  Pilot testing of sample units
              will occur in Ohio, Louisiana and Indiana.  A recruitment plan will also be
              developed to aide with national dissemination.
