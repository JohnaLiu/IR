Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks funding to support minority-serving higher education
              institutions and schools develop competitive proposals for the Math and Science
              Partnerships.  During the Fall of 2002, four workshops will be held.  Teams
              will be invited to participate where the partnering higher education
              institution is  recognized as an Hispanic Serving Institution, Tribal College,
              Historically Black College or University, or other minority-serving
              institution.  These two-day workshops will focus on helping teams develop and
              refine their plans for a comprehensive or targeted MSP project. Particular
              emphasis will be placed on forming strong partnerships, developing a highly
              qualified teacher workforce, implementing a challenging curriculum and
              designing a rigorous evaluation.  After the next round of MSP awards are made,
              QEM will hold a one-day workshop that will focus on next steps, either program
              implementation for successful projects or revisions of proposals for
              non-awarded projects.
