Abstract    :
              This is a continuation of investigations of the kinematics, rheology, and
              dynamics of diffuse oceanic plate boundaries.  Diffuse plate boundaries are
              100's to 1000's of kilometers in across-strike width, occur in both oceanic and
              continental lithosphere, cover 15% of Earth's surface, and accommodate relative
              plate motion of up to 15 mm/year.  The project will estimate torques from
              angular velocities for various plate pairs, fit the deformation profiles across
              the Central Indain Basin to obtain more precise estimates of the rheology, and
              use the results to quantify with simple physics the strength of faults for some
              diffuse plate boundaries.
