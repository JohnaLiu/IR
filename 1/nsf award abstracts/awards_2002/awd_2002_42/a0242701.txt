Abstract    :
              The Molecular Logic project is designed to improve the ability of all students
              to understand fundamental biological phenomena in terms of the interactions of
              atoms and molecules.  The project does this by enhancing biology courses with
              guided explorations of powerful atomic and molecular computational models. 
              These models are embedded in eight modules that are linked both to standards
              and to typical textbooks, and they are easily implemented in diverse
              educational settings.

The models are designed to cover basic science
              concepts using an approach that is accurate, grade-appropriate, and accessible
              to students with different learning styles.  Exploration of the models requires
              problem solving and fosters critical thinking.  Collaboration around
              model-based challenges is used to strengthen student communication skills.  The
              associated materials provide connections to technology, engineering, social
              questions and scientists.

Computational models are central to the project. 
              The models are also available at no cost online as hybrid materials that
              include text and additional computational resources.  Student assessment is
              embedded.  Teacher professional development and ongoing support are provided
              online.  An advisory board of scientists, teachers and researchers helps
              oversee and guide the project.
