Abstract    :
              The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Virtual Proving
              Ground Simulation will focus unique capabilities and facilities for vehicle
              system simulation at the University of Iowa and electromechanical system
              simulation and design at the University of Texas at Austin on the goal of
              creating fundamental new capabilities for virtual proving ground simulation of
              complex vehicle and equipment systems, including off-road equipment,
              hybrid-electric vehicles, and next-generation enhanced vehicle mobility and
              vehicle power systems.

The I/UCRC will create and make available to its
              members an internationally unique virtual proving ground using (1)
              state-of-the-art networked computing facilities for high fidelity engineering
              simulation, (2) the National Advanced Driving Simulator at Iowa for
              driver-in-the-loop virtual proving ground simulation, and (3) unique
              capabilities at UT-Ausgtin, including access to facilities at the Center for
              Electromechanics.  With these assets and significant extensions to be developed
              in the proposed research program, the I/UCRC will support its members with
              internationally unique modeling , analysis, and virtual prototyping
              capabilities for simulation of complex vehicle and equipment systems.
