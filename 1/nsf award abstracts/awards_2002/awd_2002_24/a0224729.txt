The main goal of this research project is to develop a
              comprehensive
framework for dynamical state estimation, fault detection and
              fault
accommodation in energy processing systems.  Such systems
              include
terrestrial and autonomous power systems, electric drives and
              power
electronic systems, and can be found in both civilian and
              military
sectors.

The PI's approach is based on a  family of experimentally
              verifiable and
mutually consistent dynamic models, with various family members
              being
suitable for different tasks in analysis, fault management and
control.
              In addition to exploring hierarchical and distributed
architectures for
              monitoring and accommodating for faults in energy processing
systems, he will
              also study simulation environments in which multiple
models with embedded
              redundant dynamics are used to detect
inconsistencies, and to initiate more
              detailed  simulations to resolve
them. He will also study economic and
              environmental aspects of fault
tolerance in energy processing systems.
