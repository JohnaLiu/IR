With the
              help of the Electron Spin Resonance Spectrometer (ESR) instrument acquired
              previously, the principal investigators have been able to establish techniques
              for probing polymer and surfactant layers at solid-liquid interfaces. Results
              of these studies have already provided some new information on the nature of
              the adsorbed microstructures. ESR spectroscopy, in conjunction with other
              techniques, has proved to be a powerful tool for studying molecular mechanisms
              of adsorption. The purchase of the Bruker EMX 6/1 HX ESR will enable them to
              analyze directly in-situ the nanostructue conformation and orientation of
              polymers and surfactants at solid-liquid interfaces and, importantly, changes
              in them as a function of system parameters and to develop guidelines for
              optimum conditions and reagents for efficient interfacial processes.

The
              broader impact of this grant would be that an onsite ESR facility would aid in
              the endeavor of tailoring certain graduate courses to include practical
              training in spectroscopic methods.  Also, it would produce professional
              scientists and engineers in the area of interfacial science.
