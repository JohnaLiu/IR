Abstract    :
              This grant is investigating alternatives for a new framework for flexible power
              system analysis and design. The framework will be based on the need for power
              engineers that must be concerned with complex decision-making involving
              economic and environmental trade-offs in addition to added complications
              introduced by incorporation of new energy sources and increased reliability
              demands. This framework will be built from formal methods for flexible power
              systems. Power electronics provide the versatility necessary to physically
              implement flexible systems. This research will address use of localized power
              electronics control techniques for generation and load, resulting in a large,
              complicated switching network. Such networks have not been adequately studied.
              Therefore, analytical tools, including reduced-order and parallel methods, for
              large-scale switched systems will be developed. An economic analysis will be
              given in context of flexible power systems. These studies will help system
              planners make informed decisions about the trade-offs between electrical,
              environmental, and economic issues. However, making such difficult decisions is
              often done only qualitatively. This project will result in more scientific
              decision-making techniques for these complicated issues. Students will be
              better educated as a result of this project by new coursework in large system
              analysis and team energy projects.
