Abstract    :
              This proposal is for support of a symposium "Physiological Ecology of Migration:
              How to Fly, Fast, and Feed En Route " at the Third North American
              Ornithological Congress (NAOC) on 24-31 September 2002 in New Orleans, LA. The
              objectives for this symposium are twofold: (a) to bring together outstanding
              researchers who are actively studying migratory birds at different levels of
              biological organization (molecular, cellular, organismal, populations) and (b)
              to include researchers who can address the physiology of a taxonomically
              diverse set of migratory birds within a broad ecological context.  Such a focus
              is timely in that significant recent work has addressed the metabolic
              physiology of flying birds and the importance of phenotypic flexibility in
              organ systems for migrating birds.  However, this work has not been adequately
              integrated especially across various levels of biological organization, nor has
              this work been disseminated to a broader audience of ornithologists interested
              in the ecology of birds during migration. The contributors at the symposium
              will provide a diverse set of perspectives and approaches for studying the
              physiological ecology of migration in part because they include scientists at
              different stages of their careers, and from various countries represented by
              both men and women.
