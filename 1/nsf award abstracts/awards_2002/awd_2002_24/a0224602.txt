This workshop award supports fifteen American researchers in
              technical innovation to meet with leading Chinese researchers in technical
              innovation on the occasion of the Third International Symposium on Management
              of Technology, Hangzhou, China, October 2002.  The U.S. and Chinese researchers
              will exchange information and explore opportunities for collaborative research
              in an area of research, namely technical innovation, that has been identified
              by NSF and the National Natural Science Foundation of China together as a key
              area of policy discussion and joint research during the first decade of the
              21st century.  Members of the U.S. and Chinese teams have participated in two
              NSF-NSFC sponsored policy dialogues.  This bilateral workshop extends to
              discussions toward greater research collaboration.
