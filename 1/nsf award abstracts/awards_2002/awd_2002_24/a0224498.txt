              ABSTRACT

OCE-0224498


Although dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is the
              largest reservoir of fixed nitrogen in the surface ocean, little is know about
              its relationship to nitrogen fixation and the nitrogen nutrient requirements of
              the oceanic phytoplankton. In this Small Grant for Exploratory Research,
              investigators at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will take advantage
              of a cruise to the centtral gyre of the North Pacific Ocean to study the
              relationship between climate variation, water column physics, the biological
              community dynamics of obligate diazotrophs, and the production of dissolved
              organic nitrogen.  The research team will conduct observational studies as well
              as shipboard incubation experiments to determine how the fixed nitrogen
              generated by the activities of Trichodesmium and other diazotrophs are cycled
              in the surface ocean and how it relates to the pool of DON.
