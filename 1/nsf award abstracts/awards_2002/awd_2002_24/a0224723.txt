Abstract    :
              
This proposal focuses on the development of a conference on Cognitive
              Neuroscience Across the Lifespan.  The conference will be a satellite to the
              Cognitive Neuroscience Meeting in April 2002.  The primary objective is to push
              development in this emerging area with the ultimate goal of understanding how
              to maintain lifelong cognitive function, and how to maintain a healthy mind. 
              The conference will focus on understanding the link between overt cognitive
              behaviors and underlying neural functions across the lifespan.  The conference
              is designed to bring together for the first time, leading researchers in the
              cognitive neuroscience of aging, to highlight emerging issues, methodological
              challenges, and the small body of existing research in this domain, and to
              foster the exchange of ideas.
