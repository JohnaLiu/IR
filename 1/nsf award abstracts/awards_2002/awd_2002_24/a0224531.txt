Abstract    :
              Spanish Translation of Windows to the Universe Website

This project supports
              translation of the successful Windows to the Universe website
              (http://www.windows.ucar.edu) into Spanish. The Windows to the Universe (W2U)
              project was initiated in 1995, to develop a user-friendly learning system for
              students and the general public for the Earth and space sciences, linking to
              interdisciplinary humanities connections. All content on the W2U site is now
              available only in English. The site serves over 4 million users per year, ~65%
              of whom are K-12 students who visit the site frequently for classroom research
              and free-time browsing. The site is composed of thousands of multi-level hybrid
              cgi-html pages that are dynamically interpreted to serve content back to the
              user at the upper elementary, middle, or high school level. Each page also
              includes multiple images, and the main image on each page typically is linked
              to a larger version of the same image on a separate html page. All pages on the
              site include image credits, captions, and labeled and unlabeled buttons and
              navigation tools. Translation of the site into Spanish therefore requires a
              combination of text translation as well as graphics revision to develop a full
              second version of the site to serve the Spanish- speaking community. The
              project team will translate the web site with a multi-step process over a
              two-year interval, ensuring accuracy of the translation through
the use of a
              full-time professional Spanish translator and Spanish-speaking geoscientists.
              They will also develop a page translation management interface that will
              facilitate the interaction of the translators and W2U project staff.  Project
              staff will attend two Hispanic science education meetings in the second year to
              disseminate information about the availability of the new Spanish-language
              version of the W2U site.
