Title:  CISE RR: Processing and Display of Volume Images and
              High Resolution Image Sequence 


This proposal, acquiring resources for
              real-time processing and display of large volume imagery and high resolution
              image sequences, aims at supporting collaborative research projects in
              compressing and analyzing extremely large-scale images and high-bandwidth
              video. The infrastructure supports the collection and display of
              high-resolution imagery as well as the image processing computations. Moreover,
              it enables improved data transmission over gigabit network. Medicine, terahertz
              radiation sensing, and hyperspectral imagery, and digital cinema constitute the
              sources of the research. The equipment, to be placed in the Center for Image
              Processing Research (CIPR), supports the following collaborative research
              projects.
Volume and Hyperspectral Image Compression,
Terahertz Image
              Processing,
Multispectral Imaging in Electron Microscopy,
Transparent
              Migration of Complex Scientific Computing Software to Real-Time
              Execution,
Digital Cinema Compression,
Remote Collaboration Environment, and
              
Human Fatigue Monitoring and Machine Parts Tolerancing.
