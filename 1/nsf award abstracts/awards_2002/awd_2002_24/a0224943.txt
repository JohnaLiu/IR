This award supports Michael Schulz, Don Madison and students
              from  the University of Missouri, Rolla in a collaboration with Joachim Ulrich
              in the Department of Quantum Dynamics at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear
              Physics in Heidelberg, Germany.  The collaboration will investigate single and
              double ionization of helium by ion impact.  The U.S. group recently obtained
              for the first time complete three-dimensional images of the electron emission
              pattern in single ionization with the kinematics of all collision products
              fixed.  It was found that even state-of-the-art theories, which have been
              successful in describing the ionization process under restricted geometries, do
              not reproduce the measured three-dimensional images very well.  The present
              collaboration will develop new theoretical approaches designed to identify the
              important physical effects.  The German group is world renowned in the
              experimental techniques necessary to this collaboration.  The combination of
              experimental and theoretical expertise will lead to new and fundamentally
              important insight into the collision dynamics under study.
