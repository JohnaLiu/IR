This grant provides support for a workshop on the subject of
              creating transgenic plants for use in phytoremediation.  While much progress
              has been made in recent years on genetic modifications of plants for
              remediation, the problems of heavy metal uptake and accumulation in levels
              useful for phytoremediaton remain.  For organic phytoremediaton to be useful, a
              wide variety of trees must be transformed and activities optimized.  This
              workshop will provide an opportunity for scientists working in this area to
              present their most recent findings and to discuss how this potentially powerful
              technology might best be advanced.  The workshop is planned for September 2002
              in Seattle, Washington.
