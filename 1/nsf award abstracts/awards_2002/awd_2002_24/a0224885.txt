Abstract    :
              The Workshop on Early Child and Brain Development will be held in Bucharest,
              Romania June
12-15, 2002. The primary objective of the workshop is to open a
              dialogue between Romanian
researchers, academics and practitioners and their
              American counterparts. The state of
knowledge in Romania on early child
              development and brain development has suffered as a
result of long communist
              rule, and has advanced slowly in the decade since the fall of
              Nicolae
Ceausescu. As such, the workshop will also provide an introduction to
              the Romanian participants
to state-of-the-art knowledge in early child
              development and early brain development. The
Romanians and Americans
              participating in the workshop will be able to work together to
determine the
              specific information and resource needs of the various fields represented
              by
Romanian workshop participants. Finally, the workshop will enable the
              American participants to
make connections with possible collaborators and/or
              likely recipients for future
academic/research support.
