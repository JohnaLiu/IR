Abstract    :
              Succinate has many industrial applications and it maybe used in the future as an
              intermediary commodity chemical feedstock for producing bulk chemicals. 
              Routinely produced from petrochemicals, succinate can also be produced by
              fermentation from glucose.  Developing a low-cost fermentation process with
              high succinate yields would create a new use for agricultural products.  The
              best succinate producer, Actinobacillus succinogenes, produces up to 100 g/l of
              succinate.  To engineer an A. succinogenes strain able to produce even more
              succinate at a higher chemical yield, the Principal Investigators (PIs) will
              determine which metabolic fluxes to target for genetic manipulation.  A system
              of linear stoichiometric equations (expressed as a matrix) will be built, based
              on A. succinogenes metabolic network.  Experimental data (i.e., fermentation
              balance, biomass production, and label distribution in succinate, formate, and
              acetate) collected from continuous cultures grown in the presence of 13
              C-NaHCO3 or 2- 13 C-glucose will be fed into this stoichiometric matrix to
              calculate the fluxes in the different pathways.  Control exerted on flux
              distribution by different metabolic branches will be evaluated by growing
              cultures in a variety of conditions.  Each growth condition will differ from
              the optimized, standard conditions by a single parameter.  Parameters will
              include enzyme-specific inhibitors, different carbon sources, new enzyme
              activities (by introduction of recombinant genes), and added reducing power (by
              the intermediary of an electrically-reduced artificial electron carrier).  The
              conclusions drawn from these metabolic flux analyses should give insights on
              how to engineer A. succinogenes to produce more succinate.
