Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding for research on methods for performance evaluation
              of large network models of complex systems that arise in manufacturing and
              communication systems.  The systems in mind are so complex that simulation is
              typically the only viable tool for benchmarking the system. Unfortunately,
              simulation is not a particularly scalable technology.  The research focuses on
              developing fast and efficient simulation methods for complex systems, by
              exploiting prior knowledge of the system's dynamics. Such prior knowledge may
              be obtained from examination of a "fluid model", for example, which is an
              idealized model of complex systems where all entities are modeled as fluids
              flowing through pipes.  A great deal is known about fluid models, and the hope
              is that this information can lead to very efficient simulation methods.

If
              successful, the results of this research will ensure that simulation becomes a
              more scalable tool than before for a large class of systems.  The central idea
              is that more accurate results may be obtained in (far) less time than would
              otherwise be the case.  One can then implement more efficient algorithms for
              searching over different operating policies to determine the best operating
              policy, or at the very least one that is better than the existing policy.
