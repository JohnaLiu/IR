Abstract    :
              0224561   Alvarez  Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous
              pollutants that can bioaccumulate and can be acutely toxic.  Some plants can
              enhance the degradation of PAHs by stimulating microbiological activity in the
              root zone (rhizosphere) of plants.
This phytoremediation is an attractive
              process where climatic conditions are favorable as in the tropics.  Root
              exudates from tropical plants will be screened for their ability to enhance PAH
              degradation and the mechanism of enhancement studied.  The humification and
              sequestration of PAHs into soil will be examined as an acceptable low-cost
              treatment.
