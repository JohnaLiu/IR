Abstract    :
              Disease interacts with the environment in a variety of ways.  This is
              particularly true for diseases with complex life cycles.  A basic understanding
              of the way that parasites with complex life cycles interact with man-made
              changes to the environment will help us anticipate future changes in such
              diseases. This project will use a variety of experimental, observational and
              theoretical approaches to develop a comprehensive and synthetic understanding
              of the interactions between man-made environmental change, parasite
              communities, and the extent to which these changes affect host
              communities.

Salt marshes are a useful model ecosystem to address the role
              of diseases since these wetlands are subject to a wide range of man-made
              impacts and support a diverse community of trematode worm parasites.  Examples
              of changes that can affect parasite communities include losses to biodiversity,
              pollution, introduced species and climate change.  The effects of these impacts
              are not likely to be the same for all diseases.  Because some parasitic
              diseases can alter the community of hosts that they infect (such as by altering
              the flow of energy through an ecosystem or by changing predator-prey
              relationships) there may be complex feedback between changes in the
              environment, diseases and ecosystems.
