Abstract    :
              Our study investigates landscape change and plague occurrence in the
              black-tailed prairie dog and associated species, to understand the human health
              and ecological risks of landscape alteration and disease introduction. 
              Black-tailed prairie dogs have been considered a 'keystone' species of
              short-grass prairie ecosystems in the western US.  The abundance and
              distribution of prairie dogs may influence the occurrence of many native plant
              and animal species.  Blood diseases like plague spread through contact between
              black-tailed prairie dogs and co-occurring alternate mammalian hosts. Through a
              combination of field data collection, laboratory studies, and computer
              simulation modeling, we will examine ecological relationships of hosts,
              vectors, and pathogens at the local, landscape, and regional scales.

Because
              our study system includes landscape change and recent disease introduction, it
              is representative of problems faced by many ecosystems as habitat fragmentation
              and disease transport increase worldwide.  By focusing on this
              host-vector-disease system we will isolate anthropogenic effects that influence
              disease emergence and resurgence.  By carefully examining the modes and scales
              of contact within this complex community, we hope to discover the potential for
              ecological and epidemiological keystone effects of prairie dogs. This discovery
              will elucidate whether anthropogenic effects on ecological systems can have
              predictable consequences for disease transmission and dynamics.
