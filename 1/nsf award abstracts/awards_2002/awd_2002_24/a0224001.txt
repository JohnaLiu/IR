Abstract    :
              0224001
Travel support is provided for US participants in a US-Brazil Workshop
              on Applied Mechanics, to be held in Brazil during Aug. 12-23, 2002.  The
              purpose of the workshop is to explore avenues for collaboration and joint
              research and to increase mutual awareness of research activities in the two
              countries.  The workshop will be held immediately following "The Second
              Symposium on Computational Modeling and Multi-Scale Phenomena".  The workshop
              will also include a number of site visits to universities and government
              laboratories.  Provisions have been made for the participation of students and
              new researchers.
