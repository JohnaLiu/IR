Title:CISE RR:
              Instrumentation Support for Very Large Data Stores 

This proposal, designing
              a system using Massive Arrays of Idle Disks (MAID) as a replacement for data
              centers that would normally use tape archives, will utilize infrastructure in
              the design and fabrication of an alternative design to conventional mass
              storage systems that attempt to address critical data center issues such as
              data density (i.e., reduced floor space), reliability, power efficiency, and
              manageability. Using a combination of commodity disk drives, power management,
              distributed control, and caching hierarchy, the researcher claims that the MAID
              storage organization provides storage densities matching or exceeding those of
              tape libraries with performances similar to disk arrays. Studies have shown
              that through a combination of effective power management of individual drives
              and caching, this performance can be achieved using a very small power
              envelope. The large backing store will be composed of inexpensive IDE disks
              that, rather than spinning, are allowed to go idle when not in use. The main
              goal consists of replacing conventional tape archival storage with an
              alternative technology at significantly reduced power cost. The experimental
              testbed consists of 120 IDE drives, each of which holds 160GB of data for a
              total of 19.2TB of online storage, of which approximately 160TB would be
              available once redundancy is addressed. The infrastructure also includes 120
              drive enclosures that connect commodity IDE drives to 1394 (firewire) I/O
              networks.
