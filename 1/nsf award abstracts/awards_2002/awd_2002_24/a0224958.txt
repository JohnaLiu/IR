Abstract    :
              Schistosomiasis is a debilitating parasitic disease caused by trematodes of the
              genus Schistosoma, which alternates between human and snail hosts  The disease
              now occurs in 74 countries and is ranked second to malaria as a cause of human
              morbidity by a parasitic agent.  The proposed research program has been
              designed to determine if fish that feed on snails can be an effective
              biological control agent for schistosomiasis in Lake Malawi.  Specifically, the
              researchers propose to (1) conduct seasonal surveys of the snail-feeding fishes
              and their snail prey on a lake-wide level; (2) identify and describe the
              shallow water snail-eating fishes in Lake Malawi; (3) determine habitat
              preferences of host snails; (4) determine seasonal snail infection status; and
              (5) determine infection and re-infection rates in human populations.  These
              data will be used to develop models that predict the relationship of fish/snail
              populations to infection rates in the human population.  By comparing these
              data to a historical database (i.e., pre-1988), researchers will be able to
              test the hypothesis that the reduction of snail-eating fishes, due to
              overfishing, led to the increase of schistosome infection in human populations
              inhabiting the lake shore of Lake Malawi.  

If low population numbers of
              snail-eating fish can be linked to an increase in schistosomiasis, then
              researchers will be able to convince government officials to effectively manage
              these fish populations.  The successful management of indigenous snail-eating
              fish would have a major impact on the quality of life of the human population
              in the region.  In addition, these studies will provide supplemental
              information needed to design a comprehensive biological control program for
              human schistosomiasis in other parts of the world.
