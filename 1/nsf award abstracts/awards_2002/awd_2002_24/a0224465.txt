Title: 
              CISE RR: QPQ: An Open Source Deductive Software Repository 

This project,
              establishing a deductive software repository, aims at making software more
              available, reliable, durable, higher quality, uniform. Deductive software
              consists of symbolic routines for logical manipulations including decision
              procedures, solvers, rewriters, model checkers, and theorem provers. It serves
              as the semantic foundation for many scientific and engineering applications in
              areas such as hardware and software verification, program synthesis and
              analysis, data- and knowledge-based systems, artificial intelligence,
              linguistics, and e-commerce. This work outlines an initiative for deductive
              software components called QPQ ("quid pro quo") as a marketplace for
              publishing, exchanging, and refining deductive software components. The
              refereed publication and distribution of such scientific software components in
              open source often yields higher quality, greater visibility, and accelerated
              productivity. Efficient implementation of deductive algorithms, an extremely
              complex and delicate task, requires serious investment in basic infrastructure
              such as concrete and abstract syntax, syntactic tools (parsers, typecheckers,
              pretty-printer), primitive operations (substitution, matching, unification,
              normalization), and advanced operations (constraint satisfaction, forward and
              backward chaining, rewriting, simplification, decision procedures, induction
              methods). Potential impacts include availability, reliability, quality,
              durability, productivity, visibility, uniformity, synergy, serendipity, and
              history. The following principles will be employed in running the repository:
              authenticity, uniqueness, access, relevance, format, quality and version
              control, and academic credit. QPQ is already recognized as a valuable resource
              for research and education in deductive software. With its role in facilitating
              the semantic web and through other applications of logico-symbolic computing,
              the QPQ repository might become crucial to society.
