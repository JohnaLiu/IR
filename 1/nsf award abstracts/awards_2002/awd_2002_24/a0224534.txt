Abstract    :
              Education Using Audioguides on Research in the Sciences

The University
              Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) will pilot the development of an
              audioguide that will help to improve knowledge about and accessibility to
              science learning for visitors currently underserved by programs at the National
              Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Mesa Laboratory. This creative endeavor,
              entitled Education Using Audioguides on Research in the Sciences (EARS), will
              be informed by experts on the hearing and vision- impaired and low-income,
              native Spanish speakers. The goals of EARS are to engage and inform thousands
              of visitors who cannot or choose not to take a staff-guided tour at the Mesa
              Lab; improve accessibility to exhibits for visitors who have low vision,
              blindness, or hearing loss; extend this educational experience to the region's
              low-income immigrant population through the audioguide's translation into
              Spanish; and enhance family learning about hands-on exhibits and the science
              inquiry process.  EARS will be developed under the experienced leadership of
              staff in UCAR's Office of Education and Outreach, in consultation with NCAR
              scientists and representatives of the Colorado Center for the Blind, Self Help
              for the Hard of Hearing, and the Family Learning Center. A well-recognized
              provider of audioguide technology and production has been selected to create
              the new EARS communications resource.
