Abstract    :
              This proposal is a request for funding to establish and operate an IGERT
              National Recruitment Program (INRP) that will serve all of the Integrative
              Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) sites in the United States
              (soon to be 100 sites).  The goal will be to identify potential IGERT students
              and to facilitate their recruitment by the IGERT sites.  A high priority will
              be to increase the participation of under-represented groups including women
              and minorities.  The national recruitment program will identify these students
              and educate them and their mentors regarding IGERT programs and future career
              opportunities. The INRP will assess student backgrounds and creer interests and
              will facilitate contact between prospective students and the directors and
              faculty of the appropriate IGERT program(s).  This represents a partnership
              between the INRP and the IGERT directors and faculty to recruit students into
              appropriate IGERT sites and related opportunities.  Recruitment will occur at
              colleges and universities throughout the United States and at national and
              regional minority student science conferences.
