Abstract    :
              SeaMaven, a Prototype Virtual Learning Environment

The Georgia Tech Research
              Institute (GTRI) is collaborating with the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography
              (SkIO) in a two-year pilot project to develop SeaMaven, a prototype Virtual
              Learning Environment for studying the marine ecosystem.  SeaMaven enables
              middle school age science students to actively engage in collaborative learning
              in the environmental sciences through the innovative use of telecommunications
              technologies. Students access an interactive Web site and take atmospheric and
              hydrology measurements of the ecosystem off the Georgia/South Carolina coast in
              near real-time. The project provides a virtual tour of a 5700 square kilometer
              area of the continental shelf with access to a number of platform-based sensor
              stations for monitoring environmental parameters. The interactive online sensor
              displays give students the opportunity to record measurements, compare data,
              and generate hypotheses based on their observations. Working alone or in
              groups, students create their own science projects to monitor ocean-atmosphere
              interactions over a period of weeks, months, or years. The Web site also
              enables electronic discussion forums on the materials and ideas generated by
              the experience, and interaction with the scientists for answering questions,
              hypothesis posing and testing, and determining how the project is proceeding.
