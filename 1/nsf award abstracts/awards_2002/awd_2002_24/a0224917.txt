Abstract    :
              Inputs to the global nitrogen cycle have increased significantly due to human
              activities and there are many uncertainties in our knowledge of how this
              nitrogen enrichment will impact terrestrial biotic communities and ecosystem
              function.  Among these is the impact that nitrogen enrichment is having on
              decomposer organisms and the litter decomposition process.  The overall
              objective of this research is to examine how plant litter chemistry (lignin and
              nitrogen content) and external nitrogen availability interact to impact the
              composition and/or activity of the litter microbial community.  Because
              nutrient cycles are being significantly altered by human activities, basic
              ecological research is needed to determine whether anthropogenic disturbance is
              impairing the ability of ecosystems to function sustainably.  This research
              will contribute to our understanding of how decomposer microorganisms respond
              to nitrogen additions and to enhance our ability to predict how nitrogen
              enrichment impacts the litter decomposition process.
