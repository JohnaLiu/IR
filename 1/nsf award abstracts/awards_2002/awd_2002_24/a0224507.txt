Abstract    :
              The Interactive Ground-Water Tutorial Prototype Web Site

This project
              constructs a prototype web-based ground-water tutorial, a  "hands-on" tool for
              teaching secondary Earth and Space Science and Environmental Science students
              concepts related to ground-water flow and to the human impacts on surface- and
              ground-water systems. Most of the work performed in this two-year,
              proof-of-principle project focuses on developing the interface that will enable
              the student to interact with the modules on the prototype web site. The project
              encourages inquiry instruction by incorporating role-play exercises and
              mathematical simulations of ground-water flow and contaminant transport in a
              stream-aquifer system to solve environmental problems. Role-play exercises
              could potentially include using simulation results to help prevent: (1) a
              contaminant plume from reaching the stream and (2) contamination of an aquifer
              by a spill that has been dumped into a nearby stream where the aquifer is used
              for public water supply.  A guidance module will provide: (1) a framework to
              help guide role-play actions and (2) an orientation for the student and (3) a
              means to update the student about the simulated situation during the role-play.
              The project is a collaboration between the Kansas Geological Survey, the
              University of Kansas Upward Bound Math Science Center, Pathfinder Science, and
              Kansas StreamLink. Kansas City Kansas Community College, the Lawrence, Kansas
              USD #497 will participate in field-testin
