              ABSTRACT

Unifying Chronostratigraphic Databases Workshop

The American Geological Institute proposes
              to convene a workshop to bring together a number of the groups working on
              chronostratigraphic databases.  The primary goal of the workshop is to
              establish the framework for a consortium of scientific entities that will
              undertake a sustained effort to continually recalibrate the time scale, while
              simultaneously reassessing its relationship to a wide variety of geologic data
              and temp[oral patterns through a coordinated data system of geologic time. 
              Through the workshop, participants will identify the nature, similarities, and
              issues facing each chronostratigraphic effort currently underway.  

A well
              calibrated, properly applied geologic time scale is essential to our
              understanding the evolution of the Earth, including the ages of rocks and
              fossils, timing of major events in earth history, and rates of natural
              processes.  The workshop will examine the needs of a range of end-users of a
              coordinated data system dealing with geologic time.  By establishing a list of
              primary end-user needs as well as issues facing each organization, an effective
              plan for building a coordinated data system of geologic time can be effectively
              constructed.
