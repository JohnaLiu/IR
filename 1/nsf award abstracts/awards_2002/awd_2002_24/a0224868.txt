              ABSTRACT

SGER Sequence stratigraphy and paleocommunity analysis of an
              Oligocene reef tract, Lares Limestone, Puerto Rico (EAR-0224868)

The Lares Limestone in Puerto Rico provides a
              unique opportunity to study a 30 million year old Oligocene reef from its
              initiation surface through its drowning, and from its seaword to landward
              expression.  The opportunity is short lived, for heavy tropical rainfall has
              compromised the quality of this roadcut exposure.  There is an urgency to
              document and analyze this tropical carbonate platform and to address hypotheses
              in the fields of paleobiology, sequence stratigraphy and paleoclimatology. 
              Research results will provide valuable information on evolution in a tropical
              environment.
