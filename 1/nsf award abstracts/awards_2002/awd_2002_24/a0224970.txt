Abstract    :
              The workshop titled ``Radical Innovations of software and systems
engineering
              of the future'' to be held October 7-11, 2002 at
Universita' Ca'Foscari di
              Venezia in Venice, Italy, will bring
together leading researchers in all
              aspects of Software and System
Engineering with a view towards discussing
              potential research topics of
tomorrow.  To accomplish this goal, the workshop
              will have several
talks and several open discussions, with the hope that the
              latter
would lead to cross-fertilization of ideas from several
              disparate
sub-areas of Software and Systems Engineering.
