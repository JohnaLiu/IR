Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to metabolically engineer bacteria to produce
              high levels of folic acid directly from glucose as opposed to transforming a
              more expensive raw material such as para amino benzoic acid (PABA). 
              Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P), glutamate, and GTP are
              the glucose-derived precursors of folic acid.  Thus, from the concentration and
              formation flux standpoints, these four precursors need to be engineered to be
              amply available.  The metabolic engineering approach will initially focus on
              increasing further the formation of chorismate, a PEP and E4P-derived
              intermediate in folic acid biosynthesis.  The proposed tasks are: (1) alter
              regulation to increase the flux to chorismate while limiting the side reactions
              from chorismate to amino acids, (2) model and map the fluxes in the folic
              acid-producing candidate strain of B. subtilis using the investigators software
              and NMR analyses, (3) test the strains in batch and continuous cultivation, and
              (4) based on the results of steps 1-3, further fine tune the pathways.  After
              achieving success on the chorismate-side of the folic acid biosynthetic
              pathway, subsequent work can explore whether other precursors (e.g. GTP) have
              become limiting.
