Abstract    :
              A new type of integration, called motivic integration, has been proposed
by M.
              Konsevitch and developed by Denef and Loeser.  They show that many
of the
              classical properties of p-adic integration can be extended to to
the motivic
              context.  The research of this proposal will adapt motivic
integration to the
              representation theory and the harmonic analysis of
reductive groups over
              fields of formal Laurent series in characteristic
zero.  This new theory will
              be developed from first principles, starting
with the existence of motivic
              Haar measures. 

The starting point of much of modern mathematics is the
              theory of
integration, as developed by Isaac Newton, and generations
              of
mathematicians that have followed him.  An unexpected development came
              in
1995, when the mathematician M. Kontsevich developed an entirely new
              way
to integrate.  This new tool will allow mathematicians to
              significantly
enlarge the scope of mathematics.  The research of this grant
              will
accomplish part of this project, by using this new tool to enlarge
              the
scope of representation theory, a branch of modern algebra.
