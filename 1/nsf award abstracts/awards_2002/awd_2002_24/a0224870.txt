Abstract    :
              The project will investigate the dynamical processes that generate intraseasonal
              variability in the equatorial components of the atmospheric angular momentum.
              These components of the 3D angular momentum vector are orthogonal to its axial
              component, which has been intensely studied in the past because of its
              association with variations in the zonal-mean zonal wind. The equatorial
              components, on the other hand, are related to planetary-scale atmospheric wave
              variability (including, potentially, the Madden-Julian oscillation), and are
              consequential for polar motion. Dr. Feldstein will conduct a dynamically
              oriented diagnosis of the mechanisms generating intraseasonal variability in
              equatorial angular momentum. He will analyze long-term integrations of
              atmospheric general circulation model (albeit with an idealized lower boundary
              condition) and a record of reanalyzed atmospheric observations (produced by the
              National Centers for Environmental Prediction) to shed light on the evolution
              of this variability. The project will advance the understanding of atmospheric
              angular momentum variability, and contribute to improvements in prediction
              skill of the medium and longer-range weather forecasts.
