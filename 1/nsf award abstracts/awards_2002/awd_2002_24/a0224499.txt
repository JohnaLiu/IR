Abstract    :
              In June of 2002, a workshop will be held on Fundamentals of
              Distributed
Computing at Bertinoro, Italy.  From a set of 43
              outstanding
submissions, a total of 30 white papers were selected for
              publication,
and 46 researchers (including a number of students) invited to
              attend
the workshop.  NSF provides travel funding to support attendance
by
              these students, many of whom are on very tight budgets.  The workshop
will
              help set the agenda for a new generation of research in distributed
computing
              while also knitting together the European and American
research communities in
              the area.  

Quality of the white papers was very high, and we have
              approached
Springer-Verlag about the possibility of revising and extending
              them
into a book-length treatment.   Our hope is that we might use
              the
workshop to develop a unified vision and to elucidate the research
agenda
              in various areas of the discipline, then use this as a structure
for the white
              papers.  The resulting book will be both a snapshot of the
state of the art
              and also a coherent articulation of research
opportunities in the coming
              decade.
