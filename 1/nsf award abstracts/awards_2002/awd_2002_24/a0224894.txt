Abstract    :
              Conferences on frontier topics have played a central role in the development of
              Physics for decades. The possible detection of Gravitational Wave Radiation is
              one of these topics. A series of six Aspen Winter Physics conferences on
              Gravitational Waves and Their Detection has been very successful in exploring
              this subject and in galvanizing the community. The Aspen Winter Conference on
              Gravitational Waves, called the Gravitational Wave Advanced Detector Workshop
              (GWADW), usually held in January or February, will not take place in Aspen in
              2002, but is to be replaced by an analogous conference to be held in Isola
              d'Elba, Italy, May 19-26, 2002. The conference will return to Aspen in January
              or February, 2003.

The subtitle of the Elba workshop is, "Toward a Global
              Detection Network". The goal is to discuss the physics coverage that can be
              achieved considering that, in the near future, there will be interferometers in
              the US, Europe (in Pisa and Hannover), and in Japan and these can be operated
              as a combined global array. There is, as well, an array of resonant detectors
              that can be included. Finally, space based detectors may be included someday.
              Sensitivity is going to improve thanks to the many ongoing Research and
              Development programs. This proposal requests travel support for participants in
              the Elba workshop.
