Abstract    :
              The Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) is an interagency center
              devoted to space weather modeling and prediction.  One of the goals of the CCMC
              is to determine which space weather models are appropriate for use in
              operational space weather forecasting.  This project will examine the various
              metrics and scientific validation methods that should be applied to space
              weather models.  The CCMC staff will perform direct data-model comparisons for
              space weather events.  It will also provide an independent, unbiased forum for
              calculating the prediction or nowcasting metrics for different space weather
              models.  In addition to the calculation of metrics and general scientific
              validation of models, the CCMC will explore the models performances under
              different space weather conditions to determine the limits under which the
              models can be used.
