Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to improve the productivity of indole alkaloids
              in a well-characterized model plant tissue culture system, C. roseus.  The
              overall goals are to determine the metabolic effects of genetic manipulations
              of some key enzymes in the indole and non-mevalonate terpenoid pathways on flux
              through the indole alkaloid synthesis pathways, with special emphasis on the
              interplay between primary and secondary metabolism on the final alkaloid
              productivity.  The specific objectives are to: 1) construct and characterize
              transgenic hairy root lines overexpressing key enzymes, such as ORCA3, G10H,
              DXS, DXR and AS-beta under the control of a recently characterized inducible
              promoter system; 2) develop methods for NMR- based metabolic flux maps; 3)
              perform metabolic characterization of these first generation
transgenic lines;
              4) develop techniques for co-transformation that allow the introduction
              of
multiple genes; 5) construct and characterize a second generation of
              transgenic lines expressing strategic combinations of genes as determined from
              the results of the first generation transgenic lines above.
