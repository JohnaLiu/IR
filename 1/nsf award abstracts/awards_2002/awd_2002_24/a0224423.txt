Title:  CISE RR: Acquisition of a
              Haptic Device 


This proposal, acquiring a PHANTOM haptic device that can
              display full force and torque feedback to the user, aims at supporting two
              haptic research projects inspired by applications such as virtual assembly,
              virtual prototyping, remote collaboration, and teleoperation. The following
              projects will benefit from the instrumentation:

Haptic Rendering of Complex
              Contact States and Compliant Motion and 
Cooperative Virtual Object
              Manipulation. 

The former is concerned with how to simulate and render, with
              high fidelity and in real time, the effect felt by a human operator due to the
              contacts involving the part he/she holds and other parts during manual assembly
              in a virtual environment. The device will enable a human operator to feel the
              resulted collision and reaction forces and torques to test the quality and
              fidelity of simulation. The latter project is concerned with how to simulate,
              again with high fidelity and real time, the cooperative manipulation process of
              physical objects in a virtual world via haptic devices. With full force and
              torque display from the device, the collaborative parties can obtain the
              necessary cues for effective coordination. This project provides the
              opportunity for cross-discipline collaboration between the PIs.
