This is a U.S.-Hong Kong joint workshop proposal on Recent
              Developments in Complex Variables, Cauchy Riemann Geometry and Complex
              Algebraic Geometry submitted by Dr. Stephen Yau, University of Illinois and Dr.
              Ngaiming Mok, Hong Kong University. The meeting will be held at Hong Kong
              University, May 12-16, 2003.  The conference covers an important topic in
              mathematics, with the attendance of top level of researchers from the U.S.,
              Hong Kong and China.  With the inclusion of junior scientists from the U.S.,
              this conference could provide an important venue for these U.S. scientists to
              meet with their colleagues from East Asia.
