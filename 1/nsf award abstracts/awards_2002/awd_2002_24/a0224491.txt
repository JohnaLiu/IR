.Funds are requested ($22,721) to allow three U.S.
              scientists to participate
in the 12th Conference of the International Soil
              Conservation Organization
in Beijing, to help launch research under the
              Sino-U.S. Centers for Soil and
Water Conservation and Environmental
              Protection, and to participate in, and
report on, the opening ceremonies of
              the joint Centers in Yangling, China.
The principal investigator, the director
              of the U.S. arm of the joint
Centers, will also coordinate Centers' research
              plans with personnel in
other Chinese ministries and the U.S. Embassy, all of
              whom potentially play
important roles in determining the success of the
              Centers. The facilitator
for the Centers' Joint Organizing Committee and a
              remote sensing specialist
complete the trio. These funds will ensure
              participation of non-federal
representatives among a larger delegation of
              Federal agency staff
representing the Centers.
