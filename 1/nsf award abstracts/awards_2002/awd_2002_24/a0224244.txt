TITLE: Imperative Programming with Dependent
              Types

Programming is notoriously error-prone. As a consequence, a
              great
number of approaches have been developed to facilitate program
              error
detection.  The proposed research intends to enrich practical
              imperative
programming with a type discipline that allows for specification
              and
inference of significantly more precise information on programs
              than
those enforced in languages such as Java and Standard ML.  The
              primary
motivation for developing such a type discipline is to enable
              the
programmer to capture with types more program properties such as
memory
              safety and then enforce these captured properties through
type-checking.  This
              practice allows for detecting more program errors
in less time. Another
              motivation is to use the type discipline to
generate memory safety proofs for
              low-level code and thus effectively
produce proof-carrying code that asserts
              its own memory safety.  In
short, the research studies a type discipline for
              practical imperative
programming at both high and low levels, aiming for
              producing software
that is not only more robust to run but also less costly to
              maintain.
