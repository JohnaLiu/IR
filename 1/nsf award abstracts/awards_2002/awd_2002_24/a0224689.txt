              ABSTRACT


This proposal requests funding to support the participation of
              student attendees at the
International Limnogeology Congress, to be held in
              Tucson, Arizona, Mar 29-Apr. 2, 2003. The congress is intended to promote
              interaction between specialists in all aspects of the study of the geology of
              lake deposits. Specialists in geochronology, sedimentology,
paleoecology,
              paleoclimatology and sedimentary geochemistry will all be in attendance at the
              meeting, which is expected to draw approximately 200 participants.
              Cross-fertilization of ideas at conferences such as this are critical for
              graduate students at an early stage of career, both in establishing a wide
              network of contacts (both in the US and internationally) and in efficiently
              showcasing their work to a key element of the scientific community. We request
              sufficient funds to defer registration costs and provide partial travel support
              for approximately 10 students. Selection criteria for student support grants
              will be based on both relevance of the student's research work to the general
              conference goals, and on evidence from the student (advisor's letter of support
              and personal statement) indicating the quality and significance of the work to
              be presented.
