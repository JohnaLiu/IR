Abstract    :
              0224006  Anex  This MUSES project is aimed at developing the people, skills and
              tools needed for understanding the system-wide sustainability of biobased
              products.  The transition to a sustainable raw material base will be one of the
              most important challenges facing society in the 21st Century.  As part of this
              endeavor, substantial increases in the use of biomass-derived feedstock in the
              chemical industry are expected over the next 50 years.
A key task of the
              project is organizing and hosting a two-day international workshop on assessing
              the sustainability of biobased products.  The team will develop background
              materials for workshop participants that will include a survey of the
              technologies that underlie biobased material production and a survey of the
              literature on biobased material assessment techniques and sustainability
              indicators.  Drawing on the expertise of the interdisciplinary research team,
              the literature, and the output of the consensus workshop, the team will develop
              a framework for evaluating the complex environmental-social-industrial system
              comprising biobased material production, use, and end-of-life disposition.
The
              team will be working throughout the project with the Authentic Teaching
              Alliance (ATA) to prepare a teaching module appropriate for secondary math and
              science classes.  A team of two ATA Fellows and one secondary math or science
              teacher will partner with our team to develop and evaluate a learning module. 
              This module will serve as a template for planned future module development.  A
              case study applying sustainability indicators to a biobased material life cycle
              will also be developed and distributed as an education resource.
