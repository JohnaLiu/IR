Abstract    :
              Reactions of metal monohalides and monoxides of environmental concern are
              studied over wide temperature and pressure ranges.  Similar measurements are
              
made on combustion reactions of metal cations.  Individual reactions will
              be
studied in isolation using the Rensselaer HTFFR (high-temperature fast-flow
              reactor) and HTP (high-temperature photochemistry) reactors, suitable for the
              300 to 1800 K temperature domain.  Together these can be used to cover pressure
              from 10 to 1000 mbar.  The measurements with these facilities are free from
              interference by other reactions;  temperature, pressure, and concentrations can
              be varied independently.

Very little is known of the temperature dependence
              of the kinetics of ion-molecule reactions.  Such reactions are usually observed
              below combustion temperatures, frequently in non-thermalized environments.  The
              use of the HTP reactors allows study of bulk, temperature-equilibrated
              reactions by laser-induced fluorescence, LIF.  The use of LIF provides a novel
              method for the study of ion-molecule reactions, which are commonly studied by
              mass spectrometry.  Exothermic and endothermic as well as addition reactions of
              alkaline-earth cations of combustion interest are addressed.  The results of
              this work are needed by combustion engineers, particularly modelers concerned
              with pollution abatement, and are  also useful for workers in high-temperature
              materials, propulsion, chemical vapor deposition, and atmospheric chemistry.
