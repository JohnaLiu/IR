Abstract    :
              This award supports an international workshop to bring awardees of the
              Arabidopsis Functional Genomics Networks program funded by the German Deutsche
              Forschungsgemeinschaft and of the Arabidopsis 2010 Project funded by the
              National Science Foundation. The workshop is to take place on June 29-30, 2002,
              in Seville Spain, during the XIIIth International Arabidopsis Research
              Conference.  The goal of the workshop is to provide a forum for the two groups
              of scientists to meet face to face and maximize the opportunity to coordinate
              their research and to develop research collaboration where appropriate. The two
              programs share the same goal of identifying the function of all Arabidopsis
              genes by the year 2010.  Representatives from the 2010-like programs in other
              countries will be invited as observers so that international collaborations
              could be expanded beyond Germany and the US.  One of the expected outcomes
              would be an increased exchange of students and young scientists between
              participating laboratories.
