Abstract    :
              A $50,000 Planning Grant will be awarded to the American Association for the
              Advancement of Science (AAAS) to develop an environmental science education
              program that targets adult learners in literacy programs.  The planning grant
              will support a survey of literacy agencies, a pilot program and a focus group
              evaluation.   AAAS will first survey literacy programs across the U.S. to
              assess the need for science related programming.  Using the results, they will
              then modify and pilot previously developed environmental science activities at
              the Learning Bank in Baltimore, a community literacy center.  Participants will
              then take part in focus groups to determine the effectiveness of the materials
              used.  The overall goal is to develop a program model that can be disseminated
              at literacy centers throughout the country.
