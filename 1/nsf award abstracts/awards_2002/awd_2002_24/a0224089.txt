This award supports the participation of American scientists
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on MLabNet 2000-advanced multimedia systems and
              applications, to be held in Karuizawa, Japan from October 10-12, 2001.  The
              co-organizers are professors William Grosky of Wayne State University and
              Professor Frederic Andres of the National Institute of Informatics (NII) in
              Tokyo, Japan.  MlabNet is a virtual multimedia research framework between
              various institutions in the United States, Japan, France, Italy and Thailand
              and has existed since April 1999.  Two important projects being investigated
              under this framework are the Very Large-Scale Hypermedia Delivery System
              (VLSHDS) and MediaSys, which provides an extensible interface for multimedia
              management.

The proposed seminar will include research presentations,
              posters, and demonstrations.  It will assess the research cooperation inside
              MLabNet in the context of these projects, as well as address issues in
              information access and sharing multimedia content between the involved
              countries.  They will also address issues in cultural heritage, in the context
              of future research issues related to the National Science Foundation framework,
              the Japanese Ministry of Education framework, and the Fifth Framework set by
              the European Union.  Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve
              younger researchers, postdocs and graduate students as both participants and
              observers.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field
              will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage
              for future collaborative projects.  Dissemination of information on the seminar
              will be available on the World Wide Web.
