Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for construction of new visitor housing at
              the University of Washington's Friday Harbor Laboratory (FHL).  The housing
              will be used in support of an innovative scientific research apprenticeship
              training program that brings together teams composed of faculty mentors,
              graduate students and undergraduate apprentices who work in residence at the
              Laboratory for 10 weeks during the academic year.  Teams are selected from a
              national pool of applicants by an external review committee on the basis of
              written applications.  The success and growth of this program has created a
              need for additional, modern housing at the FHL, most of whose existing housing
              units were built to serve as summertime housing. The program has a major impact
              on the numbers and quality of  undergraduate and graduate students who opt for
              professional  contributions to very high quality research programs nationally
              and  internationally.  Through direct involvement with world-class mentors,
              students learn how leading edge research is done, what some of the key
              questions in marine science fields are, and what career opportunities
              exist.
