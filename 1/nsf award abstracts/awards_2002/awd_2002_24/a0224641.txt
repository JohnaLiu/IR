Abstract    :
              

US Fish and Wildlife have provided support to the Office of Polar Programs
              by allowing the project of Dr. James Estes, University of California, Santa
              Cruz, to use the MV Tiglax.  The project (OPP 99-85814) titled "Introduced
              Foxes And Seabirds: The Role Of Top-Down Processes In Controlling Marine
              Subsidies To Terrestrial Ecosystems" worked in the Aleutian Islands, for 15
              days, beginning 7th August ending 22 August, 2001.   The vessel was well
              matched for the type of work, and OPP intends to develop an interagency
              agreement with US Fish and Wildlife for future support using MV Tiglax.
