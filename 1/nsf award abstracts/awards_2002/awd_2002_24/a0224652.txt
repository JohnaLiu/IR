Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99)
This project is supporting a two-day national conference
              on "Undergraduate Research and Scholarship
 and the Mission of the Research
              University" at the Reinvention Center at SUNY Stony Brook. 
The conference,
              which will take place on November 14-15, 2002, will bring together
university
              faculty, administrators, and students, as well as representatives of
              disciplinary
associations, government agencies, and private foundations, to
              focus on fundamental, institutional,
cultural, and academic issues that are
              inherent to research universities. Such issues must be
addressed if research
              universities are going to maximize their potential and bring
              research,
scholarship, and creative activity to the forefront of the
              undergraduate education they offer, as
envisioned in the Boyer Commission
              report, "Educating Undergraduates in the Research
University." Underlying the
              conference focus is the broader goal for research universities: (1) to
define
              and articulate a vision of undergraduate education that builds upon and is
              synergistic
with their research mission, and (2) to develop reasonable
              expectations for implementing this
vision so that it impacts significant
              numbers of students.
Understanding the role of undergraduate research and
              mechanisms for realizing broader
participation is a first step toward this
              goal. In their efforts to infuse research into the
undergraduate education,
              those in leadership roles in research universities confront the
same panoply
              of issues and challenges that surround their larger efforts at reinvention.
              Thus
the conference focus on undergraduate research provides a concrete and
              manageable way to
address these issues.
