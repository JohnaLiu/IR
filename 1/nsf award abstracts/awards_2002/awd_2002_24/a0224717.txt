Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to improve recombinant expression systems.  The
              major goals are to discover and characterize pathways that facilitate protein
              folding and subunit assembly in hyperthermophiles.  The components of these
              pathways will be inserted into recombinant host cells to preempt induction of
              stress responses during recombinant expression, and to enhance the
              stabilization and solubilization of recombinant protein.  Building on the
              approach and findings of the investigators previous research, the specific
              objectives are: (1) to determine the functions of interacting proteins encoded
              by the 23 genes in the heat shock regulon of the hyperthermophile, Pyrococcus
              furiosus, (2) to identify functional complexes of thermostable heat shock
              proteins and express them in E. coli, yeast and mammalian cells to enhance the
              durability of these cells, and (3) to determine the effects of combinations of
              chaperonins on high level recombinant expression of proteins in intact cells as
              well as cell-free
transcription-translation systems.
