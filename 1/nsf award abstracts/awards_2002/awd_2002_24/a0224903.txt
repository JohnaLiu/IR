Abstract    :
              A long-standing controversy in mid-ocean ridge dynamics is whether upwelling
              beneath fast spreading ridges is sheet-like with a relatively uniform magma
              supply along axis, or more three-dimensional with diapiric-like upwelling near
              segment centers and lateral redistribution of melt along axis at shallow magma
              chamber levels and/or by lower crustal, ductile flow.  The UNDERSHOOT
              experiment was designed to address this problem by mapping the pattern of magma
              delivery from the mantle to the crust along the entire length of a transform
              bounded segment of the East Pacific Rise between the Siqueiros and Clipperton
              fracture zones.  The quality of the data are the important issues that remain
              warrant further analyses.  Models of crustal thickness will be refined by
              employing improved algorithms that allow all data collected in the experiment
              to be modeled simultaneously.  Understanding of the properties of the Moho
              transition and uppermost mantle will be improved.  Improved models of along
              axis variations in the structure of the mantle and lower crust low velocity
              zones will be developed.
