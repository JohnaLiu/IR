Abstract    :
              "Family Science:  Expanding Community Support for Inquiry-based Science" is the
              University of Washington's innovative five-year plan for reaching youth and
              families in the Seattle school district.  This program represents an
              enhancement of the NSF-funded Family Science program targeting grades K-5 and
              expansion of this successful program to include middle and high school
              students.  The proposed activities, Science Explorations, Inquiry Science
              Conferences and Community Celebrations, are designed to help parents understand
              inquiry-based science instruction while heightening students' confidence in
              their ability to understand science processes.  The hands-on activities also
              support and complement Seattle's Local Systemic Change project by enlisting
              teachers, parents and community members to champion science education outside
              of the formal school setting.  The implementation strategy includes workshops
              to train Family Science Lead Teachers and Parent/Community Leaders to
              coordinate Family Science programs.   Subsequent partnerships between teachers
              and community organizations are designed to establish regional clusters of
              community networks to support programmatic activities during and beyond the
              funding period.  It is estimated that Family Science will result in the
              presentation of nearly 300 school and community-based events impacting 10,000
              individuals.
