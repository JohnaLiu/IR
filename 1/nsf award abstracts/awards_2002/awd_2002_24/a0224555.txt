Using Planetarium Presentations

This project introduces students
              to the foundations of earth and atmospheric processes using planetarium
              presentations as an out-of-classroom learning milieu.  This project develops a
              curriculum ensemble on the topic of thunderstorms, with a concentration on
              lightning. The curriculum targets students in grades 5 through 8 and includes
              both a multi-media sky-dome program (slides, video, simulations) and companion
              written and laboratory materials with inquiry-based exercises. These materials
              are the first in a series of curriculum ensembles (covering climate, weather
              and the water cycle) for dissemination through planetarium facilities. Learning
              modules on thunderstorms and lightning are currently available in several
              formats, including web-based modules, conventional texts, video or film
              presentations, and as static displays in museums. However, planetarium
              facilities have typically been by-passed in the development of thunderstorm and
              lightning curriculum materials. The planetarium environment facilitates
              demonstration of lightning detection from space, for example, through data
              collected by NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, Lightning Imaging
              Sensor, and Optical Transient Detector. In addition, field campaigns to
              validate lightning detection on the ground can be shown and described. Key
              questions in lightning research can be identified. Participation by faculty and
              students in diverse academic departments (atmospheric science, physics,
              education, visualization sciences) as well as at premier research institutions
              (NSSL) will demonstrably enhance the capacity at all those institutions to be
              actively engaged in transferring research to education for elementary and
              secondary students.
