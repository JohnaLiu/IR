CISE RR:  Advancing Vidualization Projects Through the Use of
              High-Performance Virtual Reality Systems

This proposal from an EPSCoR state,
              fostering development in computer visualization research, aims at acquiring
              equipment to support North Dakota's State University Archeological Technologies
              Lab.  The research involves the use of compelling digital visualization
              experiences and authentic simulated virtual worlds to support the following
              projects:

1.	Virtual reconstruction of Like-a-Fishhook Village (to be
              displayed at the Heritage Center - state museum - in Bismarck and the Cultural
              Center of Three Affiliated Tribes in New Town),
2.	Virtual reconstruction of
              On-a-Slant Village (for display at the Fort Abraham Lincoln Museum in Mandan),
              and
3.	Immersive virtual environment of a Native American powwow-dancing
              competition for use in diabetes prevention in Native American youth.

An SGI
              Reality Center as a state-or-the-art technology augmentation to current NDSU
              facility and computer visualization capabilities will contribute to the virtual
              reconstructions of the villages and the computer simulation game for diabetes
              education.  The work facilitates projects in archeology, anthropology, and
              museology.  Expecting to develop and host a variety of virtual 3D environments
              at the highest levels and to send the virtual worlds to multiple remote
              location for concurrent display, the equipment and requisite software systems
              will constitute a qualitative leap in the capabilities to share high-detail 3D
              content for both research and education.
