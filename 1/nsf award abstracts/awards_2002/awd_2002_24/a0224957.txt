This project will investigate the effects of the iceberg,
              B-15, on the emperor
penguin population at Cape Crozier. The population of
              this southernmost of emperor
penguin colonies, although sometimes fluctuating
              radically, had steadily grown in past
years, with as many as 1200 chicks
              counted. This probably represented an adult
population of 2400-3000 birds.
              However, in 2001, after B-15 ground into the Cape
Crozier area during the
              winter breeding period, no live emperor chicks were found. The
colony had
              disappeared. The goal of this project is to determine if the colony will
              re-
establish itself at Cape Crozier or relocate nearby to a different site.
              If the colony
reestablishes at Cape Crozier, we will estimate the previous
              year's loss with a census of
the chicks present this year. The destruction of
              the colony site by the iceberg in 2001
represents a natural experiment to
              examine the resilience of breeding emperors to short
term disasters. Broader
              impacts of this study are related to the historical importance and
worldwide
              interest in this colony as it was the first emperor colony discovered, and
              has
probably the longest census record of any penguin colony.
