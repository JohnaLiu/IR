Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for renovation of the seawater system at the
              University of Texas - Pan American Coastal Studies Laboratory (CSL) on South
              Padre Island, Texas.  The CSL supports research and educational activities of
              the University, and provides a variety of public education activities focused
              on marine life and related topics.  The CSL is currently hampered in fulfilling
              this mission by the limited capabilities of its seawater system.  These limits
              are imposed by the original design of the system, deterioration of the intake
              and discharge lines, and the aging of other equipment.  The renovated system
              will have dual intake lines and pumps, sand-filtration, new plumbing for
              filtered water, and twin discharge lines. The system will support research on
              marine algae, seagrasses, and small marine animals.  In addition to research,
              the seawater system will support general lab use, university and public
              outreach courses, and an aquarium intended for public displays.
