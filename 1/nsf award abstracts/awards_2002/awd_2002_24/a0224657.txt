Description:  This award supports US-India cooperative
              research entitled Fabrication of Doped Single-Mode Optical Fibers for
              Investigation of Bragg-Grating Characteristics.  The collaborators are Anup
              Sharma of Alabama A&M University (AAMU) and Har Narayan Acharya of the Indian
              Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IITKgp).  They will examine issues related
              to the fabrication of specifically doped single-mode optical fibers and
              followup with an investigation of the Bragg-grating characteristics that are
              written in these fibers.  The researchers will utilize the unique capabilities
              and expertise offered by  each participating institution to accomplish the
              research objectives.  The IITKgp specializes in optical fiber preform and
              single-mode fabrication; AMMU is a leader in characterizing Bragg- gratings in
              optical fibers.  Fiber Bragg-gratings have numerous important applications in
              sensing and communications.  The research goals include developing a novel
              scheme for fiber sensing of strain and temperature.     

Scope:  This
              activity will initiate a new international collaboration with a competent group
              of Indian materials scientists and will promote the participation of
              under-represented groups in research.  A doctoral student will accompany the PI
              on trips to the IITKgp where he will learn about the modified chemical vapor
              deposition techniques; likewise, the Indian collaborator will gain exposure to
              fabrication techniques developed at AAMU.  This proposal has strong educational
              aspects and there is a good chance that the investigators will produce novel
              results.  The Indian Department of Science and Technology (DST) jointly
              supports this activity under the NSF/DST program.
