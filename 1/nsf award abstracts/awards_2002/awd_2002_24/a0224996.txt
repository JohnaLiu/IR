Abstract    :
              This award supports U.S. participation in a conference to be held
in January
              2003 in Cuernavaca, Mexico.  The conference, titled
"Complex Geometry and
              Dynamics," is being organized in honor of
Alberto Verjovsky of the Universidad
              Nacional Autonoma de Mexico
and will range widely over the fields of dynamics
              and geometry.

The award will fund conference travel expenses of 25
              junior
U.S. participants and several speakers.  A special feature of
              the
conference that will particularly serve the junior participants
is a set
              of short courses offered by M. Brunella, E. Ghys, and
Y. Eliashberg.
