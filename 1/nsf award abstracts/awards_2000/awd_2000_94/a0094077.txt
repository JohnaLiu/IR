Abstract    :
              Professor Feng Gai of the University of Pennsylvania is supported by the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry CAREER program to study protein folding
              dynamics.  The principal objective of this work is to study protein spontaneous
              fluctuations and folding dynamics at both single molecule and ensemble levels. 
              Laser-induced temperature-jump methods for rapid refolding/unfolding initiation
              and two-dimensional time-resolved infrared correlation and fluorescence
              spectroscopies, some in confocal geometries, will be used to study the early
              folding events.  Secondary structure formation in alanine-based helical
              peptides, helix-helix interation in GCN4-p1 and other helical bundles, and the
              folding mechanism of an all-beta-sheet protein, the E. Coli major cold shock
              protein A, will be studied.  Isotope editing will be used in order to achieve
              high structural resolution.  

Many modern biophysical techniques are
              appropriate for undergraduate research.  The PI plans to include undergraduates
              in this work, and also will be involved in public science education through
              special summer programs designed for local high school students at the
              University of Pennsylvania.
