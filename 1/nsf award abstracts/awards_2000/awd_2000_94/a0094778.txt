Abstract    :
              These scholarships target recruitment and retention of low income, high
              achieving high school and community college students to study computer science,
              engineering and technology (CSET) at Texas A& M University. Eighty scholarships
              are funded over the two year program. The Program combines financial aid,
              industry mentors, peer mentors, and seminars. These support activities offset
              deficiencies in financial and social capital that negatively impact recruitment
              and retention of high academic potential, high financial need students in CSET
              fields in the university.
