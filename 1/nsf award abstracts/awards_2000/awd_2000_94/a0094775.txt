Abstract    :
              This program increases the opportunities for academically talented, but
              financially disadvantaged, students to succeed. The scholarship recipients work
              with a specially designated advisor who to maximize the effectiveness of the
              existing university support programs in the following areas: financial aid
              planning, including securing additional aid, academic program planning,
              achievement progress and supplemental assistance, and career planning through a
              selected in- field experience such as co- op or internship programs, or
              academic activities with faculty. The program represents one component of the
              ongoing efforts at the institution to improve the education of students in
              engineering, mathematics and computer science, and to increase the retention of
              students to degree attainment.
