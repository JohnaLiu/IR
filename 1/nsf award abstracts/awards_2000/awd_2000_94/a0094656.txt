Abstract    :
              This project provides 50 scholarships for low-income students to obtain
              associate degrees in Computer Science, Mathematics, pre- Engineering, or
              Electrical Engineering. The project also provides academic enhancement and
              mentoring, along with career exploration and placement activities. Scholarship
              recipients receive $1,000 per semester, renewable for up to four semesters,
              which covers tuition, fees, and most books for a 12- hour semester. The project
              is designed to help and encourage scholarship recipients to matriculate into
              four-year institutions or to become gainfully employed in an SMET area.
