Abstract    :
              The Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics Scholarship Project provides
              55 scholarship awards of $895 per semester to full-time, academically talented,
              Pell-eligible students who are enrolled in programs leading to the Associate in
              Applied Science (AAS) or Associate in Science degree in computer information
              systems, electronics computer technology, electronics manufacturing technology,
              networking technology, computer science, engineering, or mathematics. The CSEMS
              project is being implemented at the partner colleges of Glendale Community
              College (GCC) and South Mountain Community College (SMCC), two schools who have
              led systemic reform initiatives in mathematics and science curriculum through
              the ACE (Achieving a College Education) Program. First implemented in the
              1980's, these ACE 2+2+2 programs target low income, first generation, and
              minority students beginning in their sophomore year of high school and have
              been nationally- recognized for success in retaining "at risk", predominately
              Hispanic, students in the pipeline which leads to associate and baccalaureate
              degrees. The CSEMS project adapts from the ACE program these primary student
              support strategies: 1) Individual Education Plans (IEP); 2) academic support
              services (i.e., tutoring, study strategies); 3) faculty/industry representative
              mentors for students; 4) ongoing monitoring/tracking with early intervention
              services as required; 5) monthly special events/activities that provide student
              interaction with faculty/industry representatives and applicant ion-oriented
              experiences (i.e., field trip s to high tech workplaces);and 6) job placement
              services as appropriate. Project evaluation includes ongoing monitoring of
              performance outcomes, annual student/mentor surveys, and post-graduate
              placement of students in either jobs or continuing higher education programs.
