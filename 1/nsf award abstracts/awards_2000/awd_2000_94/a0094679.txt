Abstract    :
              This project provides 5 scholarships for talented, but financially challenged
              students pursuing baccalaureate degrees in computer science, engineering and
              mathematics. The students are strongly encouraged to participate in
              undergraduate research and to present their results to related academic and
              professional organizations. Additional, they are encourage to become mentors in
              the Upward Bound/Math Science program and to assist local industry partners in
              solving specific problems related to their course of study. Each scholarship
              recipient receives enhanced student support, in the form of mentoring
              opportunities and a targeted job fair, in addition to the college's existing
              support through the residential house system, freshman advising program and
              academic honor system.
