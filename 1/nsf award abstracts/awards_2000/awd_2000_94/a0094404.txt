Abstract    :
              James Boncella (University of Florida) is supported by the Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for his work with early
              transition metal imido/amido compounds. The presence of several pi donors in
              the coordination sphere and the two electron change between M(IV) and M(VI),
              where M= Mo or W, provide an opportunity for unusual reactivity.  Complexes
              such as (N,N-bis(trimethylsilyl)-o-phenylenediamide)M(=NPh)(arene) show olefin
              polymerization and hydrogenation activity. The arylimido and -amido ligands
              will be modified to determine the effects on bonding and reactivity,
              particularly oxidative addition. The complexes will also be used to model
              hydrodesulfurization using sulfur-containing substrates such as thiophene and
              hydrodeoxygenation chemistry using oxygenated aromatics. 

This fundamental
              study will explore the effects of subtle changes in a metal complex. Study of
              these organometallic species may lead to a new understanding of industrial
              processes such as olefin polymerization, hydrogenation, hydrodesulfurization
              and hydrodeoxygenation.
