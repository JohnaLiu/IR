Abstract    :
              This project provides financial assistance to eligible students in the computer
              science degree program. A panel of instructors evaluates each applicant's
              potential for success in completion of the computer science degree and selects
              the participants. Selected participants receive tuition and books paid for by
              the grant. In addition to financial assistance the scholarship recipients meet
              with the computer science advisor/ mentor on a bi-monthly basis during the
              semester. This helps monitor their progress and assure their success in the
              program. A series of workshops are held to assist the students throughout the
              program. The project capitalizes on the strengths of the Mentoring Model to
              work with students as they move through the computer science degree program.
