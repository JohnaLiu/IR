Abstract    :
              Oleg Prezhdo of the University of Washington is supported by a CAREER grant from
              the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop and employ
              nonadiabatic molecular dynamics to study differences in chemical reactivity
              between gas- and solution-phase due to nonradiative relaxation.  Applications
              include the photoisomerization and cyclization of cis-stilbene, and the
              photochemistry of chlorine dioxide relevant to stratospheric ozone depletion. 
              As part of his education plan, Prezhdo will equip undergraduate physical
              chemistry courses with lecture templates and computational exercises in
              statistical mechanics, develop a graduate-level special topics class, and
              collaborate with Eastern European universities on distance learning.
              

Molecular mechanisms of energy flow associated with chemical events in
              solution will be investigated by theoretical methods developed to treat
              condensed phase simulations.  These studies will reveal the importance of
              quantum dynamical effects in processes of relevance to materials and
              biochemistry.  This research is closely aligned with complementary educational
              activities including course development and international cooperation.
