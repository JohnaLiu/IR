Abstract    :
              This project implements academic success strategies: accelerated learning
              groups, supplemental instruction, industry mentoring, and self- efficacy
              training in order to measurably increase student success. The Accelerated
              Learning Groups consist of the NSF scholars and an equal group of
              overrepresented computer science and engineering students. The broad evaluation
              plan ranges from simple statistics on retention and GPA to measures of
              motivation and the tools are chosen to aid student success, and to provide data
              publishable in peer- review journals.
