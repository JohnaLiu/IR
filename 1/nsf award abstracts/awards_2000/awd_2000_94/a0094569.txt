This grant is funded jointly by the Materials Theory Program
              in Division of Materials Research and the Mathematical Physics Program in the
              Physics Division.  The research is part of a broader program involving
              experiments, computation and mathematics.  The following projects will be
              undertaken: development of computer codes aimed at understanding the similarity
              solutions occurring near singularities; further application of the methods of
              statistical physics to the development of dynamical theories for the motion of
              interfaces, particularly the interfaces between two fluids;  the development 
              of models for chaotic and turbulent behavior, particularly the continuation of
              studies of turbulence in extended systems while addressing the problems related
              to the chaotic behavior of dynamical systems models with many degrees of
              freedom; and, the study of granular materials, with particular reference to
              their chaotic dynamical behavior.

              program involving experiments, computation and mathematics.  Theoretical
              research will take place on a variety of topics including singularities,
              interfaces, turbulence and chaos in fluids, and the chaotic behavior of
              granular materials.
