This PECASE award to Professor
              Michael Fitzgerald of Duke University is supported by the Analytical and
              Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division.  The primary research
              objective is to develop a mass spectrometry based method to examine protein
              stability and folding.  The experimental technique of hydrogen-deuterium
              exchange combined with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass
              spectrometry has several advantages over existing techniques for studying
              protein folding.  The long-range goals of this research are to develop a method
              to study complex binding interactions between multiple proteins and DNA.  The
              educational component of this program is both innovative and well developed. 
              Dr. Fitzgerald presents a program focused on a summer workshop for high school
              science teachers.  He collaborated with the school district science specialist
              in the development of the plan, which has also received the support of eight
              regional principals. 

This research will impact the fields of mass
              spectrometry and biochemistry.  Compared to established methods, this method is
              not limited by sample purity and will have greater sensitivity.  It is designed
              to be automated and fast. Future applications of this line of research could
              impact the study of both disease state and normal human health.
