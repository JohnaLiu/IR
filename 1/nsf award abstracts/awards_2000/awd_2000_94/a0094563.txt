SGER: A whole-ecosystem isotope labeling
              experiment: History and research opportunities


The investigators are
              tracing excess radiocarbon that was released in late summer 1999 to determine
              the rates of exchange of carbon between the atmosphere and a hardwood forest in
              eastern Tennessee. The radiocarbon is measurable only with very sensitive
              techniques and the investigators state that it is not associated with
              environmental risk. Dr. Trumbore is investigating how long it takes for the
              excess 14C fixed by trees in July/August 1999 to move through leaf, roots and
              woody plant tissues, soil organic matter, fungi and decomposer organisms, and
              CO2 produced in the soils.  The work is being performed in collaboration with a
              group of researchers at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The understanding of
              rates of carbon uptake and release by ecosystems gained from this study will be
              relevant to basic ecosystem science (understanding tree physiology and carbon
              allocation) as well as to predictions of the capacity of forest ecosystems to
              sequester carbon.
