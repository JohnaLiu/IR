Abstract    :
              The college is a public, Hispanic -serving, two year associate degree granting
              college charged with advancing the state's economic development by educating a
              skilled workforce. This project is creating a National Science Foundation
              Scholarship (NSF) program for five computer related technologies. Students
              receive, upon completion of study, an associate of applied science degree in
              one of five areas: Computer Science Technology, Computerized Drafting and
              Design Technology, Computerized Digital Imaging Technology, Computerized
              Network Information Management Technology, and Computer Maintenance Technology.
              Scholarship recipients are being selected on the basis of a submitted
              application, interviews, a written statement on choosing a computer related
              field, and assessment of career goals. The scholarship awards are being
              integrated into the overall recruitment and retention efforts of the College
              which includes specific initiatives for outreach and recruitment to Hispanic
              families. Intensive retention strategies such as assessment methods using the
              Noel- Levitz Retention Management System, intrusive academic advising, a
              structured first year student success course, supplemental instruction,
              tutoring and mentoring, and the establishment of learning assistance centers
              provide scholarship students with a strong retention infrastructure for student
              success as measured by persistence until graduation.
