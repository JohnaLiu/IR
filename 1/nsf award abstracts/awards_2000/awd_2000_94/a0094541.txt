Abstract    :
              This project will continue cosmological observations with the Degree Angular
              Scale Interferometer (DASI) at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole station.  The DASI
              instrument is currently providing measurements of the cosmic microwave
              background (CMB) radiation anisotropy over a range of scales that span the
              first three acoustic peaks in the CMB power spectrum.  The shape of the power
              spectrum, in particular the spacing of the peaks, provides a potentially clean
              measure of the geometry of the universe.  Other DASI studies include the
              measuring of currently undetected polarization of the CMB anisotropy.  This
              information will provide a critical test of the early structure of the
              universe.  Also, the receiver will be reconfigured for higher frequencies in
              order to measure the fine scale anisotropy and the tail of the CMB anisotropy
              power spectrum.  Education and outreach efforts will proceed in parallel with
              DASI reconfiguration, testing, observing, and analysis; an undergraduate
              hands-on course on radio telescopes is being developed as part of this work,
              with a teachers workshop planned for the first year of this renewal.  All
              reduced and calibrated data, fully described, will be publicly available within
              one year after the completion of the project.
