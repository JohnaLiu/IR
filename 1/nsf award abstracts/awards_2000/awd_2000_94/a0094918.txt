Abstract    :
              This is a scholarship program for academically talented students in computer
              science, mathematics and engineering, with a special emphasis on
              African-Americans. Recruitment efforts involve pre-college programs such as
              Upward Bound and the Packard Program, along with area community and two-year
              technical colleges, and students enrolled in CSEMS areas. Objectives of the
              program include: (1) increased representation of persons from this group among
              students studying for undergraduate and first graduate degrees in the above
              disciplines; (2) increased retention through graduation of participants; (3)
              development of a sense of belonging in the represented disciplines; (4)
              involvement of participants in a peer support network; and, (5) provision of
              mentoring and counseling opportunities to assist participants in coping with
              college life and preparing for graduate and professional opportunities.
              Scholars are formally recognized during the opening convocation in the fall and
              at the Academic Awards Day in the spring.
