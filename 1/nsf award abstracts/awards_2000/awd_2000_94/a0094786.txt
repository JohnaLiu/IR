Abstract    :
              The goal of the Computing, Mathematics and Engineering (CMET) Capstone Scholars
              program is to provide opportunities to low-income, academically talented
              students that strengthens their "academic connections" to the university and
              thereby fosters their continuing full-time enrollment and degree completion in
              computing, mathematics, and engineering technology. Each scholar works with a
              faculty mentor, and participates in existing support activities as well as a
              new series of seminars related to their discipline area; these activities lead
              to a required capstone experience. Special tracking services enable the
              scholars to stay on target academically.
