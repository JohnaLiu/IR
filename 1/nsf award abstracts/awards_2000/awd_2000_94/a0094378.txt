Abstract    :
              Total syntheses of alleopathic (compounds implicated in the chemical interaction
              of plants) natural products isolated from the sunflower, the heliannuols, and
              related natural products will be synthesized based on a biomimetic
              phenol-epoxide cyclization strategy.  Bioassays on synthetic intermediates and
              target molecules will be carried out to evaluate their activity as potential
              herbicides.  The teaching component of the plan will result in the development
              of a new medicinal chemistry course for majors and the introduction of simple
              research projects into the undergraduate organic chemistry lab course.  The
              students must design portions of the experiments themselves by performing
              online literature searches thus giving them a more "research-like"
              experience.

With this CAREER award, the Organic Synthesis Program is
              supporting the research and educational activities of Professor James R. Vyvyan
              of the Department of Chemistry at Western Washingtion University, a primarily
              undergraduate institution.  Professor Vyvyan's research is directed towards the
              synthesis of chemicals isolated from the sunflower and the evaluation of their
              ability to inhibit the growth of troublesome weed species.  The educational
              portion of the plan will develop new research-based laboratory experiments for
              the organic chemistry lab course and emphasize the relevancy of agricultural
              and medicinal chemistry in lecture courses.
