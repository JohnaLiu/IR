This regional award provides support from the Division of
              International Programs and the Division of Materials Research for a workshop
              organized by Dr. Irving A. Lerch of the American Physical Society and Dr. Cylon
              Goncalves da Silva, Director of the Brazilian Association for Synchrotron Light
              Technology (ABTLuS).  This workshop on the Use of Synchrotron Radiation for
              Research will be held at the National Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) in
              Campinas, Brazil in February 2001 and includes a Symposium on Nanotechnology. 
              The scientific participants come from the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil,
              Venezuela, Argentina, as well as from countries outside the Western Hemisphere.
               The workshop will be short, focused and research-oriented in specific areas of
              synchrotron research and nanotechnologies. Two or more specialized symposia are
              organized around atomic and molecular spectroscopy, surface physics and
              catalysis, soft matter and polymers, x-ray structural studies, and
              nanotechnologies.  The symposium will be used to train several postdoctoral
              students from the hemisphere and also bring in more users to the LNLS facility.
              
Workshops such as this nurture future international collaborations and help
              unify the global community.  They also expose young scientists to international
              science and expand their horizons.  This workshop will help increase the user
              base in Latin America for the seven major synchrotron facilities in the
              U.S.
