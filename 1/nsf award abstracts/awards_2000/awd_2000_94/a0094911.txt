Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, addresses the question of the reactivity of organic molecules with the
              surface of liquid sulfuric acid solutions.  Instrumentation is developed that
              allows the study of surface reaction, diffusion and bulk partitioning of
              reactant products, and identification of desorbed product species, under
              conditions relevant to atmospheric acid aerosol chemistry.  Kinetics and
              mechanisms of these organic molecule reactions as a function of surface
              temperature, water vapor pressure, acid composition, and organic reactant flux
              are examined.  A basic understanding of the physical chemistry of gas-liquid
              interactions, and tropospheric aerosol chemistry is the outcome of this project
              carried out in the laboratory of Professor Jeffrey Roberts at the University of
              Minnesota. 

Very little is known about the mechanisms and kinetics of
              gas-liquid surface reactions.  This research project addresses the kinetics and
              mechanisms of organic molecule reactions with the surface of sulfuric acid
              liquids, using an apparatus directly developed for these studies.  The results
              of these investigations are relevant to an understanding of tropospheric
              aerosol chemistry.
