Abstract    :
              Professor Jeffrey Yarger of the University of Wyoming is funded by the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program as a CAREER award to perform
              experiments aimed at developing a new understanding of phase transitions in
              polyamorphic solids.  To date, the only demonstration of polyamorphism is in
              solid water.  Because of the importance of water, it is therefore of great
              interest to understand polyamorphism and to seek other examples.  The PI will
              look for such effects in other tetrahedrally bound systems such as BeF2.  The
              approach is to use cutting edge NMR and light scattering methods such as
              Brillouin spectroscopy.  The PI will also introduce laser based light
              scattering into the physical chemistry laboratory class, with an emphasis on
              making the experiments relevant to biochemistry students. 

The increasing
              need for novel material properties provides some of the motivation for study of
              amorphous materials and their phase transitions.  Additionally, this research
              could help us to understand some of the unusual properties of water.  The
              training of biochemistry majors in physical methods will be of great benefit as
              biological advances depend to a greater extent on sophisticated technology.
