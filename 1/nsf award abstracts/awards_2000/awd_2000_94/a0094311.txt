Abstract    :
              This CAREER project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
              addresses the detailed interactions of reactive radicals with well
              characterized semiconductor surfaces.  Using molecular beam scattering methods,
              the interaction of hyperthermal ions and radicals with the Si(100) and (111)
              surfaces will be examined.  Effects of rotational steering in interhalogen
              reactants, chemical selectivity in the reactions, atom abstraction processes,
              and reactions with adsorbed layers will be studied to provide insight into
              these reactions of fundamental importance to semiconductor processing.  A
              program will be developed to include high school teachers in the basic research
              associated with this project, in order to foster increased understanding of
              current technology and its application.  This program will impact  high school
              teachers and their students through participation in cutting edge research
              during the summers, and follow up with classroom activities throughout the
              school year. 

The fundamental interactions of small reactive ions and
              radicals with semiconductor surfaces forms the research basis of this CAREER
              project.  Involving local high school teachers in the basic research effort
              during summers, and outreach to their classrooms during the academic year,
              forms its educational basis.  Molecular beam scattering methods coupled with
              spectroscopic characterization of silicon surfaces will allow the research
              group of Professor Sean Casey at the University of Nevada-Reno to examine the
              fundamentals of these surface reactions which are of significant importance to
              the area of semiconductor processing.
