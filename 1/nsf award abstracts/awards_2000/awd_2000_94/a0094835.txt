Abstract    :
              This program provides scholarships to engineering and computer science students
              in the lower divisions of Portland State University and Portland Community
              College, who have a co-admission policy. These scholarships increase the number
              of full-time, under-represented students in the engineering and computer
              science programs. Students participate in planned support activities, including
              a two-week summer high school-to-college bridge program, monitoring student
              progress, and cohort-building events. Building on the existing NSF Computer
              Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships Program for the upper
              division, these scholarships provide an integrated scholarship program from
              high school and community college through college graduation.
