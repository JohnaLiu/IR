Dr. Hanson will
              carry out an extensive observational and theoretical research program to
              develop a quantitative spectroscopic analysis capable of directly studying the
              physical environment and characteristics of massive stars at their birth.  The
              spectroscopic analysis will be developed and applied entirely at near-infrared
              wavelengths, from 1.5 to 2.5 microns.  This unprecedented view will allow
              astronomers to directly detect young stars while they are still entirely
              shrouded in their birth clouds.  The PI seeks to find critical signatures
              present in the spectrum and environment of the star which yield clues to the
              formation process of massive stars.  Quantitative spectroscopic analysis will
              yield information on the properties of these young stars, such as temperature,
              gravities, abundances, and rotation, nearly a million years before they would
              be observed optically.  The study also includes very deep, near-infrared images
              of the fields of these massive young stars, to investigate cluster properties. 
              The research program will emphasize the involvement of undergraduate and
              graduate students. 

This award will also support Dr. Hanson's involvement in
              a community outreach program designed to bring science and science education to
              Cincinnati youth.  Middle and high school students will be given lessons on a
              series of hands-on physics projects, where they will have the opportunity to
              learn and work the projects themselves.  They will then present these projects
              as a lesson to younger children.  The youth science program represents a joint
              effort with the Division of Teacher Education in the College of Education and
              the Department of Physics at the University of Cincinnati.  Although every
              student involved will benefit from the program, the aim is to uncover young
              people who might go on to become high school teachers.
