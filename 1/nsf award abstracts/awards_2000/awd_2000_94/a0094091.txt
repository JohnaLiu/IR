Abstract    :
              With this new award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
              the work of Dr. Robert A. Flowers at the University of Toledo in Toledo, Ohio. 
               The research aims to develop a fundamental understanding of the equilibria and
              kinetics of the reactions involved in the use of Sm(II) reagents as reducing
              agents in organic chemistry.   The work will involve determining the structures
              and aggregation states of SmI2 reducing agents in solution, and the influence
              of cosolvent (ligands) on the reactivity of the reagents, as well as developing
              a bulk electrolysis method to make the reductions catalytic in Sm.   A variety
              of physical methods will be used, including vapor pressure osmometry,
              isothermal titration calorimetry, vis/uv absorption spectrometry, stopped flow
              kinetic methods, electrochemistry, and x-ray crystallography.

The proposed
              research involves studies to understand the behavior of an important class of
              reducing agents based on Sm(II) which are used by organic chemists to carry out
              useful syntheses.   The work is expected to lead to improved reaction
              conditions with higher yields of desired product and less undesired byproducts,
              and may lead to new reducing systems using electricity and only very small
              (catalytic) amounts of samarium.   The work is expected to provide excellent
              training for the students involved.
