Abstract    :
              This project is: (1) Improving education for students in computer science,
              engineering and mathematics, (2) Increasing retention of students to degree
              completion, (3) Improving professional development, job placement and further
              higher education placement of participating students, and (4) Strengthening
              partnerships between institutions of higher education and related employment
              sectors. Students receive benefits from participating with ongoing academic
              enhancement and training activities which offer collaborative research
              activities and internships with various information technology associated
              firms. The project includes both undergraduate and graduate students.
