Abstract    :
              Ongoing research at Lawrence Technological University (LTU) have lead the City
              of Southfield, Michigan, to authorize the construction of the first CFRP
              prestressed concrete bridge in the USA. The conceptual design of this bridge
              system is based on research investigations funded by NSF and conducted at LTU.
              Parallel to this innovative Bridge, a three-span bridge will be constructed
              using conventional materials. The objective of the proposed investigation is to
              provide the undergraduate student research team with the opportunity to
              experimentally compare, and verify the design approach and the performance of
              various structural components of both bridge systems. The investigation will
              result in valuable information that can be adopted in the construction of
              future CFRP bridges
