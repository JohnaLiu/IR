Abstract    :
              The objective of this grant is to provide support for a series of workshops
              aimed at bringing focus to critical manufacturing technology challenges and
              fostering cooperative activity between government agencies, industry and
              academe.  Support for the workshops will be provided by NSF together with the
              Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the
              Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, and industry.  The workshops
              will address topics including shared knowledge repositories and learning
              systems; knowledge-based design; integrated, interoperable enterprises,
              especially web-based; science-based modeling and simulation for manufacturing;
              emerging manufacturing technologies and processes; web-enabled manufacturing;
              and intelligent controls.  The workshops will invite broad representation from
              all manufacturing domains to develop a comprehensive suite of goals and
              requirements for use in focusing manufacturing research and development.

If
              successful, this project will foster cooperation among government, industry and
              academe, and it will provide focus for Federal participation in manufacturing
              research and development.
