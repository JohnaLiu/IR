Abstract    :
              Dr. Jonathan Wilker, Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, is supported by
              the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program, Division of
              Chemistry, National Science Foundation, through a Career Award for his work on
              marine adhesives. Specifically, the work will investigate the protein adhesive
              precursor that contains high levels of 3,4-dihydroxyhenylalanine (DOPA), a
              known metal chelator produced by barnacles, mussels and reef-building worms. On
              the educational front, a new inorganic laboratory course will be designed to
              increase student enthusiasm and student learning outcomes; groups of students
              will conduct a laboratory and subsequently will teach the material that
              emphasizes synthesis and spectroscopic techniques to their
              classmates.

Understanding the role of metals in marine adhesives will aid in
              the design and development of new medical adhesive materials, antifoulants (of
              potential interest to the Navy), underwater adhesives, and rustproof coatings.
              Students involved in the self-teaching/teaching laboratory course will
              appreciate the art and science of teaching and perhaps generate an interest in
              pedagogy to potential science educators.
