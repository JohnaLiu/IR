Abstract    :
              We are targeting students pursuing associate or bachelors-level degrees and
              include a number of measurable objectives, including an increased retention/
              completion rate for CSEMS students. Scholarship holders are encouraged to seek
              internships or work place experiences with regional industry, as appropriate
              for their disciplines. These internships/ experiences may take place either
              during the academic year or summer.
