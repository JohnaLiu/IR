Abstract    :
              This project aims to develop a semi-quantitative understanding of the
              relationships between composition, crystal structure and the electronic
              structure in extended solids.  The focus is on oxide and oxynitride materials.
              The motivation is to use this knowledge to design new materials, or rediscover
              existing materials, with interesting optical, electrical and/or catalytic
              properties. Specific emphasis is given to the development of new materials
              where both the electrical and optical properties are important, such as
              photocatalysts and transparent conductors. The development of a photocatalytic
              material that can efficiently utilize visible light would have far reaching
              implications in the areas of environmental remediation and hydrogen generation.
              There are two aspects to the educational plan.  The first element involves
              improving the way general chemistry is taught by incorporating more aspects of
              active learning and group work into the recitation and laboratory sections. The
              second aspect of the educational plan is to develop a series of modules for use
              in teaching solid state chemistry at the graduate/advanced undergraduate level.
              The combined research and education components described here were chosen to
              enhance our understanding of structure-composition-property relations in solid
              state chemistry.

The need for new transparent conductors is driven by the
              increasing popularity of optoelectronic devices, such as flat panel displays,
              light emitting diodes, and solar cells. Students trained in the areas have a
              significant chance of competing well in these high-technology job markets.
