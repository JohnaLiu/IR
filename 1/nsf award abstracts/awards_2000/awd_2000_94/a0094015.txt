Abstract    :
              PI proposes to apply directed evolution to a novel direction of research: the
              improvement of viral gene delivery vehicles for gene therapy. In addition to
              generating vectors with enhanced performance, their approach may yield further
              insights into the biology of retroviruses. They plan develop both the lecture
              and laboratory course curriculum of the biotechnology focus of the
              undergraduate chemical engineering major to reflect the growing importance of
              diversity and directed evolution. In addition, they will create a graduate
              elective course in bioengineering that covers combinatorial chemistry and
              directed evolution, as well as the thematically related area of bioinformatics.
              Developing this curriculum would be part of our overall goal to train graduate
              and undergraduate students in the methods and practice of research. Their
              specific objectives of this proposal are:

1) To determine whether evolution
              of retroviral proteins can improve the efficiency and ease of production of
              retroviral vectors                                                             
                                                                                             
                     2) To examine if evolution of non-coding retroviral regions can overcome
              problems associated with safety and stability of expression after gene
              delivery
3) To develop the undergraduate biotechnology option lecture and
              laboratory course material to cover the importance of diversity in
              bioengineering and biotechnology
4) To develop a graduate elective course that
              integrates the topics of bioinformatics, biodiversity, combinatorial chemistry,
              and directed evolution.
