Abstract    :
              This project provides scholarships for mathematics and computer science majors.
              The program includes a mentoring seminar to be held two evenings per month,
              internships at major local companies, and the opportunity to work on research
              projects with faculty members. The recruiting plan includes working with a
              local community college to bring in more Native American students. Support
              structures incorporate existing programs which serve underrepresented groups as
              well as nontraditional age students. The program is designed to be not only a
              scholarship award but a concerted effort to keep these students from falling
              through the cracks.
