The main objective of this project is to explore the fundamental
              structure of the wind-driven gyre and its associated climate variability on
              decadal time scales. A hierarchy of models will be used in the study, including
              multi-layer ventilated models with and without a mixed layer; a model for a
              continuously stratified ocean; an analytical solution with continuous
              stratification; and oceanic general circulation models. The goals are: (1) to
              study the structure of the wind-driven circulation in a single hemispheric
              basin; (2) to study the transient response of the thermocline to decadal
              climate variability, in particular, the three-dimensional structure of the
              decadal variability in the thermocline; (3) to study mixed-layer properties and
              the associated climate variability, using simple analytical models and oceanic
              general circulation models with a mixed layer; (4) to use inverse methods to
              study the structure of the thermocline in order to understand the dynamic
              processes that set up the wind-driven circulation and control the climate
              variability; and (5) to study water mass formation (subduction and obduction)
              in the world ocean.
