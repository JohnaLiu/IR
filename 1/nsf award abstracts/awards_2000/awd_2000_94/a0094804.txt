Abstract    :
              Scholarships are offered to low-income, academically talented students to
              promote full-time enrollment and degree achievement in computer science,
              engineering technology or mathematics. Preference is given to eligible students
              who enter college for the first time, and then to those eligible students who
              will complete degree requirements within the time frame of the grant. We retain
              our students to degree achievement by supporting students through critical
              periods. Support programs are in place through the Office of Multi-Cultural
              Affairs, orientation and advising programs, and mentoring of students in the
              first math and physics courses. Strong industrial partnerships aid the scholars
              through their critical period of being employable before the degree is complete
              through workshops, and co-op and intern programs.
