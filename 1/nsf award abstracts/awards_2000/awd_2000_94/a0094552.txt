Abstract    :
              This project features the implementation of a coordinated campus- wide academic
              program for CSEMS scholarship recipients. The program provides enhanced access
              to academic resources, peer and faculty mentoring, and leadership and
              professional development. Scholarship recipients participate in the Master
              Student II course as a formal transition to UMR. Each student is assigned to a
              faculty mentor as part of the strategy to develop a significant measure of
              accountability and ensure that students are utilizing support resources while
              completing their academic program. Scholars are guided to utilize beneficial
              academic resources as well as to participate in leadership and professional
              development activities. Academic advisors assist in monitoring student academic
              progress.
