This CAREER award focuses on three topics: (1) the study of the
              exchange of matter between the surface and bulk of transition-metal-oxides
              mediated by defect diffusion using density functional theory and kinetic Monte
              Carlo techniques, (2) ab inito molecular dynamics will be used to investigate
              the effect of lattice defects on transition-metal-oxide surface chemistry, and
              (3) the study of transition-metal-carbide and -oxide nanocrystals.  The
              educational component involves developing "virtual labs" and introducing them
              into the undergraduate physics curriculum. Web-based software modules that
              provide a student friendly environment for simulating fundamental physical
              phenomena would be developed in three areas: (1) coupled oscillators, (2)
              activated processes, and (3) waves.

This is a CAREER award to support
              fundamental theoretical research and education on transition-metal-oxide
              surfaces and clusters of atoms, specifically transition-metal-carbide and
              -oxide clusters.  Computational electronic structure methods together with
              atomistic simulation techniques would be used to carry out the research.  The
              PI will also develop web-based simulation modules that illustrate fundamental
              physical principles. These will be integrated into the undergraduate
              curriculum.
