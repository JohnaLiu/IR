Abstract    :
              The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program of the Division
              of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, supports Dr. Shannon Stahl,
              Chemistry Department, University of Wisconsin at Madison, for his work under a
              Career Award. The project will involve (1)  mechanistic studies designed to
              clarify how palladium couples the oxidation of organic substrates to the
              reduction of dioxygen, and (2) application of mechanistic insights into
              developing novel oxidation catalysts. The award also supports development of a
              new freshman/sophomore course in introductory inorganic chemistry that will
              integrate modern research developments into classroom teaching, including such
              topics as transition metal catalysis, green chemistry, fuel cells and
              batteries, and elements of bioinorganic chemistry.

To the extent that
              selective oxidation of organic molecules lies at the heart of commodity and
              fine chemical industries, this work will facilitate the design of new, more
              efficient and selective oxidation catalysts. Graduate students and
              post-doctoral associates will be trained in an active area of current interest
              in catalysis. Undergraduate students will be exposed to and taught elements of
              chemistry that are currently of high research priority in the important spheres
              of green chemistry and energy.
