Abstract    :
              The investigators seek funding to continue a "National Data Program for the
              Social Sciences, " namely the General Social Survey (GSS).  The GSS has been
              monitoring social change in the United States, examining sub-groups in society,
              and studying social processes since 1972. Over this period 23 cross-sectional
              surveys of the US adult household population have been completed, involving
              face-to-face interviews with approximately 41,000 respondents. Surveys seek to
              document fundamental social change in areas such as uses of technology, social
              and cultural capital, neighborhoods and communities, social networks and racial
              and gender attitudes. The GSS has six components, a replicated core set of
              questions, modules developed on topical subjects, cross-national modules,
              experiments and reinterview and follow-up studies.  This grant will allow the
              GSS to continue these basic features and plans to conduct surveys in years 2002
              and 2004.
