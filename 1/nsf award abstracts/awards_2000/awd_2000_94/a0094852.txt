Abstract    :
              Students are provided with services and activities that are designed to promote
              the following: improve the undergraduate educational experience of students in
              relevant disciplines; 2) increase the number and percentage of students
              completing the first stage of the baccalaureate study and those student
              receiving degrees in relevant disciplines; 3) improve the likelihood of Program
              Scholars post- baccalaureate placement in employment or graduate programs in
              technical or related disciplines; and provide the opportunity to further
              strengthen partnerships with employers and the institution. Each scholar is
              paired with a mentor who is a member of the Program Scholars discipline area in
              which he/ she is pursuing his/ her baccalaureate degree; the mentor serves as
              an advocate for the scholars academic and career success. Activities that some
              of the scholars are involved in include: tutorial assistance, visitations to
              research laboratories and graduate programs, career counseling, attendance and/
              or participation in national professional conferences within their discipline
              and national student research conferences, writing assistance, and professional
              work experiences. The program focuses on students in engineering and
              engineering technology.
