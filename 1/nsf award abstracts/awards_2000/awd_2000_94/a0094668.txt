Both in electric power systems and in physics, the use of
              extremely high voltages -- many millions of volts -- has become increasingly
              common. For example, the Department of Energy has funded several large efforts
              to implement High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) systems designed to operate at
              10 million volts.  The design and analysis of such systems normally assumes
              that the ambient voltage (the A0 field) will not affect the behavior of power
              semiconductors or other systems. It assumes that the effects of high voltages
              are entirely based on the difference in voltage across a chip, rather than the
              ambient level of voltage as such. However, preliminary theoretical
              calculations, related to the Bohm-Aharonov paradox of quantum theory and the
              renormalization of propagator terms in quantum field theory, suggest that there
              may be direct effects as well, particularly when the ambient voltage levels
              reach 10-200 million volts DC. It is possible that some of these effects may be
              hazardous while others may provide positive technological opportunities, but it
              is far too early to know whether this is in fact true. The goals of this
              exploratory project are: (1) to perform more complete theoretical calculations,
              based on alternative models, to analyze the nature of these effects; (2) to
              evaluate options for future experiments, in order to test competing models and
              open the door to more complete analysis.
