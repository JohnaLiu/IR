Abstract    :
              This project provides scholarships to qualified majors in computer science,
              engineering and mathematics. Awardees are determined by a four step process
              emphasizing minority status, recommendation of the faculty, sophomore and
              junior level, Pell eligibility, and a screening committee. Mentoring and
              monitoring of the scholars' progress is led by faculty advisors in their
              respective disciplines. A component of the mentoring process involves the
              development of course of study responsive to the career goals of the individual
              scholars. In addition, each scholar is provided with an internship opportunity
              with local industries.
