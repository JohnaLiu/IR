Abstract    :
              Forty scholarships are provided to full- time, low- income, academically
              talented students, with special consideration given to minority and women
              students, in support of the following goals: 1) improved education for students
              in the computer science and engineering technology programs; 2) increased
              retention of students in those areas to degree achievement; 3) improved
              professional development and employment or further higher education placement
              of participating students; and 4) strengthened partnerships between
              institutions of higher education and related employment sectors. In addition to
              providing financial assistance, this CSEMS project provides a solid student
              support infrastructure that includes innovative multidisciplinary sessions,
              peer tutoring, effective networks with local businesses and industries, and
              operative articulation agreements with four- year institutions. CSEMS scholars
              complete academic testing to determine readiness for academic mathematics and
              science courses prior to enrolling in these courses. Appropriate developmental
              education is provided for those students who need additional background before
              entering science and technology courses. The CSEMS program provides
              professional development opportunities for students to increase student
              confidence and readiness for the workforce.
