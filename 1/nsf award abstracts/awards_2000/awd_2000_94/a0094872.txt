Abstract    :
              This project aims to develop a new direction in chalcogenide research concerned
              with the exploitation of hybrid metal chalcogenides composed of both organic
              and inorganic components. The goal of the research is to explore and develop
              effective solvothermal routes towards controlled synthesis of new, functional
              hybridized materials; to characterize and modify their structural, chemical,
              electronic and physical properties and to understand the correlation between
              these properties; and finally to acquire fundamental knowledge regarding the
              chemistry of inorganic-organic composite materials. The focus will be on (a)
              open-framework structures involving organic templates, and (b)
              inorganic-organic networks built upon chalcogen(Sulfur, Selenium, and
              Tellurium)-containing inorganic fragments that are interconnected by organic
              spacers via coordinate or covalent bonds.

Organic-inorganic hybrid
              composite materials are likely to combine superior electronic, magnetic,
              optical properties, and thermal stability of inorganic frameworks with the
              structural diversity, flexibility, high processability, and light-weight of
              organic molecules to further enhance and strengthen their functionality. The
              educational component of this proposal will be to continue to develop the
              Materials Initiative Program recently established at our campus and to involve
              a large number of both graduate and undergraduate students in the materials
              chemistry learning and in hands-on research training processes.
