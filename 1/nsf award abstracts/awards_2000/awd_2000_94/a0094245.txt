The research component of the project concerns with
              various aspects of
rigidity in Ergodic theory, Lie groups and Hyperbolic
              Geometry. The
common theme of the proposed research projects is the analysis
              of 
group actions on spaces endowed with a measurable, topological or
              
geometrical structure. More specifically, in the context of Ergodic
Theory
              the proposed problems address the structure and invariants 
of ergodic
              equivalence relations on probability spaces generated by
measurable actions of
              lattices in Lie groups. In the context of
Hyperbolic geometry the goal is to
              study negatively curved Riemannian 
structures on compact manifolds through
              coarse-geometric point of
view on the fundamental group.

Generally, the
              research component of the project is focused on 
dynamics and geometry of
              various systems which have a rich group
of symmetries in the search of special
              phenomena occurring due to
these symmetries. The educational component of the
              project is 
aimed to contribute to the graduate studies program via special
              
designed Workshop in Mathematics Seminar and advanced Topic courses. 
The
              goal is to engage students in small scale "self discovery" 
projects via sets
              of challenging problems, to encourage independent 
thinking and to expose
              students to a wide spectrum of current 
research.
