Abstract    :
              The enzyme pyruvate,orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) is most well known as
an
              enzyme of the C4 photosynthetic pathway where it catalyzes the
formation of
              PEP (phosphoenolpyruvate), the primary CO2 acceptor
molecule, from pyruvate.
              Because it is a key enzyme in the C4 pathway,
PPDK activity is highly
              regulated so the overall pathway can function
optimally in CO2 assimilation.
              This regulation is conferred by
reversible phosphorylation of a PPDK
              active-site threonine, with the
enzyme being inactive in the phosphorylated
              state. A single bifunctional
protein kinase/phosphatase enzyme, PPDK
              regulatory protein (RP),
catalyzes this regulatory phosphorylation and
              dephosphorylation. PPDK is
also present in C3 plants although it does not
              participate in
photosynthesis. Further, it is present in all tissues of the
              plant but
in very low amounts. Its function in C3 plants is essentially
              unknown,
although it is proposed to participate in cellular metabolism
              and
guard cell function. Recently, it was demonstrated that PPDK in leaves
of
              C3 plants undergoes light/dark mediated regulatory phosphorylation
similar to
              C4 leaf PPDK.  The major aim of this project is to further
characterize C3
              plant PPDK regulatory phosphorylation by identifying
organ, tissue, cellular,
              and subcellular sites of regulatory PPDK
phosphorylation. Further, the C3 RP
              or RP-like activity mediating
reversible phosphorylation of PPDK in C3 plant
              tissue will be
scrutinized in vitro for understanding its biochemical nature.
              Finally,
this project seeks to clone the gene for C4 PPDK RP from a maize
              cDNA
library. This will provide the "ultimate" tool for resolving
              the
perplexing riddle of how this uniquely bifunctional enzyme is
              regulated
in C4 plants, as well as the requisite gene probe for understanding
              its
precise expression in C3 and C4 plants. In summary, the
              experimental
outcomes of this project will enable the hitherto unknown
              metabolic
function(s) of PPDK in C3 plants to be elucidated.
