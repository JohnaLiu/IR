Abstract    :
              The Engineering/ Education Partnership Scholar Program is an innovative,
              interdisciplinary two- year scholarship program that seamlessly integrates
              professional development, community service, and technical education for low
              income engineering, computer science and applied mathematics undergraduates.
              Selected Partnership Scholars experience an intense and integrated educational
              program leading to an undergraduate degree in either engineering, computer
              science or applied math and an education minor resulting in initial New York
              State Teacher Certification. Scholars are provided with multiple advising and
              mentoring tracks starting in their second year. During the summer of their
              sophomore and junior year, they participate in special workshops designed to
              support professional development. In the summer between their junior and senior
              year, they work with secondary school students as mentors themselves as part of
              their teaching hours for the education minor. These major elements of the
              project combine to create a comprehensive development model for low- income
              students providing them with an integrated set of educational experiences
              leading to successful completion of both an engineering degree as well as
              initial Teacher Certification in New York State. A secondary and important
              objective of this program is the creation of a sustainable teacher- training
              model that significantly infuses technology- competent teachers into urban
              school systems.
