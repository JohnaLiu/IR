Abstract    :
              The proposed research focuses on asymmetric biaryl oxidative coupling reactions.
                Combinatorial type screening of ligands with transition metal oxidants will
              be undertaken to identify new, useful catalysts.  A variety of substrates and
              issues of chemo- and regioselectivity will be examined.  The educational
              component of this plan introduces graphics and internet examples into the
              undergraduate organic chemistry course as well as computional chemistry using
              CSC Chem3D Ultra.  Graduate and undergraduate students in the principal
              investigator's research group also receive training in computional
              chemistry.

With the CAREER award, the Organic Synthesis Program is
              supporting the research and educational activities of Professor Marisa
              Kozlowski of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania. 
              Professor Kozlowski's research applies concepts from computional and organic
              chemistry to design and synthesize new molecules which are useful as ligands
              for new catalysts or as building blocks for certain natural products.  The
              educational portion of the plan is directed towards using computional chemistry
              methods as a teaching tool at both the undergraduate and graduate level.
