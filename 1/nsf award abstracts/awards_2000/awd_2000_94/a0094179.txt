     The investigator develops, analyzes, and
              applies
computational techniques for the motion of elastic filaments
embedded
              in an incompressible fluid.  This general situation
arises in many physical
              contexts, including the motion of
microorganisms, swimming of aquatic animals,
              fluid flow around
elastic bodies, bubble motion and more.  The project
              encompasses
the development of numerical methods for flows corresponding to
              a
wide range of length scales.  The methods are based on the use of
a force
              field along filaments made of localized but smooth terms
rather than delta
              distributions.  Regular expressions for the
fluid and filament velocities
              induced by the forces are then
derived as the basis for the methods. 
              Important properties of
this approach are that it eliminates the singularities
              that would
normally be present if the forces are assumed to be
              delta
distributions, the volume of fluid within elastic boundaries
              is
conserved extremely well, and high accuracy can be achieved.  The
work is
              aimed at extending well-known numerical techniques to
three-dimensional flows
              driven by forces along filaments and to
the full range of length scales. 
              Analysis of the methods is
carried out to establish and improve their
              stability, convergence
and accuracy properties.  The applications that are
              pursued
include a wide variety of flagellar motions, the motion of
flexible
              membranes around obstacles, and others.
     The motion of microorganisms in a
              liquid and the flow of
blood in capillaries are two examples of phenomena that
              can be
studied with computational methods.  Computer techniques that
              can
accurately simulate motions of this type are very valuable
because they
              can be used to determine how arteries become
obstructed or how flagellated
              organisms perform specific
functions in the human body and the effects of
              defects in this
mechanism.  From a mathematical point of view, these
              computer
simulations are not ready for scientists to use; there is a need
to
              improve the accuracy with which the underlying equations are
being solved and
              increase the reliability of the methods.  This
project is aimed at developing
              computational methods for fluid
flows interacting with elastic structures. 
              The goal is to develop
high-accuracy methods, improve on their mathematical
              properties,
and apply them to problems from biological sciences.
