Abstract    :
              Professor William Simpson of the University of Alaska is funded by the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry and Atmospheric Chemistry programs to perform
              experimental laboratory and field studies using the ultrasensitive method,
              cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS).  This CAREER proposal seeks to combine
              instrument development aspects with educational aspects, with the goal of
              introducing sensitive methods for atmospheric field study of the Alaskan
              troposphere.  Oxidation by nitrates, profiles of methane using near-IR CRDS and
              photochemistry of organic nitrates are the topics of interest.  The PI has a
              joint appointment at the Geophysical Institute and the Chemistry Department at
              the University of Alaska.   

Instrument development for ultrasensitive
              atmospheric measurements is needed as our understanding of the atmosphere is
              refined.  This information is required for accurate modeling and prediction of
              global climate changes.  Methods such as cavity ring down spectroscopy,
              developed within the physical chemistry program, should be exploited to the
              maximum extent possible for these applications.   However, further work is
              needed to understand the limits of these methods in terms of spectral
              congestion, interferences, etc.   Professor Simpson's educational efforts
              include outreach to Native American students in the Fairbanks area.  His
              education plan incorporates the development of visual exercises for physical
              chemistry laboratory classes.
