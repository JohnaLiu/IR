Abstract    :
              With this CAREER award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
              the work of Dr. Marcey waters in the Department of Chemistry at the University
              of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.   The work consists of a series of studies to
              better understand the role of pi-pi stacking interactions in macromolecular
              recognition in both DNA and proteins.   She will measure the rate constants of
              rotation around biaryl bonds using NMR line-width analysis, and will also use
              NMR NOESY measurements to determine the extent of beta-sheet formation and
              assess pi-pi stacking interactions in a two stranded beta-peptide.  These
              systems will probe the roles of electronic effects, solvent, surface area, and
              heteroatoms in the aromatic rings.

The research and  teaching goals of this
              proposal are to understand biological structure and reactivity through physical
              organic chemistry studies, particularly using nuclear magnetic resonance
              methods.   The relationship between biological systems and nonbiological
              organic molecules will be emphasized at both graduate and undergraduate levels,
              including experiments in sophomore organic chemistry laboratory.
