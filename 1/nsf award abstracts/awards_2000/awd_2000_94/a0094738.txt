Abstract    :
              This project is increasing educational opportunities for low-income,
              academically talented students by providing scholarships and academic and
              student support services for full-time students in associate's degree programs
              in computer science, engineering, and mathematics. Support services include
              mentoring, advisement, peer tutoring, a required one-week summer orientation
              and career-identification experience, and informal learning opportunities.
              Objectives are the recruitment, enrollment, and graduation, transfer or work
              placement of increased numbers of students, particularly underrepresented
              groups in science and engineering. Progress is guided by a six-member Advisory
              Board including a financial aid officer and student services counselor, two
              representatives of local business, industry or government partners of the
              targeted programs, a coordinator or department head from one of the targeted
              programs, and the project director. A nine-member Scholarship Board awards 40
              scholarships per year in accordance with financial, cognitive, and
              non-cognitive guidelines for the selection process.
