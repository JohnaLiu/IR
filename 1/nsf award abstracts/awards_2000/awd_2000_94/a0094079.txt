Abstract    :
              Dr. Robert P. Houser, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of
              Oklahoma, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic
              Chemistry program, Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, through
              a Career Award for his work on the synthesis and characterization of functional
              model complexes of metalloprotein active sites using an array of novel ligands
              that combine the utility of traditional multidentate ligands with biologically
              relevant amino acids. Attention will be focused on modeling (i) the copper
              containing nitrite reductase, (ii) the mononuclear non-heme iron enzyme
              isopenicillin N synthase, and (iii) the unusual four-copper cluster Cu(z)
              active site from nitrous oxide reductase. In the educational front, the focus
              has a three-pronged approach: (a) improve student learning, (b) develop a
              graduate course in bioinorganic chemistry, and (c) provide a research
              environment and research opportunities for undergraduate chemistry majors and
              gifted high school students.

These fundamental studies will provide insight
              into the metal-ligand interactions that influence enzymatic catalysis. Students
              will be trained in the exciting interdisciplinary field of bioinorganic
              chemistry.
