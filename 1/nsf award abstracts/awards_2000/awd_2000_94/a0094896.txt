Abstract    :
              This project seeks to increase the number of students, especially minority
              students, graduating with degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from New
              Mexico Highlands University. The program provides 10 scholarships the first
              year, and 20 scholarships the second year to junior and senior students.
              Student-based tutoring and mentoring services are offered from graduate
              students, upper division students, and the local student chapter of the ACM.
              Other support structures include faculty workshops, and presentations from
              alumni about career opportunities in computer science and mathematics.
