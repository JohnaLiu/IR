Abstract    :
              C. David Sherrill of Georgia Tech is supported by a CAREER grant from the
              Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop electronic structure
              algorithms that will be applicable to diradical-forming reactions such as
              Bergman and Diels-Alder reactions.  These new methods will allow study of the
              competition between concerted and stepwise mechanisms in prototype organic
              reactions.  As part of his education plan, Sherrill will enhance the
              presentation of quantum mechanics in various courses through diverse learning
              environments, emphasizing visual and interactive components as well as
              web-based resources.

Despite the enormous success of electronic structure
              theory in providing accurate structures and molecular properties for large
              molecules, many crucial areas of chemistry remain beyond the reach of these
              methods.  In particular, the theoretical description of bond-breaking processes
              remains a challenge, and this research program will address this inadequacy.
              Although quantum mechanics is often considered esoteric and difficult, its
              growing importance in areas such as molecular-scale materials design and
              electronic devices requires that this subject be made more readily accessible
              to students.
