Abstract    :
              This project provides 44 scholarships to outstanding and underrepresented
              undergraduate students of Computer Science, Engineering Technology, and
              Mathematics, as well as graduate students of Computer Science and Mathematics.
              In addition to providing scholarships that enables students to successfully
              attain degrees, the project also provides and requires of each recipient of an
              NSF Scholarship group research experiences that enables them to be more
              successful as students and after graduation. Scholars are required to work 10
              hours per week on a research project; work with a project faculty member, who
              serves as the student's mentor, for a semester research assignment; attend a
              bi- weekly research colloquium; present at least one progress report per
              semester at a bi- monthly colloquium to other scholars and mentors; and submit
              a written report at the end of each semester of funding. Additionally, these
              students are encouraged to present papers or posters at regional and/ or
              national conferences. The University also commits to finding a technically
              related job on campus for every undergraduate NSF Scholar who wants a job
              during his/ her senior year. The Department commits to placing every graduate
              student in the program in either a graduate assistantship or funded research
              assistant position until completion of degree.
