Abstract    :
              This project provides 40 scholarships to academically talented low-income
              students in computer science, engineering and mathematics. These students
              attend University of Central Oklahoma (lead fiscal agent), East Central
              University, Oklahoma City Community College, or Southwestern Oklahoma State
              University. The partner institutions provide faculty mentoring, research and
              design opportunities, and interaction with industry to encourage students into
              the CSEM fields. The main objectives of this project are to increase
              participation and retention of academically talented, low-income students and
              underrepresented groups in computer science, engineering and mathematics and to
              improve the student's educational experiences. The project also seeks to
              increase the student's awareness of employment opportunities and to increase
              successful transitions from high school to community college and from community
              college to four-year institutions.
