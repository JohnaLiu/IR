Abstract    :
              This project provides 40 students with a scholarship sufficient to cover
              tuition, fees, and books, and a comprehensive set of academic support services
              to ensure that each recipient attains a 4-year degree and is prepared for
              graduate studies and/or placement in an appropriate workplace. These academic
              support services include: admission and matriculation assistance, workshops,
              access to a study center, advisement and counseling, tutoring, support in
              joining and participating in professional organizations, eligibility to compete
              for additional grant funds reserved for engineering, computer science, and math
              students, support in securing appropriate internships and summer employment,
              professional activities, job placement assistance, and involvement in a social
              support network. A comprehensive summative evaluation is planned.
