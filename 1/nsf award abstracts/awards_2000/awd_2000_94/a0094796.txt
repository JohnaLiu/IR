Abstract    :
              This workshop explores opportunities and directions for increased interaction
              between the geospatial and mainstream information technology (IT) research and
              development communities. Its goal is to illuminate directions for future
              research that would enhance the accessibility and usability of geospatial
              information and explore how geospatial applications can influence IT design and
              research. Topics include research and development areas and associated
              development/implementation issues, including trends in the enabling information
              technology, the nature and roles of the potential information contributors
              (information providers and validators), system builders, and users. The
              workshop report will synthesize the ideas and viewpoints expressed at the
              workshop, supplemented as necessary by additional material developed by the
              committee, including findings and recommendations on opportunities for
              collaboration between the geospatial and information technology disciplines as
              well as other research, development, and implementation issues, and may make
              suggestions for appropriate follow-on activities that would examine these
              issues in more depth. The report will be widely disseminated and available
              on-line.
