Abstract    :
              This proposal is to support  two workshops on the important topic of Secure
              Campus Infrastructures.  Security in general and secure campus systems in
              particular is a topic that has been discussed for years.  It is now becoming
              critical to information flow into, across,  and out of the campus network
              infrastructure that some consensus be reached on some security solutions and a
              basic implementation strategy be defined and executed.  The goal of the
              workshop will be to combine information dissemination with design and practice
              collaboration to meet the following objectives:  (1)  To facilitate
              communication between schools at the forefront of implementing these new
              technologies with those schools in the beginning or planning stages, (2) To
              engage in dialogue leading to a consensus of an initial set of best practices
              and policies in the design and development of authentication and authorization
              services, and (3) To facilitate communication with content providers of core
              and complementary academic and research resources to ensure interoperability
              and usage of leading resources and applications.
