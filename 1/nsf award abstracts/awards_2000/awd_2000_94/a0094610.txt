Abstract    :
              This project provides educational opportunities to low income, academically
              talented students through scholarships that promote full- time enrollment and
              degree achievement in computer science, engineering, and mathematics. The
              project includes an established priority ranking that focuses on funding for
              Native Americans and other under- represented populations. The recruiting plan
              includes using well-established organizations such as the American Indian
              Science and Engineering Society (AISES) and the Society for the Advancement of
              Chicanos and Native American (SACNAS). Scholarship recipients' academic
              progress is monitored and information on mentoring and career opportunities is
              provided. Students are required to establish a degree plan and monitor progress
              within that plan. The overall goal of the project is to implement a scholarship
              program where 40 scholarship recipients receive an associate or baccalaureate
              degree in one of the project's disciplines or transfers from an associate to a
              baccalaureate degree program. The project also includes a mentoring plan.
              Through this project, 40 students from across the United States will have the
              opportunity to participate in a program encouraging them to pursue associate
              and baccalaureate level degrees in computer science, computer technology,
              engineering, engineering technology, or mathematics.
