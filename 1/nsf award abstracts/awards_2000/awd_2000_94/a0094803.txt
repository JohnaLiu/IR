Abstract    :
              This program provides extensive support to students in an effort to
              significantly increase the number of low- income students earning degrees in
              computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, and
              mathematics by providing scholarships to talented but financially disadvantaged
              students. The project has four major objectives: 1) increasing the number of
              low- income, academically talented students studying computer science,
              engineering, and mathematics at the associate degree level; 2) improving the
              rate of academic success for students in these fields of study; 3) facilitating
              transfer of CSEMS graduates to employment or the baccalaureate level; and 4)
              strengthened partnerships between educational institutions and related
              employment sectors. These objectives are met by providing students with a
              comprehensive network of support services including tutoring in the Learning
              Achievement Center; academic, personal and career counseling in the Counseling
              and Advisement Centers; and Student Success Seminars. In addition, CSEMS
              scholars participate in The Pre- College Summer Institute and Enrichment
              Seminars to strengthen math and science skills, to study special topics in the
              CSEMS disciplines, and to develop the mindset necessary to study computer
              science, engineering, or mathematics.
