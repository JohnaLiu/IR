Abstract    :
              This award supports a career development plan that will integrate  research
              programs that produce and use state-of -the-art astronomical instrumentation
              with University of North Carolina's (UNC) mission to train graduate and
              undergraduate students in observational astronomy.  The main educational
              objective is to develop, over a 5 year period, a set of pedagogical hardware
              and software tools that will allow students in observational astronomy to
              deepen their understanding through direct experimentation with working
              instrumentation and reduction software.  The second objective is to fund
              graduate and undergraduate student participation in ongoing research programs
              that involve producing new and innovative astronomical
              instrumentation.

Funds provided in this award will also support ongoing
              research programs that involve innovative instrumentation.  These include
              seismological studies of white dwarf stars and investigations of the
              mass-radius relation on the lower main sequence.  The former will make use of
              the state-of-the-art spectrograph under construction at UNC and the second will
              employ an automated telescope and camera already built and deployed.  Both of
              these projects involve graduate students in the development of astronomical
              instrumentation.
