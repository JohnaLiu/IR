The proposed work will integrate a new direct detection
              imaging spectrometer (SPIFI = South Pole Imaging Fabry-Perot Interferometer)
              into an existing telescope at South Pole station, in order to study the
              physical conditions, dynamics, and composition of the interstellar medium and
              its relationship to star formation in galaxies.   SPIFI is designed for use in
              the far-infrared and sub-millimeter windows available to the 1.7 m Antarctic
              Submillimeter Telescope and Remote Observatory (AST/RO) at the South Pole; it
              has been tested in similar windows at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope on
              Mauna Kea in Hawaii. SPIFI's detector is a 5 x 5 element array of monolithic
              silicon bolometers cooled to 0.06 deg K in an adiabatic demagnetization
              refrigerator.  The current version of the instrument can be tuned to any
              frequency in the 350 micron window, and continuously scan 13 spectral
              resolution elements at any given wavelength.  SPIFI will be used to study the
              excitation conditions of molecular, photodissociated, and ionized interstellar
              matter in the so-called central molecular zone of the galaxy; the physical
              condition of interstellar matter in nearby galaxies, and the low metalicity
              environment of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds to see whether these mimic
              protogalaxies - a key to understanding the star formation process in the early
              universe.
