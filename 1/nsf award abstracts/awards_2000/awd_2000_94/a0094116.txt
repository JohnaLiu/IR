Abstract    :
              Anna Krylov of the University of Southern California is supported by a CAREER
              grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop
              electronic structure methods for excited states to treat spin-orbit coupling,
              non-adiabatic coupling, and spin-forbidden relaxation.  Applications include
              halomethyl radicals and singlet diradicals.  As part of her educational plan,
              Krylov will employ in her courses multimedia demonstrations, problem-solving
              software, and mini-research problems using a new computer lab specifically
              designed for the integration of teaching and research.

Accurate theoretical
              modeling of electronically excited molecules is a current challenge, and is
              needed for a detailed understanding of chemical processes such as those found
              in the environment and in materials synthesis.  This research program is
              directly related to a teaching program at the undergraduate and graduate
              levels, which includes innovative uses of computer-based learning systems.
