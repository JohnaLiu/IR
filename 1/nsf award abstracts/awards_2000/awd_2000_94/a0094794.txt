Abstract    :
              Increased demands for skilled labor in the fields of computer science,
              engineering, and mathematics (CSEM) have heightened the need for community
              college participation in the recruitment and education of such majors. As a
              nation that is growing more and more dependent on technology degrees, the need
              to recruit and train nontraditional students such as minorities and women is
              critical. The primary objective of this project is to provide scholarships to
              help increase the number of academically talented but financially disadvantaged
              persons, particularly Hispanics and women, enrolling full- time in CSEM
              associate degree programs and completing their degrees as preparation for CSEM
              careers and further higher education. The project uses a combination of
              expanded scholarship opportunities, a rigorous recruitment plan, mentor-
              designed workshops on student success, student pairing- up ("buddy system"),
              industry involvement, and a student support structure delivering services such
              as advising and tutoring to create growth in the programs, help students
              complete their studies within two years, decrease the attrition point for
              students between the first and second years, and have the scholarship awardees
              either transfer to a four- year institution or enter the workplace. A
              distinctive feature of this "bridging the gap" program is the partnership
              between the NSF student awardees and community. "Colonia" development agencies
              are helping to develop a link between the colonias and the NSF students so that
              both colonia residents and the students (sometimes colonia residents
              themselves) benefit from tutoring and learning opportunities. Further, NSF
              students have direct contact with employers, allowing them to see how their
              learned skills work in the community.
