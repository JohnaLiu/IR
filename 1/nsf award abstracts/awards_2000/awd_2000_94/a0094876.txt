Abstract    :
              This project is to establish a scholarship program for low- income, academically
              talented students enrolled fulltime in one of the degree programs offered by
              the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Mathematics and
              Statistics. There are forty awards per year. Students may apply for a second
              year of funding. The selection process includes indicators of academic merit
              and likely professional success. Support structures, which are already in place
              at the college assist in recruiting, placement, and retention of scholarship
              recipients. Several options are available to the students who receive a
              scholarship: a research project mentored by a senior faculty member,
              participation in already established college projects, and internships in New
              York City programs for academic assistance to high school students. A goal of
              the project is to attract academically sound students to the computer science
              and mathematics majors at the college.
