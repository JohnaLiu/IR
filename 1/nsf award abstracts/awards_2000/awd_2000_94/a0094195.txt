Abstract    :
              The Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the Chemistry Division support
              this CAREER award to Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.  In this
              project, Professor Daniel Dyer of the Department of Chemistry will study the
              formation of noncentrosymmetric organic thin films from self-assembling
              monolayers formed by hydrogen bonding.  These self assembled liquid crystal
              polymers with acceptor and donor groups at the opposite ends may have
              applications in electrooptic devices.  The second part of the research will be
              the deposition of oriented dipole polymer brushes on gold or glass surfaces by
              free radical or anionic polymerization to provide polar stability and
              processability to thin films. The long-range goals of this research are to
              study structure-function relationships, to determine binding interactions and
              to control the self-assembly in organic thin films.  The educational component
              of this program involves the development of a new course work in materials
              chemistry at graduate and undergraduate levels with summer internships in
              industrial laboratories. 

This research will impact the fields of
              polymer-based nonlinear optics, piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity, and the
              development of thermodynamically stable thin films for electrooptic devices of
              commercial interest. The educational component of the award with industrial
              partnership will provide interdisciplinary education and industrial training
              opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students.
