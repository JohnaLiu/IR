Abstract    :
              These scholarships support low- income students who are majoring in math,
              computer science, or any engineering discipline. The overarching goal of the
              program is to help low- income students in the targeted disciplines to
              successfully complete a stage within the degree program which is documented as
              a point of unusually high attrition at the Unviersity of Rochester. The program
              aggressively supports and retains low-income students within the first and
              second years, leading up to the declaration of the major during the second
              semester of sophomore year. The Program seeks at least a 50% participation rate
              for women and members of minority groups. 
Unique learning communities of
              small groups of first and second year students are established in each of the
              targeted disciplines. Each learning community is guided by a graduate student,
              and meets weekly for study, enrichment activities, and group- building events.
              The full group of scholarship recipients meets on a monthly basis with members
              of the Steering Committee. Each student recieves intensive support services
              aimed at keeping the student in the major.
