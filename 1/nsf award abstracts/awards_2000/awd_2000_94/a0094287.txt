Abstract    :
              This CAREER award to Professor Samuel Gilman of the University of Tennessee in
              Knoxville is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the
              Chemistry Division.  The primary focus of this research is the use of capillary
              electrophoresis for the study of aggregated proteins.  Both laser light
              scattering and fluorescence detection will be utilized.  There is a substantial
              scientific and biomedical interest in the fundamental aspects of protein
              self-assembly and aggregation.  A model system of amyloid proteins will be
              studied.  The educational component involves the creative use of animated
              tutorials (created by senior students) for the education of junior students. 
              These internet and CD based tutorials will be widely disseminated and will
              enhance student education.

Protein aggregation and self-assembly are known
              to occur during normal and disease state biological functions.  Abnormal
              protein aggregation is implicated in aging and in neurological disorders.  The
              research includes components of instrument design and fundamental chemical
              studies on separations of compounds with biomedical relevance.
