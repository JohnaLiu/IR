              Chiba abstract

An organism's ability to flexibly adapt its behavior based on
              the learned associations of environmental stimuli can be critical to the
              survival of that organism.  Among other issues, successful adaptation relies on
              both appropriate modulation of attention and an accurate appraisal or
              evaluation of the affective significance of environmental stimuli.  Two
              distinct anatomical divisions of the amygdala, the central nucleus and the
              basolateral complex, are thought to play a role in adaptive behavior under many
              experimental conditions that depend on associative learning.  Numerous
              subcortical and cortical anatomical projections allow the amygdala access to
              basic sensory and somatic information, and also position it to affect the
              output of behavior.  The proposed body of work is aimed towards the
              investigation of the role of the central nucleus and the basolateral complex of
              the amygdala and their constituent corticopetal/cortical systems in modulating
              attention and affective evaluation during learning.  A combination of
              behavioral tasks, neural recording (single units) neurochemical manipulations,
              and lesion techniques will be used to gather data investigating these issues. 
              Once the data are gathered, techniques for alternative analysis of the neural
              firing properties will be pursued in a collaborative effort with computational
              modelers.

Additionally, this research program will be used as a vehicle to
              provide research opportunities for students at multiple academic levels (high
              school through post-doctoral).  A critical component of this approach will
              include training researchers to do science while providing them with the skills
              and opportunities to teach others.  Ultimately, this will result in a community
              outreach effort aimed towards providing unique scientific opportunities and
              information that may serve to draw a more diverse group of young people to the
              sciences.
