Abstract    :
              This program provides financial and academic support for talented low-income
              students in computer science and mathematics. The recruitment and retention of
              under- represented minorities and women is a priority with an expectation of
              doubling the graduation rates for these students. These students participate in
              scholarship activities including monthly meetings; conversations with other
              students, graduates, faculty and representatives from industry; mentoring;
              internships; and research with faculty. The student support structures are
              constructed specifically to meet the needs of students at the university and to
              assist them in finishing their education, choosing a career, and obtaining
              successful employment or placement in graduate school.
