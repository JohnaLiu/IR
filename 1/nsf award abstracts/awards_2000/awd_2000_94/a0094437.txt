Abstract    :
              Eastern Kentucky University primarily attracts students from central, eastern,
              and southern Kentucky. Many of these students (about 40% qualify for Pell
              Grant) have financial problems, which forces them to try to work full time and
              go to school full time. This affects the retention rate, graduation rate, and
              also affects the major that they pick. The number of mathematics and
              mathematics teaching majors has been very low now for many years. As a result
              of this there is a shortage of secondary teachers of mathematics in the state
              of Kentucky and especially in this region. The forty scholarships are helping
              to solve many of the problems in attracting, retaining, and graduating
              academically talented students in computer science and mathematical sciences.
              Outcomes of the project will be an increase in enrollment, graduation rate, and
              quality of the programs.
