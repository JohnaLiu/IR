Abstract    :
              This project is increasing the enrollment, retention and graduation rates in
              associate degree programs in computer science, engineering technology, and
              mathematics (CSEM) for low- income, academically talented students,
              particularly those from underrepresented populations. The project consists of
              three major components: (a) recruitment of students into CSEM programs, in
              partnership with school districts and community agencies, with an emphasis on
              populations that are typically underrepresented in CSEM fields; (b) academic
              support, through existing programs and targeted initiatives, to assist CSEM
              students in persevering and succeeding in their chosen academic programs and
              careers; and (c) provision of scholarship assistance to enable high ability,
              low- income students to pursue full- time studies in CSEM associate degree
              programs. These objectives are being accomplished through a network of existing
              programs, services and resources, as well as through the addition of new
              academic support initiatives. New initiatives include expanded partnerships
              with area schools, business and industry and agencies serving underrepresented
              populations to assist in recruitment of non- traditional students; the creation
              of a "student ambassador corps" to assist in recruitment of high school
              students; provision of targeted supplementary peer tutoring for students in
              barrier courses; peer mentoring by senior CSEM students for students enrolled
              in developmental courses; and provision of up to 40 scholarships per year for
              high- ability, low- income CSEMS students. The CSEM scholarship project is
              being implemented under the aegis of the New Jersey Center for Advanced
              Technological Education (NJCATE).
