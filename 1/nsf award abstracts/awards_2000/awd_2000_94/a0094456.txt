Abstract    :
              In recent decades many new diseases have emerged. In some cases existing disease
              organisms jumped to novel hosts with sometimes devastating effects. In 1994 a
              new strain of Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), a bacterium common in poultry,
              appeared and spread very rapidly through the house finches of eastern North
              America. This caused  house finches to decline within 2-3 years by 100-200
              million birds, stabilizing at 40% of pre-disease levels. The researchers will
              continue to monitor MG prevalence and house finch abundance across the entire
              continent, involving large numbers of volunteers; carry out intensive fieldwork
              to gather information about the ecology and behavior of both infected and
              non-infected house finches; and perform controlled aviary experiments to
              measure the rate of transmission of MG among house finches. Emphasis will be
              placed on identifying human-related factors that modify the spread and
              maintenance of the disease.  

This information will be used to develop and
              validate general predictive models that can be applied to similar systems.
              Understanding which factors are responsible for the emergence of new diseases,
              which factors favor for their spread, and how they affect their hosts is
              essential to the control of new diseases.
