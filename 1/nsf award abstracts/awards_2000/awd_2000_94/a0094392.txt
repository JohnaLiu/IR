Abstract    :
              This RUI award to Professor Alice Deckert of Allegheny College entitled
              "Investigation of the Kinetics and Mechanism for Covalent Binding of Proteins
              to Thin Films" is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program. 
              The goal of the research is the comprehensive study of the kinetics and
              mechanism of protein binding to thin films.  Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
              and microgravimetric (Quartz Crystal Microbalance) analyses will be used to
              help understand these reactions.  The research will focus on improving the
              development of biosensors.  Both Langmuir-Blodgett protein thin films and
              self-assembled monolayers will be examined.  The research is interdisciplinary
              and will impact the fields of surface analysis, analytical chemistry and
              biochemistry.

This research, to be performed by undergraduates, will be
              scientifically significant and educationally rich.  The results will impact
              society in furthering the development of biosensor technology.
