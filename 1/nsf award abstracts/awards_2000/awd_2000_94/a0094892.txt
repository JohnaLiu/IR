Abstract    :
              This project is providing students from economically disadvantaged areas with
              the financial assistance necessary to participate in a comprehensive
              educational program in Engineering Technology. The Computer Science,
              Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships (CSEMS) program allows eligible
              students to advance their knowledge of engineering and science, earn an
              Associate degree or Bachelor degree in Engineering Technology, enhance their
              career marketability, and prepare to enter the region's engineering technology
              workforce. The mission of the college is to deliver through traditional and
              innovative programs an education that prepares students to prosper in their
              chosen professions and thrive in a society characterized by diversity and
              change. The CSEMS program provides an educational opportunity to students who
              would otherwise not consider higher education or need a higher degree to
              maintain job security.
