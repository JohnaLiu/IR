Abstract    :
              With this award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the
              work of Drs. Richard M. Pagni and Robert N. Compton of the Department of
              Chemistry at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.  The work has two
              objectives: 1) producing high enantiomeric purity organic compounds in solution
              using multiphoton photochemistry with circularly polarized light, and 2)
              producing chiral crystals by carrying out crystallizations in the presence of
              electrons or positrons.

Making chiral (left or right handed) molecules and
              crystals with high purity is becoming increasingly important in a number of
              areas, including pharmaceuticals and advanced materials.   The PIs have
              proposed some novel ways to do this using circularly polarized light, or
              particles (electrons or positrons) with opposite spins.   While the work is
              high risk, it could potentially have a large impact, including shedding light
              on the origins of chirality in biological molecules like aminoacids.
