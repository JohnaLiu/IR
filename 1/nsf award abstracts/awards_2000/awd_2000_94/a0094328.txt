Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical particle physics will include work on
              superstring
theory, and quantum field theory. Techniques which do not
              require
approximations will primarily be used to explore the structure of
              both
superstring theory and quantum field theory: particularly through the
              use
of symmetry, and via the interplay between superstring theory and
              quantum
field theory. Quantum field theory is the conventional framework
              for
describing elementary particles and their interactions. On the other
              hand,
superstring theory is the exciting candidate for a quantum theory
              of
gravity, which also provides a unified framework for all the
              fundamental
forces. Understanding the complete structure of superstring theory
              is of
central importance in our attempt to answer basic questions about the
              nature
of space-time and gravity.
