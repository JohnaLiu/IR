Abstract    :
              This program provides scholarships annually for two years to low-income
              undergraduates in computer science, computer technology, engineering, and
              engineering technology majors. The primary goal of the program is to increase
              the number of talented but financially disadvantaged residents of the region
              who achieve higher education degrees in computer science, computer technology,
              and engineering. This project focuses on the recruitment and retention of these
              students to degree achievement. The primary objectives include increased
              participation and retention of academically talented, low income students and
              underrepresented groups; increased grade point averages of students; enhanced
              professional development opportunities for students; and improved placement of
              participating students in baccalaureate transfer programs and related
              employment. The scholars participate in a wide range of retention-related
              activities utilizing an exemplary student services program. Scholars also have
              an opportunity to participate in an engineering and information technology
              summer institute which includes field trips to engineering and information
              technology industries in the region and to four- year schools with whom the
              institution has an articulation agreements in engineering and information
              technology majors. This project serves as a model for other community colleges
              in areas where high unemployment has forced entire regions to change their
              economic base.
