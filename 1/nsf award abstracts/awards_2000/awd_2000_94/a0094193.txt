Abstract    :
              This award will create a publicly accessible database of tree ring-based
              chronologies from the Himalayas and the Indian subcontinent regions that will
              help reconstruct climate over the past few centuries.  It will also fund
              expeditions to India and Bhutan to further expand the tree-ring network and
              provide support to statistically analyze new tree ring data from these field
              expeditions.  Such data from this climatically sensitive region is critical for
              understanding global climate variability on annual to century timescales.  In
              the process of building a database of unique climate information, the research
              effort will also build collaborations with international colleagues working in
              this previously inaccessible region through cooperative research and the
              organization of an international workshop to share scientific data and ideas.
