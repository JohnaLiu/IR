Abstract    :
              This project provides funds for computer science, engineering, and mathematics
              majors. It includes collaboration between a university and community college to
              recruit talented community college students to complete technical degrees at
              the four year institution. This program provides scholarships to increase the
              number of talented, but financially disadvantaged students, graduating and
              entering the workforce in the defined technology areas. The project provides
              professional development programs to facilitate experiential learning through
              industrial internships, academic progress monitoring and mentoring programs for
              students. These are established ongoing programs. This scholarship program aims
              to increase educational opportunities for qualified students, improve retention
              to degree by removing financial barriers, and provide improved student
              professional development.
