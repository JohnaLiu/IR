Abstract    :
              This project is implementating the Technology Scholarship Program which provides
              scholarships to 30, full- time pell- eligible, computer and engineering
              technology students, each year, based on academic merit and demonstration of
              professionalism. The project is designed to increase retention, full- time
              enrollment, graduation among the students enrolled in these programs, and
              employment after graduation. The recruitment of project participants includes
              both enrolled and prospective engineering and computer technology students. The
              project includes a detailed plan for recruiting and selecting students who
              demonstrate academic merit and professionalism. Participants receive assistance
              from the Project Team in completing their degree, academic success, and upon
              graduation, obtaining a job in their field.
