Abstract    :
              This project provides scholarships for low income, academically talented
              students, including twenty- five (25) undergraduate students majoring in
              Mathematics, Computer Science or Information Technology (MTH/ CSC/ IT) and
              fifteen (15) graduate students enrolled in the Master of Science in Computer
              Information Science Program (M. S. CIS). The twenty- five (25) undergraduate
              recipients include ten (10) new students transferring into La Salle's MTH/ CSC
              Department as juniors from community colleges or from the University's unique
              associate degree program for Latino students (the BUSCA Program) and fifteen
              (15) returning MTH/ CSC/ IT majors who are entering their junior years at the
              University. The fifteen (15) M. S. CIS students include six (6) new students
              entering the program and nine (9) students already enrolled as Master's degree
              candidates. At least 30% of the funded students are women, and at least 10% are
              minorities. In addition to scholarship assistance for the student recipients,
              funds are also used for project management, for tutorial assistance for the
              undergraduate CSMES recipients, and for a special Career Exploration series of
              guest speakers who are employed in professional positions in Mathematics,
              Computer Science and/ or Information Technology.
