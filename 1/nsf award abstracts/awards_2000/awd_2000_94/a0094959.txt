Abstract    :
              Bats can be reservoirs for viruses that transmit to humans. As urban sprawl
              replaces natural colony sites with building roosts, the potential for public
              contact with bats as possible disease vectors increases. Rabies is the foremost
              example, but there is little credible information on rabies in bats from public
              health agency records. Less is known about rabies infection in free-flying
              urban bat populations, or on factors that affect transmission among individual
              bats and colonies.  The project will develop empirical models of the influence
              of bat population dynamics and movements on rabies transmission rates.  The
              study will emphasize sampling and recapture of marked big brown bats in Fort
              Collins, Colorado, a rapidly sprawling area. Bats will be sampled for rabies
              virus and antibodies, and other factors that may influence disease transmission
              will be determined using information-theoretic methods.  Buildings with roosts
              will be characterized, and movements among buildings modeled using Geographic
              Information Systems.

This work will improve understanding of the ecology of
              disease transmission in bats and provide a unique molecular-based
              characterization of rabies virus dynamics. The study will provide a more
              sophisticated and predictive evaluation of the transmission and spread of
              bat-borne diseases
in growing urban areas.
