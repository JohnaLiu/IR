Abstract    :
              This scholarship and support program is designed to increase the number of
              women, especially women of color, who graduate with baccalaureate degrees in
              computer science and mathematics. A secondary focus of the program is to help
              meet the need for college-educated workers with technological capabilities in
              Wisconsin. The program provides 35 scholarships each year to junior and senior
              students majoring in computer science or mathematics. During each student's
              junior and senior years, a comprehensive array of support programs on the
              campus are available on an as-needed basis and, when necessary, are tailored to
              her needs. Mechanisms already in place on the campus for referral to services
              and a campus culture which supports collaboration help ensure student success.
