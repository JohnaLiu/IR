Abstract    :
              This project offers scholarships to full-time students majoring in Computer
              Science, Information Systems, Engineering Technology, Engineering, and
              Mathematics. The goals of the program include increasing the number of women
              and minorities in these fields, shortening the length of time required to
              complete the program by increasing the number of full-time students, and
              providing experiences with professionals in the field. In order to be eligible
              for a scholarship, students must be academically talented and demonstrate
              financial need as defined by the U.S. Department of Education Pell Grant. Each
              student receiving a scholarship is assigned a mentor and is required to shadow
              a professional in their major field each semester. Scholarships are
              automatically renewed for a second semester provided that eligibility
              requirements are maintained.
