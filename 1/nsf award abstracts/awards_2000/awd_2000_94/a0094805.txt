Abstract    :
              Building upon the achievements of the current academic support infrastructure,
              Drexel University is implementing a comprehensive Computer Science,
              Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships (CSEMS) program to increase the
              recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of economically disadvantaged and
              historically underrepresented students. The program serves students throughout
              the calendar year. Activities include a summer program, mentoring, a career
              awareness center, corporate and college partnerships, counseling, corporate
              alumni advising, faculty involvement, and undergraduate research. Students
              maintain continuous contact with CSEMS staff who provide academic advising,
              career counseling, and graduate school exploration workshops. Specifically,
              this project is preparing engineering, computer science, and mathematics
              undergraduates for successful careers in technical professions.
