The village of Chevak, Alaska, is home to
              a community of Cup'ik Eskimos who still practice a subsistence-based economy.
              The inhabitants of Chevak are connected to three archaeological village sites
              that have been sequentially occupied by many of the present members and direct
              ancestors of Chevak residents. Preliminary archaelological and oral historic
              data have indicated changes between the sites in general settlement pattern and
              location, specifically the loss of the men's house and intra-site tunnels, and
              changes in storage facility size and distribution. It is hypothesized that the
              shifting patterns reflect socail and economic transitions as a result of
              European contact. This dissertation research will use both archaeological and
              ethnographic methods to document and explain settlement pattern variation at
              the three village sites.
