Abstract    :
              The university is operating a CSEMS scholarship program for students in
              aviation-related fields as well as computer science, computer engineering, and
              electrical engineering. The program involves aggressive recruitment, primarily
              at community colleges, of academically superior, low-income students; a plan to
              orient, motivate and ready the students for rigorous academic performance; a
              plan to support the students through a professor-mentor and advising program;
              and a plan to help them gain employment in their degree fields, or be accepted
              in graduate school.

The university is using its contacts with a number of
              aerospace and electronics firms, which afford special opportunities for its
              students for summer research, co-operative assignments, and new graduate
              hiring. In addition, the university has made a substantial financial commitment
              to the NSF program, agreeing to augment the NSF funds with major institutional
              scholarships, offering material leverage to NSF funding
