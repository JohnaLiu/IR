This CAREER program effort is a long-term study of
              estuarine fronts in San Francisco Bay.  Over a series of years, during the
              summer months, moored ADCPs will be deployed in regions where fronts of
              different type are known to exist.  Short, one-day experiments will be
              performed using shipboard mapping, microstructure profiling, and dye studies of
              dispersion in and around the fronts. The dominant question to be asked is 'to
              what extent do fronts influence mixing and transport in estuaries'?  Fronts
              limit mixing and cross-frontal transport, they encourage along-front transport,
              and they may enhance mixing during frontolysis.  The proposed work will
              identify the relative importance of these processes.  The educational component
              will include development of a display and visual experiments at the San
              Francisco Exploratorium and development of field opportunities for graduate
              students interested in environmental fluid dynamics.
