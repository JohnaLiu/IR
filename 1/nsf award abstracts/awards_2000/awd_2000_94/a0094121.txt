Abstract    :
              Professor Lisa A. Holland of Kent State University is funded by the Analytical
              and Surface Chemistry CAREER program to study phospholipid bicelles as
              immobilized partitioning media for electrokinetic capillary chromotography. 
              The work involves the characterization of the bicelle media in detail as a
              function of temperature, mixed micelle ratios, concentration and composition. 
              Then the sieving capabilities of this material will be optimized for separation
              of polypeptides, proteins and DNA.  The ability of bicelle solutions to
              incorporate receptor systems based on biotin-avidin chemistry will be utilized.
               

The educational component of this work focuses on the use of distance
              learning to initiate a research program in separations at Haskell Indian
              Nations University.  The interest is in screening traditional tribal medicines
              for receptor affinity.
