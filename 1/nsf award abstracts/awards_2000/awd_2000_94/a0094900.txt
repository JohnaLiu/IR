Abstract    :
              This program awards scholarships to economically disadvantaged students, with a
              special emphasis on students from underrepresented groups in engineering and
              science. Recruitment targets three groups: 1) incoming freshmen, 2) incoming
              transfer students, and 3) continuing students at the junior level. This group
              includes students from majors in Berkeley's College of Engineering, chemical
              engineering majors in the College of Chemistry, and students in the computer
              science or mathematics majors in the College of Letters and Science.
 Scholars
              participate in a variety of retention- related activities tied to the existing
              student support infrastructure of CUES, the EECS Center for Undergraduate
              Matters and other partner programs. This includes faculty advising, academic
              excellence workshops, tutoring, mentoring, advising, internships in industry
              and/ or research experience, and assistance with graduate school applications
              or job placement.
