Abstract    :
              This project is supported under the Faculty Early Career Development Program
              (CAREER). For the research component, two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x
              GC) will be developed as a tool for characterizing the volatile organic
              composition of the atmosphere. The technique will be compared side-by-side with
              the GC/MS method (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry). In addition,
              laboratory and field studies will be performed to determine the significance of
              n-aldehydes in the troposphere. The PI will in particular investigate the
              hypothesis that the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in natural waters,
              such as lakes and river, is a major source of these compounds.

The education
              part of this project will include the involvement of graduate and undergraduate
              students in this research, the development of an atmospheric chemistry course,
              and outreach activities for local high school teachers.
