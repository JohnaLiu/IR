Abstract    :
              This program supports 45 scholarships for upper division students in computer
              science and mathematics and graduate (M.S.) students in mathematics. Priority
              is given to students traditionally underrepresented in the computer science and
              mathematics fields such as women, ethnic minorities, and persons with
              disabilities. Enriched experiences for these students include activities such
              as faculty mentoring, peer mentoring, honors program, industry internships, and
              research experiences.
