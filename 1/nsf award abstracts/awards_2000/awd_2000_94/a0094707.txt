Abstract    :
              This workshop proposal was not reviewed externally, but is considered to fall
              under the provisions of the NSF Proposal and Award Manual Section 122.3b. The
              award is for NSF co-sponsorship of a three-day conference focused on assessing
              the magnitude of the digital divide in thirteen southern states and on
              ameliorating the gap in access and computer literacy among southern
              populations. About 450 researchers, policy makers, community and business
              leaders and interested citizens are expected to attend. NSF sponsorship will
              enable the research and production of the report associated with the conference
              and it will provide some stipends for the speakers.
