Abstract    :
              Dr. Sarajedini will carry out a study of the stellar populations of galaxies in
              the local neighborhood of the Milky Way out to about 5 Mpc, with the aim of
              understanding the star formation and chemical evolutionary histories of
              galaxies with a range of morphological types.  Particular attention will be
              paid to the interplay of dynamical interactions, star formation, and chemical
              enrichment in these galaxies.  Work in a number of research areas will provide
              observational data to study the effects of environment on galaxy formation and
              evolution.  His research plan includes studies of clusters in the galaxy and
              nearby Magellanic Clouds to develop a grid of color-magnitude diagrams that
              cover a range of metallicity and age.  These will be used as fiducials against
              which the stellar populations of dwarf galaxies can be determined.  He will
              also investigate the effects of dynamical interactions on star formation by
              studying the local examples of the Sagittarius dwarf and the Magellanic Clouds.
               He also plans to compare and contrast the stellar populations in the Milky
              Way, M33, and M31 using a variety of data.  As larger and more efficient
              telescopes become available, these techniques and types of observations will be
              extended further into and beyond the local group.  

He will also carry out a
              suite of educational and outreach activities over the next 5 years, which range
              from outreach to local K-12 classrooms and public talks for the Gainesville
              area, to designing a new undergraduate course.  His research program naturally
              includes opportunity for undergraduates and graduate students to be highly
              involved and significant contributors.
