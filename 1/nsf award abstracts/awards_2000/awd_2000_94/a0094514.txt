Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the graduate level because of a severe projected
              shortage of workers in the next decade who can fill positions of high
              complexity in the technology sector, such as scientists and system analysts. It
              is especially important because there is a dearth of U.S. nationals in the
              graduate pipeline to fill these high-end technology workforce needs. Recruiting
              and retention activities emphasize the value of a graduate degree, with the
              help of representatives in industry. Individual monitoring and coordination
              with faculty ensures that recipients feel integrated with the department and
              are satisfied with their progress.
