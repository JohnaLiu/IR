Abstract    :
              The Technology Tomorrow Scholarship Program is designed to attract more students
              to two- year technical programs in the computer science, computer technology
              and engineering technologies. The project focuses on low-income, first time
              students who are not necessarily college directed or oriented but who have the
              talent to succeed in technical programs based in computer science, computer
              technology or engineering technologies. The project provides the opportunity
              for financial assistance to students in the West Texas Region, an area marked
              by vast distances between metropolitan areas and a large percentage of
              economically disadvantaged students. The program combines scholarship
              assistance with student services, including a specialized mentoring program,
              designed to promote success in college, success in job placement, and success
              in the workplace.
