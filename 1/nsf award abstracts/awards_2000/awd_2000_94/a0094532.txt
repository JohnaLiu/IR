Abstract    :
              This project will build a comprehensive model to simulate interactions between
              energy, water, and carbon dioxide using data collected from tundra regions in
              northern Alaska.  The model will be used to examine the role of global climate
              change on terrestrial ecosystems in an area that is predicted to be the first
              to feel the greatest effects of global warming.  The project will utilize
              satellite images and data, data collected from recent field programs, and
              output from other models of the individual environmental components.  The
              project will develop a regional simulation of climate impacts on terrestrial
              ecosystems and address the questions of energy and water balance in the Arctic
              system.  The research will identify critical gaps in the understanding of
              climate-sensitive variables in the Arctic terrestrial ecosystem as well as the
              exchange of carbon dioxide with the atmosphere.  Therefore, the project will be
              an important contribution to understanding the biocomplexity of the environment
              in an area undergoing rapid climate change at present.
