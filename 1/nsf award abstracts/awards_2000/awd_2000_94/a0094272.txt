Abstract    :
              This project will determine role of the subsurface chlorophyll maximum as a site
              of alkenone export production in an oligotrophic subtropical ocean environment.
               Analyses of sediment trap time series samples and water samples will be used
              to determine seasonal production of alkenones and the depth at which they are
              produced.
