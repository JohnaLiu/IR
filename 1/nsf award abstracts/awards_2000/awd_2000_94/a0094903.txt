Abstract    :
              This project provides scholarships to talented low-income students to complete
              degrees in computer science, computer or electrical engineering, or
              mathematics. A learning community and seminar course help to support
              scholarship recipients in their academic and career prepartion. Specific goals
              are to link the scholars with each other and with other students, faculty and
              business leaders. The focus of the program is on low-income women and minority
              students, qualified transfer students from community and state colleges, and
              underemployed students whose education has been interrupoted by the need to
              work. The program seeks to achieve an 100% placement rate for graduates
              entering appropriate positions in the workplace or advanced education.
