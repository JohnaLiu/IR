Abstract    :
              The Computer Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Scholarship
              Program is providing scholarship support to talented students who demonstrate
              financial need to encourage and enable academic achievement and to increase the
              number of graduates in areas of national need. This program provides
              scholarships to junior and senior level undergraduates pursuing degrees in
              computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering physics,
              engineering technology, and mathematics. The program has a structure for
              supporting, developing, and retaining minority and women students in these
              degree areas toward increasing the number graduating for the high- tech
              industrial workforce or for continuation for advanced degrees. Much of the
              student- support infrastructure necessary for the successful graduation of
              scholars comes from existing programs at North Carolina A& T State University.
              The new NSF- funded TALENT- 21 Project at the University provides some of the
              student- support infrastructure for scholars, and the TALENT- 21 Project goals
              and objectives are inclusive of those of the NSF CSEMS Program.
