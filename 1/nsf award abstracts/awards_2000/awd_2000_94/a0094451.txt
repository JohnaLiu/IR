Abstract    :
              The National Science Foundation Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics
              (CSEMS) project is providing scholarships for low income, academically talented
              students, enabling them to pursue degrees in computer science, computer
              technology, engineering, engineering technology, and mathematics. There are two
              complementary aims of the program. The two- year degree program prepares
              students to make the transition to a four- year degree program. In addition,
              associate and certificate programs provide opportunities, not only for pursuing
              additional degrees, but also for workforce placement in an area with high
              unemployment but strong occupational demand for people with the training and
              education in these technical areas. Recruitment, retention, matriculation,
              graduation, and continuing education/ placement are the focus of students
              participating in the program. Well-established academic support and mentoring
              programs strongly embedded in the management philosophy and college vision
              provide strong retention support to assure that students complete the programs.
              The program has four goals: improved education for all students in the stated
              disciplines, increased retention to degree achievement, improved professional
              development and employment for participating students, and strengthened
              partnerships between institutions of higher education and related employment
              sectors.
