Abstract    :
              The project entitled "Advancing Diversity and Excellence in Mathematics and
              Computer Science" enhances existing retention and graduation programs in
              mathematics and replicates these successful activities in the program in
              computer science. The goal is to increase the percentage of ethnic minorities
              and women who enroll in the two target disciplines at California State
              University, Dominguez Hills, and who graduate in a timely manner with a
              Bachelor's degree. The focus is on junior transfer students who enter these two
              majors and on the overall number of female who select one of these majors. In
              addition to the scholarship assistance provided by the grant, the project
              institutes a program of mentoring by faculty and staff and a series of
              presentations by individuals representing the local industries that hire many
              of the institution's graduates. A center for computer science majors is
              developed; this is based on a model that has enjoyed success in the mathematics
              program. On- campus employment in various labs and tutoring centers is arranged
              for those students interested in gaining additional practical experience, and
              the program rewards and recognizes excellence in its students by placing as
              many as possible in summer research experiences. The ultimate goal of the
              project is the training and entry into the workforce of individuals who for
              reasons of poverty, cultural background, or gender might not otherwise enter or
              complete programs in the fields of mathematics and computer science.
