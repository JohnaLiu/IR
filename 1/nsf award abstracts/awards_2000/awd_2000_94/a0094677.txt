Abstract    :
               This program provides scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students in
              mathematical and computer sciences. Targeted undergraduate students are in
              their final two years of baccalaureate studies, and graduate students are in M.
              S. degree programs in the two disciplines. Scholarship recipients are mentored
              one-on-one by faculty and by peers from both departments. They participate in
              ongoing research projects, professional forums, and industry-related
              activities. Their progress in their chosen curricula is monitored closely and a
              wide range of campus resources are available to ensure that they successfully
              finish their degrees within the project's two-year time frame.
