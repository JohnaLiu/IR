Abstract    :
              The fundamental objective of this project is enabling talented but financially
              disadvantaged students pursuing careers in computer science, mathematics and
              engineering (CSEM) to achieve higher education degrees. Our objectives include
              1) increasing the number of math, engineering, and computer science
              scholarships available to individuals who are underrepresented in these fields;
              2) increasing the awareness of the variety of job opportunities available for
              advanced degree graduates; 3) facilitating a mentoring relationship between the
              scholar and a person already working in their chosen field; and 4) encouraging
              scholars to gain leadership experience by acting as peer mentors. The primary
              participants are 40 CSEMS students each year for two years who receive
              scholarships based on financial need and academic excellence. Targeted
              recruiting efforts as well as a myriad of student support services and advanced
              pedagogical practices including clubs and organizations, application oriented
              experiences for students, a project-based Capstone course, and internship/field
              experiences, and an active-learning curriculum result in improved recruitment
              and retention rates of CSEMS student. A strong Tech Prep partnership program
              allows student to enter this program in the 11th grade and transition
              seamlessly to the associates degree program. Students are encouraged to
              transfer to 4-year institutions to complete a bachelor degree in their chosen
              discipline.
