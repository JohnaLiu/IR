Abstract    :
              The scientific component of this CAREER activity focuses on experiments and
              theoretical approaches that explore the importance of noise and randomness in
              two biological systems:  (i) the actin propulsion engine and (ii) stochastic
              gene expression in bacteria.   The goal of the first project is to unravel the
              biophysical mechanism of force generation and self-organization of polymerizing
              actin filaments.  Theoretical efforts will focus on developing realistic models
              that incorporate the recent biochemical data of actin propulsion engines.  In a
              synergistic manner, experiments will be performed that explore the propulsion
              of well-defined cargo such as polystyrene beads, phospholipid vesicles, and
              micro-fabricated cylinders.   The main goal of the second project is to
              quantitatively understand stochastic gene expression in prokaryotic cells. 
              Using analytical and numerical tools, stochastic expression will be modeled
              theoretically.  The theories will be tested by exploring stochastic gene
              expression of single genes and simple genetic networks in prokaryotic cells
              using fluorescent reporter proteins.   The educational component of the
              activity focuses on the development of an infrastructure for biophysics at MIT
              thorough a number of different mechanisms, including a new seminar series, new
              courses, and journal clubs.  This award is jointly supported by the Division of
              Physics in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the

              Biological Sciences.
