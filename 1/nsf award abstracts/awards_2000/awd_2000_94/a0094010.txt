Abstract    :
              The PI's proposed activities involve the creation of new algorithms and software
              for simulating the interactions of large biological molecules. The algorithms
              will overcome the difficulties associated with the wide range of length and
              time scales inherent in such systems. The resulting software will have
              different levels of sophistication and computational intensity, ranging from
              serious scientific research to simple illustrations suitable for high school
              students. It will be useful for researchers trying to understand biomolecular
              interactions at the atomic level and to predict rates and equilibria of
              interactions. It also will be useful for high school, undergraduate, and
              graduate students seeking to understand these interactions.

In order to
              bring the fruits of the research into the classroom, a user-friendly interface
              will be developed for the software mentioned above. This will allow students to
              choose diverse biological molecules and experiment with interactions among
              them. The educational activities will also proceed along three fronts -
              graduate, undergraduate, and high school. In the near future, the PI will
              develop a graduate-level course, which will explore the molecular basis for
              transport and thermodynamic phenomena in biological systems.
