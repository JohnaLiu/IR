Abstract    :
              
Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on
              the
extremely early universe, including the implications of fundamental
              physics
and superstring theory for cosmology, and the role of cosmology as a
              testing
ground for new ideas. Superstring theory is a way to unify all
              forces,
including gravity and electromagnetism, and an understanding of
              its
cosmological implications is crucial to extending our knowledge of
              the
earliest times in the universe. This research will investigate how
              specific
models of new physics account for the evolution of the universe, and
              how we
may read their fingerprints on the sky today. Cosmology has proven to
              be an
important way to experimentally probe particle physics, and the
              discovery of
a signal of new physics in cosmological data would fundamentally
              change our
understanding of the universe.
