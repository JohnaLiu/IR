Abstract    :
              This project provides 40 scholarships to increase the recruitment, retention,
              and graduation rates of economically disadvantaged and historically
              underrepresented students in Computer science, Engineering and Mathematics.
              Activities include a summer program, mentoring, a career awareness center,
              corporate and college partnerships, counseling, corporate alumni advising,
              faculty involvement, and undergraduate research. Scholars maintain continuous
              contact with faculty and staff who provide academic advising, career
              counseling, and graduate school exploration workshops. The project aims to
              prepare engineering, computer science, and mathematics undergraduates for
              successful careers in technical professions.
