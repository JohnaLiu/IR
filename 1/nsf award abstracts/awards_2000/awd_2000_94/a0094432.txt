Abstract    :
              This project provides 40 scholarships for financially disadvantaged students in
              the areas of computer science, mathematics and engineering technology.
              Recruitment efforts feature a special focus on underrepresented minorities and
              women. Student support activities are leveraged with funding from several other
              federal programs, providing scholars with outstanding academic and social
              opportunities that include peer tutoring, a colloquium series, and summer
              research. There are ample opportunities for scholars to participate in
              meaningful internships and excellent prospects for professional employment in
              the indicated disciplines. A special emphasis is placed on urban science which
              relates directly to the environment of the institution.
