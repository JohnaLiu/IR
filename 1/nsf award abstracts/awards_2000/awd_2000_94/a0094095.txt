Abstract    :
              Dr. David Goldberg, Department of Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University, is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program,
              Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, through a Career Award for
              his work on the synthesis and characterization of novel corrole macrocycles
              that will incorporate and stabilize high-valent oxidation states of transition
              metal ions such as iron(IV), nickel(III), and copper(III). Metal-oxo species
              such as (corrole)Fe=O will be isolated, characterized and exploited as possible
              catalysts for the dehalogenation of chlorocarbons. In the educational front, a
              series of Chemistry Workshops will be developed for the Ingenuity Project, an
              outreach program for advanced inner-city students focused on mathematics and
              science. Also, a new graduate level bioinorganic chemistry course will be
              implemented in which critical reading of primary literature and presentation
              skills will be emphasized.

The new corrole macrocycles will find
              applications in activating molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, and in their
              mediating reductive dehalogenation of environmentally significant organohalide
              substrates such as the recalcitrant carbon tetrachloride found in many
              groundwaters. Students involved in the Ingenuity Project will have access to
              potential role models and will help them discover the excitement of doing
              chemistry, and science in general.
