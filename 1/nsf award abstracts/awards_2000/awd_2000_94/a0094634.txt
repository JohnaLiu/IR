Dr. Bier intends to study the role of a multi-pass integral
              membrane protein known as Rhomboid (Rho) in promoting signaling via the
              Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGF-R) in the fruit fly Drosophila
              melanogaster.  The EGF-R is a member of the widely used receptor tyrosine
              kinase (RTK) family, which activates the RAS/MAP-Kinase pathway.  Rhomboid
              functions in conjunction with a single pass transmembrane protein (Star) to
              activate EGF-R signaling by a mechanism involving the production of a
              diffusible extracellular signal.  The specific goals of this project are to: 1)
              analyze the function of domains of Rho that are predicted to lie inside or
              outside of the cell, 2) examine the basis for the intimate interaction between
              Rho and Star in promoting EGF-R signaling, and 3) determine whether Rho and
              Star participate directly or indirectly in producing a diffusible EGF-like
              signal.  

Dr. Bier anticipates that this study will lead to the formulation
              of specific mechanistic models for how Rho and Star activate EGF-ligands.  More
              generally, this project should broaden our understanding of fundamental
              mechanisms for regulating the production and range of action of RTK ligands
              during development.  Since RTK signaling pathways play a central role in
              development and regulation of cellular proliferation in vertebrates and
              invertebrates alike, these insights should have general implications for
              understanding cell-cell communication, which is also highly
