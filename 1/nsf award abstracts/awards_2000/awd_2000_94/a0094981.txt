The investigator seeks to combine phenomenological and
              microscopic approaches to the problems of high temperature superconductors with
              the ambitious aim of constructing a theoretical framework capable of accounting
              for the known features of cuprate and other correlated superconductors, and of
              predicting new ones.  The new approach would incorporate essential physics of
              strong correlations obtained from microscopic approaches that are absent from
              'traditional' phenomenological approaches.  The initial focus of the work will
              be on the role of vortices in thermal and quantum fluctuations, the interaction
              of quasiparticles with vortices and their effect on critical behavior, and the
              interplay of fluctuations and correlations in the 'pseudogap' regime of high
              temperature superconductors.

This proposal involves theoretical research
              and education in condensed matter theory with a focus on high temperature
              superconductors. A new attack will be mounted on the difficult problem of
              understanding the mechanism of superconductivity and elucidating the specific
              properties of high temperature superconductors that lead to the unusual and
              potentially technologically important phenomenon of 'high temperature
              superconductivity.'  The theoretical arsenal will include a new synthesis that
              combines essential elements from microscopic theories and phenomenological
              approaches.
