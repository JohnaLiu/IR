Abstract    :
              The Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics, Scholarship Program at
              Arizona State University provides scholarships and a support infrastructure
              that enables academically talented, financially disadvantaged lower division
              students to maintain fulltime enrollment and progress toward degree completion
              into upper division status where attrition rates are reduced. Targeted fields
              include engineering, engineering technology, mathematics, computer science, and
              computer technology. The program offers a supported summer bridge program for
              recruited high school seniors (entering freshman) across the state and a
              variety of carefully designed activities to enhance learning and career
              opportunities. The program also expands and enhances the continuum of services
              available to students of diverse gender, ethnic, social, and economic
              backgrounds, clearly supporting the university's commitment to provide a high
              quality education to all students.
