Abstract    :
              This project uses the educational and research infrastructures of eight partner
              institutions as support systems for financially disadvantaged underrepresented
              minorities in the areas of computer science, engineering and mathematics. The
              program provides a mentor support system through problem- solving workshops,
              Drop- in Centers, Computer/ learning Centers and peer mentoring programs.
              Industrial and government partners provide outstanding cutting- edge research
              opportunities throughout the nation. Directed research and internships permit
              students to take part in a variety of research projects, establish mentoring
              relations with research faculty, and professionals and extend their classes
              into real- world tests.
