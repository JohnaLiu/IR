Abstract    :
              The Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program of the Division
              of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, supports the work of Dr. James N.
              Demas of the Department of Chemistry, University of Virginia, and Dr. Ben A.
              DeGraff of the Department of Chemistry, James Madison University, VA, which
              will explore fundamental and applied aspects of sensors and probes based on
              luminescent metal complexes. Specifically, new ligands, new metal complexes,
              and new polymer supports will be designed and synthesized in a rational manner
              to gain a fundamental understanding of the photophysics and photochemistry of
              the luminescent complexes, to examine the interactions between the sensor
              molecules and polymer supports, to test certain hypotheses, and to further
              enhance sensor performance.

With the results from this study, the principal
              investigators will improve and enhance sensor performance designed to test for
              changes in pH and the presence of carbon dioxide. Several undergraduate
              students will be involved in this study at both institutions, and together with
              graduate students will receive unparalleled training in syntheses, reactivity,
              characterization, photochemistry and photophysics of new luminescent materials
              and polymer supports.
