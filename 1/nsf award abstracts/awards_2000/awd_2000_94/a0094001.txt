Underdetermination, Real
              Antirealism, and a New Induction on the History of Science

Existing
              challenges to Scientific Realism [the position that our scientific theories
              should be understood as (at least approximately) true descriptions of the
              inaccessible domains of nature] have made extensive use of either the claim of
              the "Underdetermination of Theories by Evidence" (i.e. that our evidence is
              invariably insufficient to favor existing theories over alternative
              possibilities equally well confirmed by that very evidence) or of the
              "Pessimistic Induction" over the many past scientific theories that have turned
              out to be false despite exhibiting the same evidential and practical virtues
              that we might take to confirm present theories. Dr. Stanford proposes to
              challenge the framework of the existing debate and to pursue a new defense of
              Antirealism by developing the following line of argument in a series of
              connected papers forming the core of a future book.

First, Dr. Stanford
              argues that it is a mistake for existing discussions of underdetermination to
              focus almost exclusively on the existence and status of putative "empirical
              equivalents" to existing theories: popular algorithms for generating such
              equivalents simply trade in the problem of underdetermination for familiar
              philosophical chestnuts (in particular, Cartesian skepticism or the problem of
              spurious confirmation), while the few convincing examples of empirical
              equivalents simply will not support the intoxicating morals that champions of
              underdetermination have hoped to draw.  Stanford argues, however, that Realism
              is no less threatened by the prospect of empirically inequivalent hypotheses
              that are nonetheless equally well-confirmed by all the actual evidence we have
              in hand as are existing theories, so long as such a transient
              underdetermination predicament recurs for each theory and body of evidence we
              consider. Furthermore, he appeals to a New Induction on the History of Science
              to argue that this predicament of recurrent, transient underdetermination is
              our own. Rather than simply pointing to the falsity of past successful
              theories, the New Induction points out that we have, throughout the history of
              scientific inquiry and in virtually every scientific field, repeatedly occupied
              an epistemic position in which we could conceive of only one or a few theories
              that were well-confirmed by the available evidence, while subsequent inquiry
              has routinely revealed the existence of further theories just as well confirmed
              by the totality of evidence then available as were those we accepted on the
              strength of that very evidence. He defends this New Induction against potential
              objections and argue that the distinctively holist claim of underdetermination
              influential in the science studies literature is best seen as supporting a
              version of this same New Induction. Finally, Dr. Stanford defends both the New
              Induction and the original Pessimistic Induction against the recently
              influential Realist reading of the history of science which finds the true
              features or aspects of past theories to be those responsible for their success,
              arguing in reply that this match is virtually guaranteed by the fact that the
              Realist appeals to a common point of reference (our current theoretical
              beliefs) in judging both what a past successful theory got right and what
              features were responsible for its success.
