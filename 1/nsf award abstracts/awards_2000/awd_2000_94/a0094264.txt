Abstract    :
              Dr. Francois Gabbai, Department of Chemistry, Texas A&M University, is supported
              by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program of the
              Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work under a Career
              Award whose principal focus is to prepare and explore the chemistry of
              non-toxic organometallic polydentate cryptate and macrocyclic Lewis acids that
              will incorporate elements of group 13 as active sites. The educational
              objective will expose undergraduate students to a broader range of experiences
              thereby fostering personal growth by having students spend one or two semesters
              abroad through establishment of a departmental international exchange program
              with European universities.

The studies will provide insights into
              developing new catalysts of potential interest to the pharmaceutical industry,
              and will provide graduate students and post-doctoral associates with skills for
              better prospects in the job market. Undergraduate students who spend time
              abroad under the exchange program will benefit both socially and professionally
              from their experiences in a foreign institution.
