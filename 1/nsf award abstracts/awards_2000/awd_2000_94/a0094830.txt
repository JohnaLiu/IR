Abstract    :
              This project provides scholarships to talented but financially disadvantaged
              students to assist them in attaining higher education degrees in computer
              science, engineering technology and mathematics. Appropriate consideration is
              given to underrepresented minorities, transfer students, women and students
              with disabilities. Scholarships are provided to students across the four- year
              curricula in the targeted disciplines. Freshman and sophomores receive
              scholarships to help increase retention, which is a documented area of concern
              for the targeted areas. Scholarship awards are incremented to provide a
              weighted allocation to juniors and seniors. The project resources are
              incorporated within a web of complementary university programs. The project
              encompasses several activities and services to support the development of its
              scholars, which includes: recruitment, faculty and peer mentors, dedicated
              tutorial services, internships and research opportunities, preparatory summer
              workshops to support continued academic growth and grooming for career
              development and exploration.
