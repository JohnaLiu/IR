Abstract    :
              This scholarship project is a collaboration between Horry-Georgetown and York
              Technical Colleges. Both institutions have nationally recognized, advanced
              computer and engineering technology curricula and have a specific need to
              assist academically prepared students to complete their two- year degree in the
              prescribed time. All of the participating programs are academically strenuous
              and require a full summer semester between the freshman and sophomore years.
              Through the implementation of the Computer Science, Engineering, and
              Mathematics Scholarship (CSEMS) program, the colleges are identifying up to
              forty students of academic merit who are at risk of not completing their degree
              requirements due to financial need, and to support and insure their graduation.
              The goals of the project include increasing the retention rate of students
              enrolled in the programs, improving the higher education placement rate of
              participating students, and strengthening partnerships between the colleges and
              the area industries who employ the graduates. This project is extending a
              one-year award from the prior year.
