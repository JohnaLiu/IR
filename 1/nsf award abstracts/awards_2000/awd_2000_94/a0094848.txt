Abstract    :
              The Scholarships for Women and Minorities in Engineering Technologies (SWMET)
              program is providing financial, academic and social support for thirty
              low-income, academically talented women and minorities seeking associate
              degrees in Engineering Technologies (ET). Each student is receiving a
              scholarship and participating in activities such as mentor relationships, co-op
              experiences, interview skills workshops, and a SWMET Scholars Club. The program
              is also developing a dynamic web page that is not only a storehouse for
              information; but also a clearinghouse for necessary program communications for
              students, faculty, and administrators involved in the program. The SWMET Club
              uses graduates of the SWMET Club to serve as mentors immediately upon
              graduation. These mentors, who have entered the workforce, represent their new
              employers, serving to strengthen relationships with area businesses. Area
              business and industry representatives are also serving in an advisory capacity.
