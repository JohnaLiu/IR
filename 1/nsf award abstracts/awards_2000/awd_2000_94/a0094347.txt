Abstract    :
              This award entails a comprehensive program for the synthesis of novel core-shell
              hybrid nanoparticle materials (HNM) containing (HNM) a polymer shell and an
              inorganic core and the development of two materials applications.  The polymer
              shell of the nanoparticles can be created with exquisite control in
              functionalities, composition, thickness, and uniformity using Ring-Opening
              Metathesis Polymerization (ROMP) chemistry.  The inorganic core can be made
              from either metals, semiconductors, or insulators, and can be either magnetic
              or nonmagnetic.  The resulting nanoparticle composites can then be formed to
              possess the best combination of physical properties that can be utilized in a
              variety of diagnostic, deliveries, and sensing applications.

The proposed
              research will allow the Northwestern researchers to synthesize core-shell
              hybrid nanoparticles materials and elucidate their fundamental behaviors.  This
              knowledge can then be used to tailor these materials for device-based
              applications in electronic- and health-related fields.  Examples of potential
              applications include:  thin-film radiation detectors, ultrasensitive
              redox-amplified DNA detection, and targeted delivery of polymer-based
              anticancer drugs.  A comprehensive approach to education, which includes not
              only graduated and undergraduate, but also K-12 and community outreach, is an
              integral part of this award.
