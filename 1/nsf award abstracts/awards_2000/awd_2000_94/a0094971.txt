Abstract    :
              The project will investigate the dynamical interactions and tracer transports
              between the tropics and midlatitudes, especially during Northern winter. The
              equatorial upper troposphere is occupied by a belt of easterlies during much of
              the year, except winter, when westerly winds are present over the
              central/eastern oceans. The easterlies are an effective barrier for equatorward
              propagating stationary Rossby waves, and the wintertime "westerly duct" thus
              presents an opening that allows vigorous tropical-extratropical interaction.
              Dr. Waugh will conduct a dynamically oriented analysis of meteorological fields
              and water vapor observations to understand how tropical-extratropical
              interactions through this conduit impact tropical convection, and the upper
              tropospheric distribution of water vapor (a major component in global warming),
              ozone, and trace gases. These trace substances exert a profound control on the
              earth's climate, directly through radiative impacts, and indirectly, through
              the altered balanced circulation. Dr. Waugh will use a range of dynamical and
              transport models to provide context for his observational findings.
