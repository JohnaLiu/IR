Abstract    :
              Professor Joseph Pesek of San Jose State University is sponsored by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program via a RUI grant for research on
              fabrication, characterization and applications of new separation media.  The
              research will lead to the development of new substrates for HPLC, capillary
              electrophoresis (CE), capillary electrochromatography (CEC), and solid phase
              microextraction (SPME) for the purpose of improved separations.  The first part
              of the work focuses on chemical modification of silica and other oxide surfaces
              with organic moieties, especially alkynes.  Chemical modification will also be
              achieved with liquid crystal compounds.   The second part focuses on etching
              processes for the purpose of increased surface area, and subsequent application
              of these materials to open tube CEC separations (OTCEC) and SPME
              configurations.  OTCEC will be developed for improved separation of proteins,
              peptides and pharmaceuticals.

The ability to separate biological compounds
              is of great importance in medical research and genomics, as well as in chemical
              and pharmaceutical industry.  Exposure to this work will enable San Jose
              students (many of whom are from under-represented groups) to enter technical
              positions in these areas of national need.
