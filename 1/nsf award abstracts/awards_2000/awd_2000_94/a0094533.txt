Abstract    :
              This project provides a vibrant Pathways to the Baccalaureate Scholarship
              Program with a focus on increasing equity and access through our recruitment
              and retention efforts, the development of relationships with on- and off-campus
              constituents, and specified program goals. The program targets students in
              their junior and senior years in computer science, computer information
              systems, computer engineering technology, civil engineering technology,
              electrical engineering technology, mechanical engineering technology,
              industrial engineering technology, and applied mathematics. The primary program
              goals include the provision of an enriched learning environment for students,
              assisting students with exploration and preparation for entry into Pathways-
              targeted professions and graduate school, and the creation of structured career
              development and planning experiences that can be utilized by students
              throughout their entire careers.
