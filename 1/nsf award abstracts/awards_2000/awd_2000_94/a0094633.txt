Abstract    :
              This project provides 20 scholarships per year for two years to computer science
              students in the junior and senior year. A strong mentoring program is a key
              element for the scholarship students, with both faculty and student mentoring.
              Senior level students who are second year scholarship recipients will be
              selected as mentors. Scholarship recipients are required to participate in at
              least one cooperative education experience, or to undertake a research project
              under faculty supervision. Native Americans and Hispanics are a target
              population for this program.
