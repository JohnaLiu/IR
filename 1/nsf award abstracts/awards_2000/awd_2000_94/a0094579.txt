Abstract    :
              This research award to Professor James Reilly of Indiana University -
              Bloomington, entitled "Characterizing the Reactions of Surface-bound Biological
              Molecules by Mass Spectrometry"  is supported by the Analytical and Surface
              Chemistry Program.  The goal of the research is to explore the fundamental
              chemistry of protein binding to surfaces.  The surface interactions will be
              probed using mass spectrometry.  In particular the following problems will be
              examined: 1) the cause of reduced chemical activity of bound enzymes compared
              to free enzymes 2) structural changes which affect the location and number of
              binding sites in bound proteins 3) the effect of the surface structure on the
              enzyme activity.  The research has the potential for high impact in the areas
              of surface and interfacial science as well as for mass spectrometry and
              biochemistry.

This research is creative but high risk.  It will provide the
              opportunities for students to work on an interdisciplinary project involving
              analytical chemistry and protein biochemistry.  The outcome of this research
              could impact the fields of biotechnology, protein diagnostics, protein
              structure and modeling and immunoassay techniques.
