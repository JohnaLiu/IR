Abstract    :
              The proposed research will investigate stereoselective cycloadditions of chiral
              allenamides and ynamides.  Applications of chiral allenamides to the total
              synthesis of natural products in the castanospermine family and of chiral
              ynamides to the natural products, the perhydrohistrionicotoxins, will be
              explored.  The educational component of this plan will introduce a group
              concept into the undergraduate organic chemistry lab course.   Students will be
              divided into teams where each student makes one structural analog of a common
              synthetic sequence of 3-4 steps.

With this CAREER award, the Organic
              Synthesis Program is supporting the research of Professor Richard P. Hsung of
              the Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. 
              Professor Hsung's research will explore the chemistry of new types of organic
              molecules, the allenamides and ynamides, as building blocks to form more
              complex cyclic compounds.  These studies are relevant to the synthesis of
              pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals.  The teaching plan will introduce a
              team concept into the undergraduate organic chemistry lab course, wherein teams
              of students will synthesize several structurally similar compounds using
              similar sequences of synthetic reactions.
