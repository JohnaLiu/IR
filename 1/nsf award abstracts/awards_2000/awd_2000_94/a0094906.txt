Abstract    :
              We are promoting the achievement of baccalaureate degrees in computer science,
              computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, and mathematics by
              academically talented but financially disadvantaged students by: 1) Providing
              financial aid to low income, academically talented students through 40
              scholarships annually over a two- year period 2) Improving education in these
              disciplines by creating supportive environments for these students through
              changes in organizational culture and practices 3) Increasing retention of
              students to degree achievement by encouraging preparation for information
              technology careers through student development initiatives 4) Improving
              professional development and employment of students by providing enriched
              research experiences, mentoring, and support in employment placement 5)
              Strengthening university- industry partnerships through collaborative
              implementation.
