              AST-0094335


Dr. Yun Wang will carry out a program of research and education
              that focuses on studies in cosmology.  Her research plan is centered on
              exploring the use of two independent cosmological data sets, the type Ia
              supernovae (SNe Ia) and the cosmic microwave background anisotropy (CMB) to
              provide model-independent constraints on fundamental physical parameters.   SNe
              Ia provide us with a unique probe into the unknown energy content of the
              universe, the dark energy.  Using innovative techniques, Dr. Wang will study
              the constraints they provide on the equation of state of the dark energy, as an
              arbitrary function of time, from current and future SN Ia surveys.  CMB data
              allow us to probe the physics in the very early universe.  Dr. Wang will
              improve and expand on her previous work on the determination of the spectrum of
              the primordial matter density fluctuations, parameterized as an arbitrary
              function of wavelength.  Using new analytical methods and numerical tools, she
              will analyze current and future CMB observations that will provide
              observational guidance for constructing the correct inflationary model to
              describe physics in the early universe. 

Dr. Wang will take advantage of the
              unique opportunities at the University of Oklahoma in integrating her research
              into educational activities.  She will involve undergraduates in research by
              presenting a series on cosmology at the honors college, designed to attract
              outstanding students to the field at an early age, by engaging students from
              the honors college and other universities in research through the University's
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates program, and by including undergraduate
              students in her research team.  She will also develop a cosmology course for
              graduate and upper level undergraduate students, and will offer public lectures
              in cosmology to the local community.
