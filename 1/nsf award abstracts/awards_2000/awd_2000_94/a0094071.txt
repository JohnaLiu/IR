Abstract    :
              The Brockport Mathematics, Computer Science and Computational Science ( BMACS )
              Scholarship Program consists of a comprehensive plan that includes high quality
              educational programs, and a strong plan to manage and administer the program
              using the talents of highly skilled faculty members assisted by industry-
              related Advisory Boards. The program has the full backing of a committed
              administration and the support of a strong student infrastructure that enhances
              existing campus programs ( such as the McNair and CSTEP programs) without
              supplanting them. This program aims to significantly increase the number of
              talented, but economically disadvantaged students in the three majors who can
              successfully complete a degree in a timely manner and go on to employment in
              their field or graduate school.
