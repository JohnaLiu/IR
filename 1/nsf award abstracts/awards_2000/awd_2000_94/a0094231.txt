Abstract    :
              Dr. Chaboyer will carry out a program of research and education that focuses on
              studies of stellar evolution through the development and distribution of
              improved stellar models and isochrones.  His research plan involves two broadly
              defined areas.  First, he plans to construct improved stellar models and
              isochrones for stellar systems with ages greater than 1 Gyr.  These models will
              incorporate advances in our understanding of rotation, mixing, and convection. 
               He will apply and test these models using a combination of helio- and
              astro-seismology, abundances of the light elements lithium, beryllium and
              boron, and luminosity functions of globular clusters.  In a second area of
              research, he will apply these models to arrive at new estimates of ages for the
              oldest globular clusters, investigating the effects of the uncertainties in the
              distance scale and the models themselves, and carrying out a detailed Monte
              Carlo study of the errors involved.   He will bring much of this research
              activity to students and the public by developing computer animated videos and
              web-based access to the stellar structure calculations and will use these tools
              to develop introductory astronomy labs.
