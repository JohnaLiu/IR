Abstract    :
              Very few academic intervention programs for women in science and engineering
              have foucsed on graduate students and junior faculty.  Yet, attrition rates for
              women doctoral students are significantly higher than those for men and numbers
              of female faculty in SMET areas remain very low.  Research indicates that women
              increasingly want to pursue academic careers in science and engineering, but
              experience prolbmes in these fields due to institutional factors such as
              gendered organization patterns and overt subtle discrininatory
              preactices.

We propose to organize a primarily regional conference of
              Mid-western land-grant colleges and universities on the Iowa State University
              campus to bring together women's studies facutly and others doing research on
              women in SMET fields, and faculty and graduate students in science and
              engineering, in order to exchange relevant research findings on the barriers to
              graduate and faculty women's full participation in science and engineering
              fields and to develop strategies and action plans aimed at retaining women
              graduate students and facutly in science and engineering.

A unique aspect of
              the proposed conference is that it aims to bring together scientists and
              women's studies scholars-two groups that seldom interact and yet have a great
              deal to learn from each other-in terms of 5-7 persons from about 20 academic
              institutions.  These teams will be exposed to the current research on women ins
              SMET fields, exchange information, and work collaboratively to develop ideas
              for potential retention programs at theri universities.  Each team will be
              expected to construct a plan of action for its own institution, to implement it
              in the successive months, and to report on it ata a follow up forum a year
              later.  The proceedings of the conference and follow up activity will be
              disseminated on the web and in print.
