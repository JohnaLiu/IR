KORF

WGBH is at the initial stages of developing
              TeachingTeachers.org.  This project will utilize WGBH's extensive broadcast,
              video and interactive programming resources to support teacher education and
              student learning in science at the K-12 grade levels.  As currently conceived,
              the result will be a searchable, Web-based repository of no-cost, high-quality
              materials that teachers can easily access for their own professional
              development as well as to support classroom activities with students.  They are
              seeking immediate support to study the viability, usefulness, and functionality
              of the proposed model. 

The Principal investigator reports that they  have
              made significant progress in developing the concept over the past year.  With
              NSF support they will be able to complete the design of a prototype, test its
              component parts with target users, and explore options to keep the resources
              free of commercial agendas.
