Abstract    :
              This project provides scholarships to fulltime undergraduate and graduate
              financially disadvantaged students who are talented in mathematics and computer
              science. The program also provides strong support for these students with the
              following objectives: (1) to increase academic achievement, ensure retention,
              and reduce the time to obtain a degree; (2) to provide forums and other
              opportunities in which practitioners, theoreticians, students and faculty will
              interact; and (3) to prepare scholars for graduate study and careers in
              academia, business, and government agencies. Specific activities in support of
              these objectives include providing students with technical and tutorial
              support, conducting colloquia which present current research, and providing
              internships for scholars in banks, hospitals, industries, and "high- tech"
              companies.
