Abstract    :
              Professor Robert Walker of the University of Maryland College Park is supported
              by the Experimental Physical Chemistry CAREER program to perform experiments
              using nonlinear optical probes of the solid/liquid boundary. Questions of
              structures of solvents near solid surfaces will be examined systematically
              through the use of solvent dependent shifts in chromophore absorption spectra. 
              Complementing the equilibrium measurements will be ultrafast time-resolved
              studies of the mobility of molecules next to surfaces.  The results could have
              impact in many fields such as catalysis, geochemistry and biology.

A pilot
              program will be implemented to introduce motivated first year students to
              independent research opportunities in physical and analytical chemistry.
