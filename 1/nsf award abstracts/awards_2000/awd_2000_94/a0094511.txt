Abstract    :
              The Appalachian College Association (ACA), a consortium of 33 private liberal
              arts colleges in central Appalachia, was formed to maximize the efforts of
              these colleges by facilitating their ability to share resources. Central
              Appalachia needs computer scientists, engineers and mathematicians, but most of
              the colleges graduate only a small number of students in these areas. This
              projects provides forty scholarships a year for two years to qualified third or
              fourth year students from the Appalachian area attending one of 31 ACA schools.
              Awarding these scholarships through the ACA office allows small schools to take
              advantage of the National Science Foundation initiative even if they have only
              one or two students interested in these programs and allows the schools to
              provide a support structure for the students that may not be available on an
              individual campus. Scholarship recipients are invited to the fall meeting of
              ACA Academic Deans. Here they have the opportunity to interact with fellow
              students and to meet graduate school deans and industry leaders. The presence
              of the scholarships encourages more students to consider majoring in these
              areas and the support structure provided for the recipients supports their
              success in their academic programs while in college, and success in jobs or
              further education.
