Abstract    :
              The Computer Science and Telecommunications Board of the National Academy of
              Sciences proposes to explore the intersection of computer science and biology
              in order to find new interdisciplinary opportunities  and new directions for
              expanding information technology research. New emphasis areas for resrach
              program planning by NSF, DARPA and NIH will also be developed.   Using
              workshops and minisymposia, the Board will produce a report, reviewed through
              the National Research Council process, that will be distributed through a
              variety of mechanisms and media.  The dissemination process will by initiated
              by a public briefing on the report.
