Abstract    :
              This program provides both financial and academic support to low-income students
              with special consideration given to new transfer, female, and under-
              represented minority students. Primary objectives of this program are to 1)
              increase the number of low-income students obtaining undergraduate degrees in
              computer science, engineering and mathematics; 2) increase the number of women
              and under-represented minorities obtaining undergraduate degrees in computer
              science, engineering and mathematics; and, 3) to increase retention and
              graduation in these fields. In addition to financial assistance, CSEM
              recipients participate in a variety of activities designed to support their
              success including faculty mentoring, academic advising, faculty research or
              internship experiences, and enrollment in a special seminar focused on career
              and graduate schools information.
