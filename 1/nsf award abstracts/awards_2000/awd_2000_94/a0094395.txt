Abstract    :
              In this project, Mitchell investigates two cases of biological complexity:
              social insect societies and ecological systems. She argues that a new
              perspective on the relationship among scientific theories is needed to replace
              both reductionism and isolationism. Integrative pluralism is a view that
              acknowledges the partial autonomy of the scientific study of different levels
              of organization and analysis, but nevertheless supports integration in the
              generation of explanations of concrete, complex phenomena. In the two case
              studies Mitchell aims to detect patterns of integrative strategies used in
              contemporary biology and to further articulate an analytic framework for
              understanding the complex relations in which the variety of theories and
              explanations stand.
