Abstract    :
              This research award to Professor Troy Wood of SUNY-Buffalo entitled "Durable
              Emitters for Nanoelectrospray Mass Spectrometry" is supported by the Analytical
              and Surface Chemistry Program.  The goal of the research is the development of
              new technology for interfacing capillary electrophoresis (CE) with mass
              spectrometry (MS) through the fabrication of an improved interface.  The
              emitters developed will be more durable than those currently available and they
              will be coated with a conducting polymer to enhance their operation. 
              Additionally, the  conducting polymer surface will be characterized using a
              variety of techniques such as FTIR, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and
              scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  The surface characterization results will
              be correlated with emitter performance.

This research is significant because
              mass spectrometry provides a highly sensitive method of detection for
              biomolecules and CE provides the high specificity separation needed to deal
              with the molecular complexity found in biological samples.   The research will
              also support undergraduate students from Puerto Rico, which will greatly
              enhance the education of minority students.    The proof-of-principle will be
              shown through three collaborative projects which have significant, real-world
              applications.
