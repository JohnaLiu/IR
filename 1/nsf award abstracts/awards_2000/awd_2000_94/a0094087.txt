Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at Fort Valley State College  will acquire
              a stopped-flow UV-VIS spectrophotometer.  Research will focus on the following
              studies: a) the biological interaction of gold colloidal particles in
              antibody-antigen reactions; b) stability of laboratory peptide-DNA hybrids; and
              c) the photodegradation of organic water pollutants by visible irradiation of
              photosensitizing catalysts.  .  

Absorption spectroscopy using ultraviolet
              or visible light (UV-VIS) is one of the most standard methods in modern
              chemistry for quantitative and qualitative analysis.  These studies will have
              an impact in a variety of areas including environmental sciences and
              biochemistry.
