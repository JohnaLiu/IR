Abstract    :
              The University is operating an NSF Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics
              Scholarships (CSEMS) program to support 80 students for the academic years
              2001/ 02 and 2002/ 03. The CSEMS program supports a cohort of beginning first
              year students and beginning community college transfer third year students for
              each academic year in one of the designated majors: computer science, computer
              technology, engineering, engineering technology or mathematics. First year
              students are primarily recruited from high schools in the southeast Texas
              region and the Houston Independent School District. The third year transfer
              students are recruited primarily from the Houston Community College System. The
              community college transfer students are required to have completed the
              associate degree in science, mathematics, engineering or technology (SMET).
              Under the CSEMS Program students are awarded the scholarships from the NSF
              grant during their first academic year at the University. Through the Honors
              Program and other financial aid sources these awards are supplemented to ensure
              full- tuition for the first year and subsequent years through graduation in one
              of the designated majors. Mentoring and exposure to professionals in the field
              has proven to be very important for retention and graduation of students in
              SMET undergraduate majors. The CSEMS program provides students with
              professional mentors and summer internship in industry or research experiences
              in University laboratories or off campus. Industrial and external sponsorship
              of the TSU CSEMS program and students are significant.
