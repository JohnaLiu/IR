Abstract    :
              Wheeling Jesuit University has created the Women in Math/ Computer Science
              Scholarship Program (WIM/ CS) to encourage women in the Appalachian region to
              continue their studies at the baccalaureate level. This program provides ten
              scholarships per year to women graduates of community or technical colleges who
              hold the A. S. degree in math or computer science to complete the bachelor's
              degree at Wheeling Jesuit. Taking advantage of its quality programs, its
              supportive faculty, and the presence of three technology centers on its campus,
              Wheeling Jesuit provides WIM/ CS scholars with a strong academic program and
              technology- related internship opportunities on its campus. The scholarships
              open new opportunities for women in math and computer science and also offer
              new talent to technology- related businesses and public school classrooms in
              the region.
