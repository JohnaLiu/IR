Abstract    :
              Funds are recommended for holding a US-Mexican workshop on the theme of "Rupture
              of Continental Lithosphere" as exemplified by the Gulf of California/Salton Sea
              Region.  The workshop is to be held in Puerta Vallarta, Mexico, on the Gulf of
              California in October 2000.  The Gulf of California/Salton Trough System has
              been chosen as one of the two focus sites under the MARGINS initiative and the
              workshop will bring together scientists from the two countries over two days to
              discuss the state of our knowledge about the area and to plan future research
              in this rupturing system.  Between 50 and 60 US and Mexican participants will
              attend the workshop.
