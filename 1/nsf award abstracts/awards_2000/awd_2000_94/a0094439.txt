Abstract    :
              This scholarship program provides funds to prepare computer science and
              mathematics students for graduation within two years of acceptance into the
              program and for successful entry into a career field related to their
              discipline or graduate study in computer science or mathematics. The objectives
              of this scholarship program are to increase the number of low income,
              academically qualified students obtaining undergraduate degrees in computer
              science and mathematics and to increase the number of advanced study and career
              and employment opportunities for participants in the program. The target group
              of candidates for this scholarship program is transfer students from community
              colleges. Support includes services provided by the Learning Center, Career
              Center, the Director of New Students and Retention and the Office of
              Multicultural Affairs. The Department of Mathematics, Computer Science and
              Physics, in conjunction with various campus offices, provides one-hour seminars
              each semester for participants on topics related to academic life and planning
              and preparing for entry into a career or advanced study.
