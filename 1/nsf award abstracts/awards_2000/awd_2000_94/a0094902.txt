Abstract    :
              This project attracts high ability minority students in engineering and computer
              science and subsequently retains them at the university through financial aid
              packages and supplemental scholarships. To accomplish this objective, a
              two-tier approach is used. First, they attract high ability high school
              students with scholarships. Second, they offer scholarships to beginning
              sophomores who have demonstrated good academic performance in their freshman
              year. Finally, they retain high ability students with a Six Sigma approach to
              engineering and computer science education (improvement of the process quality
              by constant monitoring and adjustment). Other retention activities include
              comprehensive faculty mentoring, tutorial programs, advising and counseling,
              involvement in research, and summer internships.
