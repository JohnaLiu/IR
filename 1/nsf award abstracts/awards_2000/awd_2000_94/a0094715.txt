This project is to expand the scope of nonaqueous
              stereoselective biocatalytic conversions to include oxidoreductases, another
              biotechnologically promising class of enzymes.  It will include the
              investigation of asymmetric oxidations of organic sulfides (thioethers) to
              chiral sulfoxides and reductions of chiral hydroperoxides to chiral alcohols
              catalyzed by the model enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in organic solvents.
               For both of these enzymatic processes, the rates and stereoselectivities will
              be kinetically examined as a function of the solvent in order to identify the
              solvent's most influential parameters.  In these studies, HRP will be suspended
              in organic solvents either as a lyophilized powder (the most common mode of
              enzyme use in nonaqueous media) or as lightly cross-linked crystals (in which
              enzymes tend to retain their native structure in organic solvents).  The
              cross-linked crystal mode will allow a test of the hypothesis that the solvent
              dependence of HRP's stereoselectivity is primarily due to the differential
              energetics of substrate desolvation in the corresponding enzyme-bound
              transition states.  This will be accomplished by combining the kinetic analysis
              with structure-based molecular modeling, followed by semiempirical
              thermodynamic calculations.  Additional complementary strategies for enhancing
              HRP catalysis in organic solvents will be explored, including bioimprinting
              with a variety of ligands and temporarily engaging the substrate in reversible
              molecular complexes.
