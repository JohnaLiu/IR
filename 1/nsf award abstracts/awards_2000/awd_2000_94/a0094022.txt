Abstract    :
              0094022:  Re-engineering of Construction Processes and Education for Sustainable
              Development.

This reserch focuses on sustainable construction and entails
              developing models and methods for defining and quantifying the environmental
              effects of specific construction processes (excavation, cast-in-place concrete,
              structural steel erection, structural wood, and demolition).  The impacts will
              be traced through the related life-cycles and supply chains for material and
              energy inputs, water comsumption, wastewater generation, hazardous and
              non-hazardous waste generation, heavy metal discharges, and greenhouse gas as
              well as particulate matter emissions.  Standardized life-cycle assessment
              methods will be coupled with existing construction process models.  This
              information augmented with private and social cost estimates of the impacts
              will serve to identify environmentally preferable or improved construction
              processes.  The broader implications of the research are the promise of global
              environmental improvements in construction, one of the largest and most
              important sectors or the US economy.

The research plan complements an
              innovative education plan involving explicit integration of research results
              into existing courses and professional education, case studies, a role-playing
              game, workshops and seminars for private sector partners, special institutional
              undergraduate and minority-owned construction business programs and high
              school.
