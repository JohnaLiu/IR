Abstract    :
              This project targets low-income computer science, mathematics, engineering or
              engineering technology lower-division students and 1) increases the number of
              low- income, academically talented SDSM& T students in CSEMS fields, who
              successfully enter the major after completing two years of undergraduate study,
              2) increases the number of these students qualifying for departmental
              scholarships, 3) increases awareness of and interaction with industry among
              these students, 4) provides these students with opportunities for relevant
              employment experience while undergraduates, and 5) increases the supply of
              qualified graduates to technology based industry, especially to local and
              regional employers. The project provides upper- level student mentors to work
              with CSEMS Scholars to ensure that they maximize their use of available support
              resources. Student mentors are responsible for conducting monthly coordination
              sessions, scheduling individual conferences as needed, providing assistance
              with issues/ problems, assisting in identifying academically related employment
              opportunities, keeping documentation records and tutoring/ directing students.
              Four specific activities ensure that CSEMS Scholars are introduced to the
              profession and are given opportunities to obtain relevant work experience while
              in school. These are 1) industry seminars, either on- site or via
              teleconferencing, 2) an alumni mentoring program, 3) activities with
              recruiters, and 4) local employment and co- op opportunity promotion.
