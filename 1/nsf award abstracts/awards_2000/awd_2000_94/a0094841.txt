This project provides scholarships to qualified minority students
              enrolled in computer science, engineering, and mathematics disciplines. The
              program leverages the activities of an existing Minority Engineering Program in
              support of the scholars. Scholars are mentored by both upper class students and
              alumni, participate in regular group meetings, and are encouraged to become
              involved in student activities within the college. Students at risk of failing
              physics are provided with an economic incentive to enroll in a special
              preparatory course and in the follow- on optional tutorial sections which
              feature state-of-the-art educational technologies that have been integrated
              with innovative pedagogy. Preliminary results show that the approach can
              significantly reduce the failure rate in the standard calculus-based physics
              course. By combining special classroom experiences with supportive services,
              the program seeks to retain talented, financially disadvantaged minority
              students pursuing in bachelor's degrees in computer science, engineering and
              mathematics.
