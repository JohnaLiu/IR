Abstract    :
              The Engineering Division is providing financial support to 45 students over a
              two- year period. These funds are used in conjunction with existing college
              programs to accomplish three goals: (1) increase enrollment of underrepresented
              groups in the engineering division, (2) improve retention rates among women and
              minority students within the engineering division, and (3) establish a stable
              cadre of women and minority students in the engineering division. In order to
              achieve these goals, Lafayette's Engineering Division is implementing five
              programs designed to complement the existing support programs. The new programs
              include (1) facultyalumni- administrator mentoring teams individually assembled
              to meet the needs of each CSEMS scholar, (2) enhanced academic support
              services, in particular, a big sister/ brother program, which are undertaken
              with the assistance of student members of the Society of Women Engineers, the
              Minority Scientists and Engineers Club, and Tau Beta Pi, the national
              engineering honors society, (3) targeted experiential engineering educational
              opportunities including internships and student- faculty research, (4)
              increased interactions with the career services staff during the students'
              first and second years at Lafayette, and (5) a new seminar series featuring
              prominent Lafayette engineering alumni.
