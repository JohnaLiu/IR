Abstract    :
              This project combats the shortage of mathematicians, computer scientists, and
              engineers by supporting 40 academically talented, low- income students who are
              making the transition from a two- year to a four- year institution. We provide
              these students with a strong support infrastructure and resources they need to
              graduate and find rewarding careers in engineering, mathematics, and computer
              science. Supporting activities take place in the student's final year of study
              at the community college and continue in his/ her first year at the four- year
              institution, including: faculty mentors; forums promoting interaction with
              faculty, industry representatives, and other students; and academic tutoring. 
              Students are encouraged to take part in professional societies, co- op
              experiences, and research opportunities.  We will assist graduates with job
              placement and/ or application for graduate school.
