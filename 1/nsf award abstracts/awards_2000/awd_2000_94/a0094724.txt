W. Schultz, University of Michigan


A novel method,
              by which the classroom instructor becomes the ally of the student in his/her
              preparation for examination questions provided by a consortium of faculty
              members (fluid dynamics) has been proposed.  This workshop, and its follow-on
              efforts, has also gained the support of the DUE Program Directors.  It is
              expected that the evolved structure can become a model for other undergraduate
              courses in the engineering sciences.
