Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemical Instrumentation Program and the Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities, Jeffrey I. Steinfeld of Massachusetts Institute
              of Technology will convene an NSF Instrumentation for Environmental Science,
              2000 Workshop.  The focus of the workshop will be on identifying key
              measurement needs in environmental science and emerging measurement
              technologies that could have a significant impact on environmental
              measurements.  Some unique challenges that may be further discussed at the
              workshop include (i) finding the signal in the noise; (ii) the highly complex
              sample environment; and (iii) in situ versus remote sensing, among others.  The
              overall goal is to assist NSF in planning its programs and funding priorities
              for analytical instrumentation that will provide reliable, cost-effective
              environmental measurement techniques. The workshop will be held on November
              10-12, 2000, in Dedham, Massachusetts, just outside Boston.  Approximately 40
              scientists from academia, government and industry will participate.  The
              workshop will prepare a report and present its findings at the Pittsburgh
              Conference in March, 2001.
