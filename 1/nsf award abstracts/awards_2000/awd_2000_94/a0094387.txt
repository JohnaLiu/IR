Abstract    :
              The project will improve our understanding of the evolution and predictability
              of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). MJO is a key component of
              intra-seasonal variability, and plays a significant role in modulating the
              circulation and precipitation variability in the global tropics and the
              mid-latitude Pacific/North American region. MJO also influences the
              Asian-Australian summer monsoons and possibly even El Nino--Southern
              Oscillation (ENSO) variability, thereby extending its impact on major climate
              systems. MJO remains a notable and somewhat intractable simulation deficiency
              in extant general circulation models, and one in need of an urgent fix in view
              of its substantial impact on both weather and climate. Drs. Duane Waliser
              (SUNY, Stony Brook) and Charles Jones (Univ. of California, Santa Barbara) will
              collaboratively investigate the extent of ocean's influence on MJO evolution
              from modeling experiments with a thermally and dynamically responsive ocean
              model. They will also estimate the limit of forecast predictability of the MJO
              and its implications for medium-to-extended range weather prediction and
              intraseasonal-to-interannual climate variability using the NASA/GSFC and
              NOAA/GFDL general circulation models. Dr. William Lau of NASA/GSFC and William
              Stern of NOAA/GFDL will be collaborating on some of the project tasks.
