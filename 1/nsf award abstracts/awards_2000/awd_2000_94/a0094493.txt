Abstract    :
              This project is designed to increase opportunities for students to successfully
              complete degree programs in engineering, telecommunications engineering,
              electronics technology, mathematics, and computer science. Objectives of the
              CSEMS project are to increase the matriculation, retention, and graduation
              rates of students enrolled in five degree programs, establish new and enhance
              existing support programs for students, increase the awareness of high school
              students about the opportunities in the CSEMS fields, increase partnerships
              with industry and government agencies for internships and permanent hires of
              the CSEMS scholarship graduates, and create assessment tools that will be used
              to monitor the impact of the CSEMS project on the community. Internships are an
              important component to the CSEMS project. Special effort is being given to
              strengthening existing relationships with industry and identifying new sources
              of internships for CSEMS students in the private and government sectors.
              Forging new partnerships with the private sector enhance CSEMS students'
              opportunities for terminal employment.
