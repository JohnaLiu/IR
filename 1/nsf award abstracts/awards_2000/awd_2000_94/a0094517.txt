Abstract    :
              This project supports students of high ability and financial need to pursue
              studies in Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CSEM) . The
              objective of the program is to provide academic opportunities to students who
              otherwise might not be able to achieve these goals, to provide an improved
              education with academic support courses, and to improve their retention rate by
              lowering their employment load. A committee of key personnel from the CSEM
              departments at the university, Bakersfield (CSUB) oversees this program and
              develops the academic support structure which is necessary to provide
              encouragement to the students as they move towards graduation in their chosen
              fields.
