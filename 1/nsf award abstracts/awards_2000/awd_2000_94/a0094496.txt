Abstract    :
              Do people invest differently in groups than as individuals? Do men invest
              differently than women? This project looks at both issues by analyzing the
              stock portfolios of approximately 1000 investment clubs throughout the U.S. The
              issues at stake are important to scholars as well as to business managers and
              people in the financial industry. In the business world, most investment
              decisions are made in groups; in fact, some of the most important market movers
              are groups, such as the Federal Reserve Board. Yet little is known about how
              group settings affect investment decisions or performance. One of the most
              important aspects of group process is gender composition; for example, it has
              long been known in sociology that people behave very differently in same-sex
              groups versus "mixed company." By incorporating these insights, this study will
              build a more accurate theory of the social underpinnings of economic behavior.
