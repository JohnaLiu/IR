Abstract    :
              This project seeks to investigate robotic control and assembly of objects in the
              millimeter and nanometer range, respectively. Specific topics of research
              include developing motion control techniques and algorithms for atomic force
              positioning and force-feedback manipulation systems and for micro and
              nano-robotic systems that include micro and molecular scale actuators (e.g.,
              motors, pumps, etc.). Various proposed designs for these actuators will also be
              investigated, and realistic 
physical models will be formulated for such
              systems, including (i) environments on flat surfaces, and (ii) fluid
              environments (e.g., micro-fluid-MEMS architectures, and robotic systems that
              move in fluid environments). As one application, the development of a MEMS
              scale Babbage machine will be investigated, which is a micro-scale mechanical
              
computing machine, with the long term aim of building nano-scale programmable
              machines. The proposed research is of high risk due to the uncertainty in all
              the essential properties of the molecules to be manipulated and lack of a
              complete characterization of the physical properties of the manipulation
              systems at this micro and molecular scale.
