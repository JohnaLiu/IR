Abstract    :
              Twenty-five lower-division undergraduate and fifteen graduate students in
              computer science, statistics or mathematics are being supported via financial
              aid, internships, group sessions, and outside speakers. As they enter the
              program, they receive an intensive orientation. As they progress through the
              program, they receive close monitoring to ensure their success via bi-weekly
              meetings with the PI and monthly group meetings. Students are organized into
              peer study groups to encourage performance in computer science and mathematics
              courses.
