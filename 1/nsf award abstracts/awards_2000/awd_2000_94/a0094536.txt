Abstract    :
              Drawing on research into the cultural construction of technology and research on
              the objectification of culture in heritage movements, this dissertation
              research project examines the "industrial romanticism" which underlies the
              restoration of World War 11 airplanes, known as warbirds. Industrial
              romanticism is seen as a contrast to traditional, pastoral romanticism that
              characterizes most heritage movements. Through an ethnographic investigation of
              warbird groups and airshows, this project will examine warbirds' inversion of
              traditional romanticism's anti-modernist view of technology. This project will
              therefore shed light a new form of romanticism by examining the remaking or
              reinvention of an obsolete technology as an objectification of the past.
              Ethnographic research will be conducted in mostly Southern California, in the
              maintenance hangars of warbird groups, in the workshops of warbird restorers,
              at warbird museums, and at airshows. In addition to participant observation in
              these sites, the researcher will interview private owners of warbirds and other
              types of people involved in warbirds outside of the main research sites.
