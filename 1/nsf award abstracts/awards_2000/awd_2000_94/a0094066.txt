Abstract    :
              Dr. Lisa Berreau, Department of Chemistry, Utah State University, is supported
              by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program, Division
              of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, through a Career Award for her work
              in which a new class of chelating nitrogen/sulfur ligands containing hydrogen
              bond donors will be developed. Complexes with zinc hydroxide, alkoxide and
              bicarbonate stabilized by internal hydrogen-bonds will be synthesized and
              characterized to determine structure/function relationships for several
              metalloenzymes toward design of new catalysts for the oxidation of alcohols,
              hydration of carbon dioxide, and hydrolytic cleavage of amides. In the
              educational front, a new bioinorganic chemistry course utilizing cooperative
              learning techniques, and two new undergraduate laboratory courses also
              incorporating bioinorganic chemistry elements will be developed.

Students
              will receive a broad-based training in inorganic chemistry with significant
              insights into the chemistry of biological systems. The catalysts that will be
              developed are of technological importance.
