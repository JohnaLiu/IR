Abstract    :
              This project provides low-income, academically talented students with
              scholarships for tuition, fees and equipment. The objectives are to increase
              retention of students through gateway classes to their majors and prepare them
              for industry and government internships that enhance their academic experience.
              Advising and group study activities address personal barriers to continuation
              through academic support via one-on-one interaction with computer science and
              mathematics faculty. Career counseling and workshops help to increase the
              students' competitiveness in the job market.
