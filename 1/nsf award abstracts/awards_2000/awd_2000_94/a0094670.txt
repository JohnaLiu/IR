Abstract    :
              Laboratory studies of the visible and near infrared photochemistry of a number
              of nitrates (nitric acid, peroxynitric acid, and peroxyacetyl nitrate) will be
              performed. These compounds are formed via the recombination of nitrogen
              radicals with organic or odd hydrogen radicals, and can be transported over
              long distances. Photolysis of these compounds regenerates radicals which
              influence the production and destruction rate of ozone in the troposphere and
              stratosphere. It is possible that the importance of photolysis of these
              nitrates compared to other sink processes has been underestimated in the past.
