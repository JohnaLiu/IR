Abstract    :
              The Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics Scholarships (CSEMS) afford
              the College the opportunity to encourage academically talented students who are
              economically disadvantaged to pursue degrees in engineering technology. The
              CSEMS also can provide more insight into the College's retention issue through
              the program's use of various assessment tools such as student satisfaction
              surveys and student-based logs. Finally, the CSEMS are increasing student
              employment in technology-based jobs. Incoming freshmen pursuing an associate's
              in applied science degree in aeronautical technology and an associate's in
              applied science degree in computerized design and animated graphics, and
              College students who have already completed 64 credits toward a bachelor's of
              science, are eligible to compete for the scholarships. Admission into the
              program is based on the following criteria: grade point average, class
              standing, recommendations, Scholastic Aptitude Test scores and an interview.
              The College provides support for the CSEMS recipients in their pursuit of a
              degree in engineering technology. There are programs such as faculty mentoring
              and a technology seminar series devised to assist the recipients to achieve
              academic success. In addition, the College sponsors many activities such as
              faculty/recipient socials, which reinforce the objectives the College hopes to
              accomplish through CSEMS. Finally, the College is providing the recipients many
              opportunities to interact with industry representatives, both on and off
              campus, through internships, job fairs and industry- recipient luncheons.
