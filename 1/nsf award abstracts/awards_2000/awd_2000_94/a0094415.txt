Abstract    :
              
Nutrient and iron addition experiments are a basic oceanographic tool that has
              resulted in major advances in our knowledge of controls on oceanic productivity
              and carbon cycling.  However, most of the shipboard and in-situ work carried
              out to date has involved additions of limiting nutrients that are one to two
              orders higher than ambient levels, resulting in massive blooms that are not
              typically observed in the natural ecosystems being investigated.  For this
              reason, it is necessary to understand the consequences of continuous iron and
              nutrient inputs at realistic concentrations on phytoplankton community
              structure and oceanic carbon cycling.  The principal investigators from the
              University of Delaware and the University of Charleston will carry out this
              type of experiment in the Southern Ocean utilizing their natural community
              chemostat system.  This system delivers iron and nutrients at natural levels to
              incubated shipboard experiments at continuous flow rates that simulate
              real-world vertical advection processes.  The specific goals of the proposed
              research is to address the following four questions:  (1) How does
              phytoplankton species composition respond to changes in iron concentrations in
              upwelled water?; (2) What effect will variability in upwelling rates at a give
              iron concentration have on community structure?; (3) How does iron chemical
              speciation affect the composition of phytoplankton communities?; and (4) How
              will a changing iron supply affect the production of biogenic sulfur?
