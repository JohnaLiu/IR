Abstract    :
              The investigators will study structural and dynamical features of small-scale,
              dispersive Alfven waves in magnetized, strongly inhomogeneous, low-beta
              laboratory and space plasmas.  Dispersive Alfven waves generated at the
              equatorial plane of the magnetosphere may transport electromagnetic power into
              the ionosphere and can be responsible for small-scale, intense electric fields
              and currents in the topside auroral ionosphere and in discrete auroral arcs. 
              The study will used a model based on the reduced two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic
              (MHD) kinetic equations which incorporate effects of finite electron and ion
              masses, temperatures, and kinetic effects of the finite ion Larmor radious in
              the fluid description of ultra-low-frequency electromagnetic waves in a
              magnetized plasma.  To understand the range of applicability of the reduced MHD
              description of dispersive Alfven waves, the investigators will verify the
              physical model and its numerical implementation on a large set of
              well-controlled, comprehensive experimental data.  In particular, the effort
              involves testing the results of theoretical models with laboratory plasma
              experiments performed on the Large Plasma Device at UCLA.  Results of the study
              will be applied to further the capability to interpret intense fields, currents
              and particle fluxes measured in the auroral zone on rockets and satellites as
              well as to advance understanding of laboratory plasma experiments.
