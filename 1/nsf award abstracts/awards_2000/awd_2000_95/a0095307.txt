Abstract    :
              The University of Texas Institute for Geophysics maintains a seismic reflection
              archive containing data collect by UT investigators between 1974 and 1987. 
              Additional data will be added from more recent UT investigations.  All data wil
              be archived on a web-based, SQL-searchable database.  The primary objective is
              to organize the field data, processed sections, navigations and images in a
              form that will be useful to investigators at UTIG and elsewhere.
