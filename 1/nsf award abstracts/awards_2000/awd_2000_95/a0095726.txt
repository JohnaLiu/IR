Abstract    :
              This proposal is for the creation of 20 modules of instruction that would be
              based on technology education, problem-solving activities that are part of the
              curriculum of the Technology Student Association (TSA), and that are consistent
              with standards for technological literacy as published by the International
              Technology Education Association (ITEA).  Science and mathematics content would
              be added to these TSA activities.  The grade levels would be middle and high
              school.  For the middle school level units include Cyberspace pursuit, Dragster
              design challenge and Flight challenge.  At the high school level units include
              electronic systems, manufacturing prototype and radio-controlled
              transportation.  The project will extend over four years.  Materials will be
              piloted and field-tested by TSA and non-TSA teachers, in North Carolina,
              Florida, Oklahoma and Virginia.
