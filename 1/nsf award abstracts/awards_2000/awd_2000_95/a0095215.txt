Abstract    :
              Fast unimolecular rectifiers of electrical current, at the ultimate molecular,
              i.e. nanometer-scale limit, should occur in molecules that satisfy, in our
              opinion, three conditions: (1) They should belong to the types D-pi-A or
              D-sigma-A (D = one-electron donor, pi = covalent "pi-electron" bridge or sigma
              = covalent " sigma-electron" bridge, A = one-electron acceptor), (20 They
              should undergo large changes of their dipole moment between their
              intramolecular intervalence transfer transition.  We have demonstrated that a
              zwitterionic D=pi-A molecule, hexadecylquinolinium tricyanoquinodimethanide
              (where there is internal electron transfer from D to A in the ground state), is
              indeed a unimolecular rectifier, between 370 degrees Kelvin and 105 degrees
              Kelvin, by both nanoscopic methods (scanning tunneling microscopy in air) and
              macroscopic methods (electrical measurements on "aluminum | monolayer |
              aluminum" sandwiches, and also "gold | monolayer | gold: sandwiches).

For
              that work, we relied on Langmuir-Blodgett film assembly technology (using a
              long-chain alkane termination), whose advantage is that it forms compact,
              well-packed layers, which however may be metastable in orientation, especially
              under intense electric fields.  To make the rectifiers more sturdy and less
              likely to reorient, we propose to (1) use covalent self-assembly (add silane
              terminations in the molecule for attachment to OH-covered Si substrates); (2)
              incorporate polymerizable groups in the molecules.  We also propose (3) a
              molecular transistor, by interspersing between two D-sigma-A or two D-pi-A
              molecules an electrically addressable gate film, or a gate electrode with a
              suitable geometry, and thus provide the world's first three-terminal
              unimolecular device with electronic gain.
