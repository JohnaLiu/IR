Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              provides continued support for research on weakly coordinating anions by Dr.
              Christopher A. Reed, Chemistry Department, University of California at
              Riverside.  The goal of the project is to develop the chemistry of partially
              chlorinated carborane anions. These anions are non-nucleophilic and
              non-oxidizing, providing a non-reactive "least coordinating anion". Acids such
              as H(CB11H6Cl6) are superacidic yet otherwise gentle reagents. This combination
              of properties makes it possible to study protonation of very weak bases such as
              buckminsterfullerenes, hydrocarbons, and noble gases. The superacid chemistry
              will be extended to "supermethyl" and "superoxidant" reagents.

Acid-base
              reactions are among the most fundamental and important reactions in chemistry
              and biology. This research explores the extremes of acid behavior. Development
              of this chemistry has implications for numerous chemical processes, including
              olefin polymerization, petroleum cracking, boron neutron capture therapy and
              battery technology.  It may lead to new chemical reagents and selective
              catalysts.
