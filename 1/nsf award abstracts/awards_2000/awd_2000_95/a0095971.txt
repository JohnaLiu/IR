Abstract    :
              0095971/Rhines

The project addresses two questions associated with the
              spin-up of 
rotating, stratified fluids like the ocean.  The first concerns
              the 
effect of nonlinear coupling between the Ekman pumping induced by wind
              
stress curl and the vorticity of the interior geostrophic flow generated 
by
              the Ekman pumping.  The second concerns the generation of convective 
and
              inertial instabilities by the advection of horizontal density 
gradients in
              the Ekman layer by Ekman fluxes, together with the vertical 
mixing these
              instabilities produce.  The work consists of the 
development and study of
              analytical and numerical models of 
three-dimensional representations of these
              phenomena together with 
experiments to reproduce these phenomena in the
              laboratory and to test 
the theoretical and numerical predictions.  Numerical
              simulations will 
be extended to a model of coastal upwelling.  The work
              builds on 
two-dimensional theoretical and numerical models of these
              
processes.
