              0095640 Smyth
Direct numerical simulations of turbulent overturns will be
              extended to case more directly relevant to the ocean thermocline. The present
              results based on simulations of turbulence developing and decaying in an
              unforced shear layer show that mixing is more efficient in the pre-turbulent
              developing phase than in the fully turbulent decaying phase. The speculation is
              that the observed difference in mixing efficiency among the various ocean flow
              regimes depends on the relative time spent in the pre-turbulent phase as
              opposed to the fully developed turbulence. If so, then the nature of the
              forcing may determine the efficiency of mixing, a valuable simplification. A
              series of experiments with steady and episodic forcing will conducted to test
              this conjecture. In addition, numerical simulations will examine differential
              diffusion in unforced and forced overturns to determine under which
              circumstances it is most important.
