Funding is requested for a 3-year renewal of the NSF portion
              of the Pacific High Resolution XBT/XCTD (HRX) network. This an ocean-spanning
              set of repeated eddy-resolving upper ocean transects with the objective of
              observing interannual variability in ocean circulation and the transport of
              mass, heat and freshwater. The program has now nearly a decade of quarterly
              repeat sections. Sampling will be continued with 800-m Deep Blue XBTs plus
              supplemental sampling with new 2000-m T-12 XBTs to determine deep geostrophic
              shear in Western boundary currents and on basin-wide scales. The HRX network is
              an important element of the Pacific plan developed by the CLImate VARiability
              and predictability Program (CLIVAR). Planned analyses during the next three
              years will focus on basin-wide synthesis of the HRX data and comparison with
              results from related data assimilation and modeling efforts.
