Ninety-seven years of hydrographic data from two large
              data sets will be used to study the continuity, response to topography, and
              seasonal and interannual variability of the shelf break system (jet and front)
              from the Denmark Strait to the Middle Atlantic Bight.  Since the flow is
              primarily geostrophic, the dominant transport signal will be captured by the
              temperature and salinity data without need to focus on the rarer direct current
              measurements from the system.  Outliers will be removed through an iterative
              procedure.  Data will be binned in space-time for analysis.  Where repeat
              sections occur, these will be analyzed using standard techniques.
