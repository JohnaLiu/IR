Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to develop a method to analyze the rare earth elements in
              small samples (1-4 ml) of sediment pore water, using a new high resolution
              ICPMS instrument available at SIO. The technique, if successful, will help in
              fundamental understanding of the behavior of REE in sediments, an important
              goal. In addition, with shiptime provided by Scripps, the PI will collect
              sediment cores from the California borderlands, where there exist large
              differences in the redox state of surface sediments. Analysis of pore waters in
              these cores will thus be useful for investigating the chemical behavior of the
              rare earth elements (REE) in sediment pore waters under different redox
              conditions
