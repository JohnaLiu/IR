Abstract    :
              0095382/Alford

This project involves the study of thermohaline intrusions in
              Puget 
Sound.  The study seeks to determine the relative contribution, to heat
              
and salt fluxes at the edges of the intrusion, of shear-generated
              
turbulence and doubly diffusive processes.  The work will involve a
              
two-ship survey of an intrusion within the Sound and subsequent data
              
analysis.  It is anticipated that the work will provide information 
about a
              basic question in geophysical fluid dynamics, the way in which 
two distinct
              processes, shear turbulence and double diffusion, 
contribute to small scale
              mixing when both are present.  The work will 
also provide information on the
              structure and evolution of a type of 
feature, a thermohaline intrusion, known
              to be present in many oceanic 
situations, particularly near thermohaline
              fronts, but not yet well 
studied.  Last, the work will evaluate an
              experimental approach for 
possible future use in the study of thermohaline
              intrusions in a more 
oceanic setting.
