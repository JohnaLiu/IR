The goal of this proposal is
              the determination of the critical conditions for the onset of cavitation in
              high Reynolds number turbulent boundary layers and shear flows.  This is an
              important problem in industrial applications involving flow of liquids. To
              accomplish this goal, it is proposed to use new experimental techniques
              including triple-exposure 2-D PIV and 3-D Holographic PIV to measure the
              instantaneous pressure and velocity fields simultaneously.  The experimental
              results will be used to guide and validate the development of numerical codes
              for the prediction of the critical conditions for cavitation inception.
