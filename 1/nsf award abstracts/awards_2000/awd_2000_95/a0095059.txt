Abstract    :
              0095059/Helfrich

This project addresses the dynamics of buoyant coastal
              plumes of the 
sort produced by fresh-water river discharge.  The main goal is
              to 
provide a quantitative description of buoyant coastal currents over a
              
sloping bottom.   The structure of such currents will be explored with 
a
              combination of analysis of existing observational data, laboratory
              
experiments and numerical modeling.  Existing theoretical estimates of 
the
              width of the current, the depth of the offshore edge, and the speed 
of
              advance of the nose of the current will be tested.  The observational 
data
              are from an experiment in the Chesapeake Plume.  The laboratory 
data will
              come from experiments in a rotating tank.  The numerical model 
is a version
              of the Princeton Ocean Model (ECOM3d).
