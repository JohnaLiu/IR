Abstract    :
              The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry,
              National Science Foundation, supports the work of Prof. George W. Flynn,
              Department of Chemistry, Columbia University, for his work on elucidating the
              factors that control self-assembly, molecular structure, and functional group
              conformation in chiral and achiral molecular films physisorbed at liquid-solid
              interfaces. A rather unique Scanning Tunneling Microscopy approach will be
              developed and used to determine chemical structure and dynamics at these
              interfaces.

The results of the study will be of fundamental interest and of
              practical importance in the design of self-assembled interfaces. The
              observation, control and manipulation of these interfaces will be significant
              in the development of next generation microscopic optical and electronic
              devices, chemical sensors, and biomedical monitors that function on the
              nanoscale dimension. Undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral
              associates will acquire considerable experience and skills in a variety of
              physical methods in the developing field of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology.
