The
              first discovery of chemoautotrophic community living on a seafloor whale-fall
              carcass was made in the Santa Catalina Basin in 1987.  Subsequent discoveries
              in the Pacific and the fossil record confirm that such communities are
              widespread in the modern ocean and have occurred over evolutionary timespans. 
              The communities supported by the whale-fall environment bear taxonomic
              similarities to other deep-sea reducing environments, such as hydrothermal
              vents, and may occur with an average spacing of an order of magnitude smaller
              than that for vent fields.  Whale-falls are of biogeographical significance for
              the following reasons: 1) they enhance the biodiversity of the deep-sea; 2)
              they can provide insights into the effect of anthropogenic influences, such as
              sewage sludge emplacement and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on the
              marine environment; and 3) their potential roles as stepping stones for
              sulfophilic species in the deep-sea. The proposed work will continue to develop
              radiochemical methods (using thorium, radon and lead isotopes) for estimating
              the ages of seafloor whalebone communities. Preliminary measurements, using
              radiochemical methods, performed on known age bone samples yield isotopic ages
              that are in good agreement with known ages.  The proposed work will undertake
              the following: 1) establishment of a final protocol for the dating techniques
              previously developed and make this product available to the scientific
              community; 2) initiate the study of lipid content and lipid characterization on
              dated bone material to assess the residence time of lipids within fallen whale
              skeletons; 3) attempt to assess a record of pollution, particularly persistent
              organic pollutants (PCB, DDT) within well-dated skeletal remains of whales; and
              4) determine rates of development, patterns of succession, and persistence
              times of whale-fall chemoautotrophic communities.
