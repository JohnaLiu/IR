Abstract    :
              This work will integrate magnetic anomaly, geochemical, and paleointensity data
              to address a variety of ridge crest processes.  The working hypothesis is that
              coherent features in the magnetic anomaly/inversion records, especially within
              the Brunhes including the Central Anomaly Magnetic High, are most probably due
              to geomagnetic intensity variations.  A magnetic study of submarine and rock
              core samples from the East Pacific Rise near 9 degrees north will be conducted
              to corroborate the geomagnetic origin of critial features in the anomaly
              patters with glass paleointensities, establish if there is indeed a link
              between the glass paleointensities and basalt magnetizations, and explore the
              utility of the glass paleointensities as a dating tool.
