Abstract    :
              The primary objective of this project is the assemblage of an extensive and
              definitive database on the personal, career, and political attributes of
              commissioners and board members who have been appointed to independent federal
              agencies since 1892.  The database will include qualification and background
              variables, such as political party affiliation, gender, race and ethnicity,
              age, education, and prior and subsequent employment for the entire history of a
              broad collection of important federal agencies.  In addition, the database will
              include the temporal sequence of prior and subsequent career experiences, and
              the timing of all relevant appointment, reappointment, and term expiration
              dates.  This information, together with the careful documentation  of seat
              numbers that will also be included in the dataset, will allow detailed analyses
              of membership change and transitions.  The near-term product arising from this
              project will be to facilitate studies of appointment patterns to independent
              agencies.   The longer-term objective of this project is to allow linking to
              voting data for commissioners, and the development of commissioner-based
              research on decision-making at independent agencies.  The dataset is expected
              to document approximately 1150 distinct appointments (or 800 distinct
              appointees) at 15 independent agencies between 1887 and 2000.

This database
              will be used widely by other scholars interested in this topic.
