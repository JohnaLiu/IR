Abstract    :
              The investigators will study the basic transport processes of the magnetospheric
              convecting plasma.  The effort concentrates on the electric current, momentum
              and heat flows in the magnetosphere and interaction between the magnetosphere
              and ionosphere.   Because the motion of a charged particle is described by a
              more accurate approximation than the guiding center approximation and each
              species of the plasma is treated separately, this study will provide new
              insight into magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.  The ultimate aim is to improve
              on the traditional guiding field line approach to describing the motion of
              particles in electric and magnetic fields.  The project will also strengthen
              the newly established space research program at Prairie View A&M, a historic
              black university, and increase minority participation in space research.
