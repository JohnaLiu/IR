Abstract    :
              This project consists of an analysis of the intermediate depth circulation in
              the South Atlantic.  The analysis will combine information from a variety of
              quasi-Lagrangian float data collected during WOCE and other contemporary
              experiments.  The project will produce an internally consistent set of float
              velocity data from the various deployments, establish an estimate of the mean
              intermediate depth flow field and its variance, and estimate the mean and eddy
              fields of kinetic energy.  This data set and these derived fields will be used,
              together with available hydrographic and current meter data, to develop an
              understanding of the intermediate circulation in the South Atlantic and
              estimates of the heat and salt transports associated with it.
