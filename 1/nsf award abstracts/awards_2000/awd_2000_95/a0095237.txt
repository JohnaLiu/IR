Abstract    :
              A workshop is proposed to investigate the potential benefits of using smart
              sensor technology to monitor the performance of civil engineering systems.
              Promising applications will be identified for structural health monitoring
              under service load conditions and after natural or human-caused disasters (i.e.
              earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, explosions). Current barriers to implementing
              this technology will be identified, and a research agenda will be developed to
              promote implementation within the civil engineering community.

The workshop
              will be held in Austin, Texas in April 2001. Twenty researchers from around the
              US will be invited to participate.
