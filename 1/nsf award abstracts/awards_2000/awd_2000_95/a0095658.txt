Abstract    :
              The existence of racial residential segregation in United States cities means
              that blacks often lack the access to schools, parks, and other opportunities
              enjoyed by whites.  Some argue that residential segregation and the
              geographical isolation of blacks from whites in large metropolises has
              contributed to the emergence of an underclass, and to racial differences in
              earnings, schooling, and single parenting.  Using the decennial censuses, the
              only source of information about residential segregation, researchers have done
              much to understand the causes and consequences of this form of racial and
              ethnic inequality.  This project extends such research using data on the
              distribution of racial and ethnic groups down to the city block from the 2000
              Census.  It produces three papers based on computing multiple indices of
              residential segregation for American cities.  One describes segregation levels
              in 2000 and their correlates.  Another explores and measures the implications
              of the new race categories for the analysis of segregation, and a third tests
              hypotheses about changes in segregation since 1980.

The findings from this
              project describe baseline information about the levels of racial residential
              segregation in American metropolises in 2000, how the new multi-race census
              question confounds the measurement of segregation, and how residential
              segregation has changed in the recent past.  Moreover, the analysis tests
              several hypotheses in the literature by examining how levels and changes in
              city size, housing stock, size of minority populations, economic status of
              minority groups, and industry employment affect segregation.  The results have
              important implications for housing and discrimination policies, and for
              theories of racial inequality and urban change.
