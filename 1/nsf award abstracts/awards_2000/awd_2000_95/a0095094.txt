Abstract    :
              The Land Model Working Group of the Community Climate Systems Model (CCSM) has
              completed a prototype core single-column land model, designated the Community
              Land Model (CLM), and has demonstrated its success, as well as identified areas
              for further improvement. One of the areas that requires immediate improvement
              is runoff. The PI has developed an improved treatment of grid-scale run off by
              accounting for topographic influence on soil moisture heterogeneity and run off
              characteristics. Preliminary testing on regional and global scales shows the
              model performs satisfactorily. Under this award, the PI will complete
              testing/finalizing of the runoff scheme in CLM,  and ensure its successful
              implementation in CSM. The work is important because it should provide a strong
              diagnostics underpinning to the CCSM project from a university based group
              engaged in dynamical diagnosis of observed climate variability.
