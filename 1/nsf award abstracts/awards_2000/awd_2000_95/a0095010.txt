Abstract    :
              This research is an historical study focused on the introduction from Europe of
              two major innovations into the concrete construction industry of the United
              States: thin shell concrete structures and prestressed concrete. These two
              European innovations came to the United States during the first half of the
              20th century and subsequently had major impacts on American engineering. Each
              has a different history on this continent and those differences are important
              for this project as their similarities. Both cases reveal central aspects of
              twentieth century American construction and shed light on how American
              technological culture differs from that in Europe. The background for this
              scholarly work includes the experience of the principal investigator first in
              the history of technology, second in connecting scholarship to teaching, and
              third in both of the innovations to be studied. Since 1974 the principal
              investigator has focused a central part of his scholarship on historical
              studies. During the 1950s the principal investigator worked for the leading
              figures in each case and has since collected archival documents relating to
              both thin shells and prestressing. 

The study  examine the thin shell
              concrete roof structures and long-span roofs and bridges in prestressed
              concrete from the period 1900to 1960.  The main focus falls on the influence of
              two European-trained engineers who introduced these new ideas into American
              engineering practice: Anton Tedesko (1903-1994) for thin shells and Gustave
              Magnel (1889-1955) for prestressing.  The results of this study are to be three
              lengthy essays each of which will be submitted to a scholarly journal. A short
              essay on these two men, given as a lecture (in November 1999) upon receipt of
              the Sarton Medal from the University of Ghent, presents a preliminary sketch of
              the final works in this program and will be published by Ghent University in
              2000. The PI also plans a series of shorter articles in such journals as the
              American Scientist, Scientific American, The Journal of the Structural Division
              of ASCE, and Structural Engineering International.  Also sets of teaching
              materials will be prepared for use at Princeton and in other schools.
