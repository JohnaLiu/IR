Abstract    :
              

A series of dye studies and associated hydrographic and current measurements
              are proposed.  Dye will be released in the bottom layer of the Hudson River
              estuary and tracked in order to quantify diapycnal transport processes,
              secondary circulations, and horizontal transport in a stratified estuary.  Of
              particular interest will be the contributions of secondary circulations to
              vertical and horizontal exchange and their ultimate influence on the
              along-estuary momentum balance and dispersion rates.  The field study and
              analysis phases of the program will be complemented by numerical studies. 
              These efforts will test hypotheses concerning the failure of classical theories
              of estuarine circulation to explain observations.
