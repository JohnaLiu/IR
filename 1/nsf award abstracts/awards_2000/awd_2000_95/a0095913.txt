Abstract    :
              Chant - 0095913

A series of dye studies and associated hydrographic and
              current measurements are proposed.  Dye will be released in the bottom layer of
              the Hudson River estuary and tracked in order to quantify diapycnal transport
              processes, secondary circulations, and horizontal transport in a stratified
              estuary.  Of particular interest will be the contributions of secondary
              circulations to vertical and horizontal exchange and their ultimate influence
              on the along-estuary momentum balance and dispersion rates.  The field study
              and analysis phases of the program will be complemented by numerical studies. 
              These efforts will test hypotheses concerning the failure of classical theories
              of estuarine circulation to explain observations.
