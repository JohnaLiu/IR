Abstract    :
              0095688/Kelly
 
This project will analyze the transport and storage of heat in
              the upper 
ocean in the western North Atlantic.  A particular effort will be
              made 
to determine the interannual variability of these quantities and
              
identify the mechanisms responsible.  The project will be based on
              
historical data and use both in situ measurements and satellite-derived
              
surface fields.  The work will examine the roles of both surface 
buoyancy
              forcing and advective heat transport, focusing on the Gulf 
Stream and the
              adjacent recirculations.   Goals include developing a 
better understanding of
              the relations between variations in circulation 
and in sea-surface
              temperature, in sea-surface height and in heat 
storage, and between anomalies
              in heat storage and in sea-surface 
temperature.  The work will provide a
              better understanding of an 
important part of the climate system, the
              transport of heat between low 
and high latitudes by the ocean in the North
              Atlantic.  It will also 
provide an observational baseline against which ocean
              and climate models 
can be tested.
