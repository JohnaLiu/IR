Abstract    :
              0095834/Liu

The intent of this project is to develop an improved capability
              for 
modeling wave run-up on a beach, i.e. the swash zone.  One of the major
              
effects that the project will tackle is how to combine modeling of the 
free
              flow over the beach with the effects of exchange with flow within 
the
              permeable beach.   The approach will combine numerical modeling 
efforts with
              comparisons to data from field experiments in the swash 
zone on Californian
              beaches and from laboratory experiments to be 
conducted at Cornell.   The
              modeling approach is to combine a RANS 
model, presently used for flow over an
              impermeable beach, with a model 
for flow through a permeable beach.  An
              effort will be made to improve 
the modeling of flow within the beach by
              applying an analogue of the 
Reynolds averaging technique to flow in porous
              media.   In addition a 
depth averaged version of the RANS model will be
              modified to include 
parameterizations of the interaction with permeable
              beaches.   The 
laboratory work will look at the interaction of solitary waves
              and 
periodic wavetrains with several types of planar beach including smooth
              
impermeable, rough impermeable, and porous beaches.   The field results
              
that will be used to guide the model development are from experiments at
              
Scripps Beach and Torrey Pines Beach in San Diego.  These latter
              
experiments were carried out by B. Raubenheimer who is collaborating in
              
this project on a sub-contract from Cornell to WHOI.
