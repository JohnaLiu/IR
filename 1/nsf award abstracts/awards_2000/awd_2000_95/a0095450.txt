Abstract    :
              "Investigations in Number, Data and Space" is an elementary school mathematics
              curriculum which reflects research on, and best practices in, learning and
              teaching mathematics in grades K-5.  NSF funded the development of the original
              curriculum, starting in 1990.  This revision of the "Investigations" curriculum
              will focus on the integration of algebraic thinking throughout the curriculum,
              the development of comprehensive assessment tools, and the strengthening of the
              number and operations strand.  This work is informed by feedback from the
              field, as well as by recent recommendations for improving the mathematics
              curriculum.  These revisions will be carried out and tested in an established
              network of school system partners, teacher collaborators and educational
              leaders.  In addition to revising the curriculum, the project will develop
              materials to support teachers as they implement the curriculum.  Additional
              materials will be developed for parents and administrators.  The summative
              evaluation of the project will include longitudinal student achievement data,
              following two groups of students for three years each.  Cost sharing will
              include substantial contributions from the publisher, Scott Foresman, and the
              developer, TERC.
