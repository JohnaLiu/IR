Abstract    :
              This award provides partial funding for the 2001 FASEB Summer Conference on
              Autoimmunity to be held on June 30, 2001- July 5, 2001 at Vermont Academy in
              Saxtons River, Vermont.  The conference is held under the auspices of the
              Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology ( FASEB).  There will
              be 9 major oral sessions, each including, on average, three 30 minute talks and
              two 15 minutes talks per session. There will be two poster sessions, each
              lasting two days.

The topics for discussion are: Central and Peripheral
              Tolerance, Autoantigen Responses in Autoimmunity, Role of Infection in
              Autoimmunity, B cell Activation and Autoimmunity, Mechanisms of Peripheral
              Counter-Regulation, Antigen Presenting Cells in Shaping Pathogenic T cell
              Repertoire, Role of the Innate Immune system in Autoimmunity, Cytokines and
              Autoimmunity and Immunotherapy.

The purpose of the meeting is to bring
              together biochemists, biophysicists and geneticists to share information. The
              field is progressing rapidly and providing important new information on
              structure and mechanisms at the molecular level.

This is the sixth
              conference on the subject.  They are held every year, the first in 1991, and
              all are very well attended.
