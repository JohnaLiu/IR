Abstract    :
              Summary:  This objective of this study is to collect living and fossil deep sea
              corals from the New England Sea Mounts that will provide a depth transect from
              about 900 to 3000 meters.  The corals will then be used in a multiproxy study
              to deduce deep water circulation changes and relate changes in deep water
              circulation to climate changes inferred from ice core data.
