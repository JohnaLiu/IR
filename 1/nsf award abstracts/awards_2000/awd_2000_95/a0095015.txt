Abstract    :
              Researchers studying evolution and development consider questions regarding the
              origins, development, and transitions of fins to limbs, digits and external
              reproductive structures to be one of the fundamental issues in their
              discipline.  Although there are several theories regarding these issues in the
              transition of paired fins (pectoral) to fore limbs and paired fins (pelvic) to
              hind limbs, there are no theories regarding the transition of the median
              unpaired fin (anal) to external reproductive structures.  However, the body of
              research on paired fins to limb transitions in a variety of biological systems
              is sufficient enough that investigators should begin to synthesize what is
              known about the transitions of paired fins and extend that knowledge to the
              transition of the median unpaired fin to external reproductive structures.

A
              symposium entitled "Starting from Fins: Parallelism in the Evolution of Limbs
              and External Reproductive Structures" held at the Society for Integrative and
              Comparative Biology Conference in January 2001 will provide a forum for a group
              of scientists whose work focuses on the evolutionary, developmental,
              physiological, and phylogenetic parallelism between fins, limbs, digits and
              external reproductive structures.  Speakers will address issues of parallelism
              in development (i.e., the occurrence of analogous anatomical structures, genes,
              and developmental programs that present striking similarity of appearance). 
              They will address issues in serial homology (the repetition of morphologically
              identical segments and genes within individuals).  Finally, they will address
              changes in genes, anatomical structures, and developmental programs that may be
              linked to changes in function and habitat during an individual life history.  
              The overall objectives of this symposium are to 1) elucidate common
              evolutionary mechanisms in the development of fins, limbs and external
              reproductive structures and 2) provide presenters and participants an
              opportunity to begin a dialog on "big picture questions" regarding parallelism,
              serial homology, and transitions.
