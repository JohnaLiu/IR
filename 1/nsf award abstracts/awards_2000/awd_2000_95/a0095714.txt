Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to analyze for trace elements and isotopes, many hundreds of
              samples from Iceland, and the MAR. An important goal is to create a large data
              set of samples that all have major elements, trace elements and Sr, Nd, Pd, and
              Hf isotopes determined for each sample. With this data set, the PIs will try to
              answer a variety of specific questions/hypotheses related to the interaction of
              the Iceland plume with the MAR over a variety of spatial and temporal scales.
              These questions concern issues related to diverse mantle components, their
              origin and evolution, and discrimination between various components as mixing
              participants in the Icelandic and MAR lavas.
