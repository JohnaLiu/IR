Abstract    :
              Recent research suggests that the network structure in which individuals
              interact may have important economic consequences. For instance, while
              cross-country linkages between financial markets can be beneficial for
              diversification it also opens up the possibility of contagion of bad outcomes.
              In general, the network structure may determine which of several possible
              economic outcomes or `equilibria' are chosen and it may also affect the speed
              with which coordination on a particular equilibrium occurs. Besides studying
              behavior for a given network structure, the endogenous emergence of efficient
              network structures has also become an important theoretical research topic. To
              date, however, there has been little research of an applied nature. In this
              project we empirically test this theoretical work using controlled laboratory
              experiments with paid human subjects. 

These experiments advance our
              knowledge of whether network structures matter for equilibrium selection, and
              whether and when certain network structures arise endogenously. These are
              critical questions that lie at the heart of many poorly understood issues
              including the susceptibility of financial and other systems to ``panics'',
              sorting by gender, race or ethnicity, the emergence of trading patterns and
              trade agreements, technological adoption and ``lock-in'' to inferior
              technologies, and organizational design.
