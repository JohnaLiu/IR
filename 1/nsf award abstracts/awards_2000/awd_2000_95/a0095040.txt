Title: Regulation of Contralateral Cortical
              Projection by the EphA Receptors 

The human brain has been considered the
              most complex object in the universe known to man. Trillions of neurons are
              wired together precisely through thousands of times more connections. In this
              immensely complicated network, neurons are interconnected through wire-like
              processes called axons. How does this complex organ develop? What are the
              molecular signals that direct the formation of axon pathways and guide the
              growing axon tip toward proper target? These questions have fascinated
              scientists for centuries. Recent studies from our laboratory and the
              laboratories of others indicated that a family of cell surface molecules,
              termed receptors, that sense extracellular signals, play key roles in guiding
              axons. This project utilizes several molecular techniques to examine how the
              Eph receptors and their signaling partners regulate the formation of corpus
              callosum, an axon fiber that connects the two cerebral hemispheres, and is
              important for left and right coordination. Experiments examine where these
              molecules are located, how they affect axon growth and migration, and what are
              the effects on corpus callosum formation in development when these molecules
              are inactivated. Results from these studies will reveal the molecular mechanism
              of axon guidance and help to understand how this extremely complex organ, the
              brain, is wired together.
