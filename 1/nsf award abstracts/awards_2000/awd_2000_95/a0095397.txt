Abstract    :
              The investigators will perform a number of activities related to space weather
              educational and outreach efforts.  The confluence of a number of successful
              space weather related missions and research programs makes this an ideal time
              to inform the public about the drama of space weather and the value of space
              weather research.  The project will build on the success of previous
              accomplishments such as two museum exhibits called Electric Space and the Space
              Weather Center, a Space Weather brochure, the Solarscapes curricular module for
              middle school students, the Space Storms module for high school students and
              the Space Weather Center web site.  The investigators will continue these
              efforts with a Space Weather Education Network for educators, a program to
              educate teachers and parents about major space weather events, and an expanded
              web site to better serve a broader segment of the space weather community.
