Abstract    :

This project is aimed at demonstrating the effectiveness of
              gliders to observe boundary currents and describe an annual cycle of eastern
              boundary current evolution at the terminus of the West Wind Drift. Seagliders
              are small, reusable autonomous vehicles designed to glide from the ocean
              surface to as deep as 200 m and back while collecting profiles of physical,
              chemical and bio-optical properties. Two Seagliders will be deployed in
              successive missions up to 7.5 months long off the Washington coast to resolve
              the seasonal cycle of the California/Alaska Current system. All the data, about
              a thousand profiles of temperature and salinity will be transmitted in
              near-real time so that the progress of the gliders and current oceanic
              conditions can be monitored. Oxygen and bio-optical sensors will also be on the
              gliders. The work proposed is intended as a step forward toward learning to
              observe boundary currents over long time periods.
