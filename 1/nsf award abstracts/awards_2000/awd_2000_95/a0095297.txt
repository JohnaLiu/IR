Abstract    :
              High levels of ammonia are discharged from hydrothermal vents at sedimented
              (Guaymas Basin) and sediment-starved ridge systems (Endeavour Segment on the
              Juan de Fuca Ridge).  This ammonia may be an important substrate for the
              chemolithoautotrophic production of organic carbon, yet little, if any,
              attention has been focused on understanding the biogeochemistry of this
              hydrothermally-derived ammonia.  For this reason, the principal investigators
              working in collaboration with a scientist from Florida International
              University, plan to determine the rate of NH4+ removal and ascertain what
              fraction of this hydrothermally-injected NH4+ is consumed via oxidation by
              nitrification relative to assimilation by heterotrophic bacteria. In
              collaboration with a scientist from the University of Hawaii Biomedical
              Research Center, the population dynamics of the relevant nitrifying bacteria in
              an evolving hydrothermal plume will be determined.  The principal investigators
              also plan to assess the contribution of NH4+ oxidation to organic-C production
              in hydrothermal plumes.
