Abstract    :
              Funding is requested to conduct a high resolution study of late Pleistocene and
              Holocene ocean temperature and hydrographic variability archived in deep sea
              cores collected in 1998 within the Indo-Pacific warm pool region as part of the
              international paleoceanographic project IMAGES.  This project will produce the
              first records of climate variability in the tropical warm pool region at
              resolutions high enough for direct comparison with both high and low latitude
              ice core records.  This will allow testing of  the hypothesis that the warm
              pool did not cool more than 2 degrees C during the last glacial.  A Multiproxy
              (staple isotope, alkenone, Mg/CA) approach will be used to reconstruct sea
              surface temperatures, as well as deep and intermediate water temperatures for
              the last 150kyr.
