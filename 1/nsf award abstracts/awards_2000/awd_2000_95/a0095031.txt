Abstract    :
              David Hendrickson of the University of California, San Diego is supported by the
               Inorganic Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program in continued
              research on lattice dynamics and bistability of electronically labile
              complexes. The main focus of the research is on polynuclear Mn, Fe, V, and Ni
              complexes that function as single molecule magnets (SMMs). Valence tautomers of
              cobalt complexes will also be investigated. In SMMs, magnetism does not arise
              from interactions between molecules but from the circumstance that each
              individual molecule has a high-spin ground state with negative
              magnetoanisometry. The major goals of the research are: 1) to identify SMMs
              that operate at higher temperatures, 2) investigate the mechanism of resonant
              magnetism tunneling, 3) clarify the influence of the magnitude of  ground state
              spin, 4) elucidate the influence of isomerism of duodecamanganese complexes, 5)
              investigate the influence of magnetic counterions, 6) prepare half-integer
              ground state SMMs, 7) discover ways to orient SMMs on a surface. An additional
              goal is to determine whether  interconversion of semiquinone complexes of
              cobalt involve quantum mechanical tunneling. During the period of this grant,
              collaborations will be established in order to design and fabricate useful
              microelectronic devices. 

Single molecule magnets (SMMs) are molecular
              nanomagnets. SMMs are widely recognized as having great potential in the
              development of devices useful in ultra-micro electronics.  This field is being
              actively investigated in Japan and Europe. Research produced by this group
              under prior NSF support has set a high standard of quality and productivity.
              This laboratory is ranked as the world's premier center of  research and
              education in magnetochemistry. The science has progressed to the point that
              development of specific useful devices seems feasible.
