Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the work of Dr. John I. Brauman of the Department of Chemistry at
              Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.   The work seeks a fundamental
              understanding of the equilibria, kinetics, and optical and infrared
              photochemistry of ions in the gas phase.    Experimental methods include ion
              cyclotron resonance spectroscopy, high pressure and flowing afterglow mass
              spectrometry, and optical and infrared photoexcitation, using both conventional
              and laser light sources.

The work seeks to understand some of the most
              fundamental issues in organic chemistry, by studying the reactions of reactive
              intermediates in the gas phase using a variety of experimental techniques.  
              Correlating structure with reactivity and comparing gas phase and solution
              phase behavior provides insights into the roles solvents play in influencing
              the outcomes of chemical reactions.   The work is expected to provide excellent
              training for graduate students in both teaching and research.
