Abstract    :
              Political scientists have long attempted to measure and describe the modest and
              contingent effects of party on the behavior of members of Congress and on
              policy choices.  They have done so without specifying models that reflect the
              multiple ways in which parties might influence choice.  In this investigation,
              the researchers: 1) directly model alternative forms of party effects; 2)
              extend the analysis for the entire post-Civil War period in order to encompass
              the various rules and partisan regimes that might be associated with different
              forms of party influence; 3) compare preference and party effects in different
              institutional contests (House and Senate); and, 5) compare preference and party
              effects in "must pass legislation" and in bills where a sizable contingent
              prefers the reversion point.
