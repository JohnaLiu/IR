Abstract    :
              This award to Pennsylvania State University is a renewal of an earlier one, and
              is supported by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the Chemistry
              Division and the Solid State Chemistry Program in the Materials Research
              Division.  In this project, Thomas Mallouk will study a solution-based
              formation of bonded perovskite thin films and nanocrystalline tubes by
              layer-by-layer growth and exfoliation at different reaction conditions. 
              Topochemical dehydration and reduction reactions of the lamellar solids will be
              used to prepare three-dimensional bonded perovskites with three-dimensional
              epitaxial ordering.  These supermolecular assemblies from transition metal
              oxides will be evaluated for ionic, electronic, colossal magnetoresistance and
              ferroelectric properties.  The research program will also provide education and
              training opportunity in materials chemistry to students.

Under the award,
              three-dimensional thins films and nanotubes with defined size, shape and
              composition will be prepared from metal oxides for potential applications in
              molecular electronics, nanoscale machines and related applications. Synthesis
              of these supermolecular assemblies using wet chemistry methods, once fully
              developed, may provide alternate cost-effective methods to the traditional
              procedures such as chemical vapor deposition and laser ablation. In addition,
              the research program will provide education and training opportunity in
              materials chemistry to students.
