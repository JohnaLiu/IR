Abstract    :
              This grant supports a continuing collaboration between atmospheric scientists at
              the University of Wyoming and electrical engineers at the University of
              Massachusetts Amherst in the development and improvement of a 95 GHz (3.2 mm
              wavelength) radar and its application to studies of clouds and precipitation. 
              The radar is ordinarily used in the Wyoming King Air research aircraft.  Unlike
              ordinary weather radars, its short wavelength gives increased sensitivity to
              small drops and enables the radar to detect nonprecipitating clouds.  Called
              the Wyoming Cloud Radar, it is capable of Doppler and polarimetric
              measurements.  It will be mounted temporarily in the NCAR C-130 research
              aircraft for the DYCOMS-II project in July 2001 (Dynamics and Chemistry of
              Marine Stratocumulus).  The data will give details on the cloud structure at
              the mixing region near cloud top and will also indicate the presence of
              drizzle, which is believed to have an important effect on the dynamics of the
              marine boundary layer.  The capabilities of the WCR will be expanded by the
              addition of a second antenna in the King Air, which will permit dual-beam
              transmission for fine-scale observations of the horizontal wind field in
              convective clouds.  The ideas will be tested in a field program in the High
              Plains (Colorado and Wyoming).  The main research topics to be investigated are
              as follows:

1. Relationships between CCN counts, drop concentration, and
              updraft speed.
2. Horizontal wind field in different kinds of clouds.
3.
              Entrainment in cumulus clouds.
4. Drizzle formation in marine stratus
              clouds.
5. Refinement of an attenuation-based method ("stereorad") for
              estimating cloud water content.

Results are relevant to fundamental cloud
              physics, atmospheric remote sensing, and the parameterization of cloud effects
              in large-scale numerical models.
