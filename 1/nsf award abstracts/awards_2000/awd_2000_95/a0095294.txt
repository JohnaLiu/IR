Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to carry out experiments in a new high-pressure research lab
              at Caltech. The lab is equipped with two multi-anvil presses. Asimow proposes
              to use this equipment to carry out experiments on the solubility of water in
              mantle systems under conditions of less-than-water-saturated ("damp" conditions
              with water 50-500 ppm levels). These are probably realistic for the in situ
              mantle undergoing melting below ridges and hot spots. This is an ambitious
              project and consists of numerous elements. Among these are to determine the
              solubility of H2O in mantle phases olivine, Opx, Cpx, Ga and eclogite phases
              (Cpx, Ga, rutile) and how solubility changes as a function of T, P, and system
              composition, including fO2. Actual melting experiments will be carried out to
              5-6 GPA in order to determine the melt chemistry at small melt fractions and
              small H2O contents. These experiments may be applicable to the mantle's
              low-velocity zone at pressures of ~6 GPA (~200 km depth) The experiments will
              be done by the diamond aggregate technique and include determination of a range
              of mantle solidi under variable water conditions. The proposal is for two years
              and comprises post-doc salary for Jed Mosenfelder and supplies needed to carry
              out the experiments. The PI is aware that two years is not enough time to carry
              out the full program of work proposed- the goals are listed for illustrative
              reasons only.
