Abstract    :
              Embedding Assessments in the FAST Curriculum is a feasibility study on the
              impact of formative student assessment on student performance.  The project
              develops a framework to create a set of formative and summative assessments
              from the FAST middle school science program.  The assessment-embedded unit will
              be evaluated in a small, randomized experiment focusing on both student
              learning and teacher implementation.  If the feasibility study demonstrates
              that the framework and methods impact teaching and learning, a full-scale
              research and development effort to link assessments with curricula will be
              proposed using FAST and other middle school programs.
