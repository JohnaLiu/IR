W. Burghardt, Northwestern University

This is one of
              two identical proposals submitted by Northwestern University and Washington
              University.  A combined experimental and computational study is proposed to
              examine the entangled polymers in a time-dependent inhomogeneous flow generated
              by periodic forcing of a viscoelastic fluid past an axisymmetric stagnation
              point.  This is a collaborative effort between Wesley Burghardt of Northwestern
              University and Bamin Khomami of Washington University with the experimental
              part carried out in the former institution while the computational part in the
              latter institution.  These two investigators have collaborated successfully in
              an earlier study, with NSF support, of steady axisymmetric stagnation flow of
              viscoelastic fluids.  They are proposing to extend their work to time-dependent
              flows in order to test the best molecular rheological models in more complex
              flow situations.
