Abstract    :
              
This project seeks to assess the impact of the major economic events and
              institutional changes during the first half of the twentieth century on the
              economic welfare of black, white, and immigrant workers.  Quantitative analysis
              of the economic progression of black workers from 1910 to 1950 is largely a
              missing chapter in U.S. economic history.  The combination of the World Wars,
              expansions, and the Great Depression offers an opportunity to examine the
              impact of a wide variety of settings on the economic progress of various racial
              and ethnic groups.  The data from the Census and the IPUMS has helped scholars
              make a significant start on our understanding.  However, there are significant
              gaps in our knowledge of the impact of business cycles and specific policies
              that can only be filled with annual data.  The goal of this project is to seek
              out and analyze such data from the reports of the various state labor
              departments.  The funds obtained from the NSF will enable me to travel to
              libraries, collect data from state reports, and enter the data into a
              computer-readable format.   The analysis of this data will help fill the gaps
              in our understanding of the economic history of black, white, and immigrant
              workers during this important and dynamic period of history.
