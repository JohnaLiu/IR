Abstract    :
              Plumb 0095595
This project is aimed at the development of a closed theoretical
              formalism for the analysis and modeling of time-mean flows in the presence of
              eddies. On the assumption of balanced flow, the approach is focused on eddy
              transport of potential vorticity and of tracers. Balance assumptions will allow
              necessary approximations to be made in the divergence (or momentum) budgets in
              order to close the entire system of equations around a single parameterization
              for the transport of potential vorticity and of tracers. It is intended that
              this work will produce not only a scheme for the parameterization of eddy
              transports in global ocean models, but also a set of conceptual tools for the
              analysis of the ocean circulation. Eddy resolving models will be used to guide
              the theoretical development, and to provide testbeds against which to compare
              results from lower resolution models with parameterized eddies.
