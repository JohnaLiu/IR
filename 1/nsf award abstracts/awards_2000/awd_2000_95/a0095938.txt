Abstract    :
              "Constructing Understandings of Earth Systems (CUES)" is a comprehensive
              treatment of the Earth and Space Science Content of the National Science
              Education Standards for middle school students.   The materials address
              fundamental Earth Systems content.  The Earth evolves as a synergistic physical
              system of interrelated phenomena, processes and cycles that may be affected by
              human activities.  To support the integration of subject matter knowledge and
              the nature of science, students engage in guided and student-driven inquiry and
              use CD-ROM or Web-based tools to gather data and promote their explorations
              through photographs and visualizations.  Students are expected to make informed
              decisions about science-based personal and social issues.  The topics covered
              include the stucture of the solar system, cycles within Earth/Space Systems,
              flow of matter and energy  in and on Earth and in ecosystems, plate tectonics
              and its effects, the water cycle and weather, fossils, processes that shape the
              land, change, renewable resources, and resource management and sustainability. 
              The textbook is accompanied by content video, a teacher's guide, professional
              development materials and a website.  The variety of assessments include
              discovering pre-conceptions, embedded assessments, standardized tests,  and
              open-ended questions.
