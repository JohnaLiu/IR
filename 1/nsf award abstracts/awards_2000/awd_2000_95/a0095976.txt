Abstract    :
              The PI will use the funds to double the resolution (3-5 ky) of the Oligocene
              through early Miocene benthic foraminiferal stable isotopic record at the
              subantarctic ODP site 1090 that has yielded an excellent paleomagnetic record.
              This will allow direct calibration of the two sets of data and develop an
              astronomically tuned time scale for the interval. If successful, the site could
              become a type section for chronostratigraphy of this interval.
