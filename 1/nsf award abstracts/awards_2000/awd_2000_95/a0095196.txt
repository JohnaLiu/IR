Abstract    :
              This project represents a collaboration of US and the Kola Science Center
              (Apatity, Russia) investigators for the purpose of examining the impacts of
              reduced environmental stress on the watershed ecology and the value of
              integrated modeling on consensus-building by decision-makers in the region. 
              The investigators will conduct a workshop in Russia to examine the effect of
              decreased industrial and human activity on the ecological health or resilience
              of a watershed on the Kola Peninsula that has been severely affected by
              industrial use.  The researchers will use modeling to assess economic and
              social development of the region and possible scenarios under changing global
              conditions, such as global warming.  The workshop and an initial pilot project
              will be used to examine the value of the models for application to the
              integrated assessment of other watersheds on the Peninsula.
