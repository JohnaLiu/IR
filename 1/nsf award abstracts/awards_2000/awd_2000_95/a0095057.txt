Abstract    :
              0095057/Curry

In the late 1980s and early 1990s the source of Labrador Sea
              Water (LSW) 
became colder, fresher and denser during a persistent high phase
              of the 
North Atlantic Oscillation.  This provided an anomalous signature
              which 
could be used to track deep water as it flows south in the Deep Western
              
Boundary Current (DWBC) of the North Atlantic.  This project will 
analyze
              data collected from a series of sections across the deep western 
boundary
              current in and near the tropical Atlantic, including some that 
were recently
              made under a Small Grant for Exploratory Research.  One 
aim is to determine
              the speed with which the anomalous LSW signal is 
traveling along the western
              boundary of the North Atlantic.  This will 
provide an estimate of how rapidly
              climate signals associated with 
adjustments in the ocean's meridional
              overturning circulation can 
propagate from high to low latitudes.  This is an
              important parameter 
in many scenarios of climate change and one that can be
              used to test 
the fidelity of climate models.  A second aim is to determine
              the 
dynamical effects on the DWBC of the passage of this anomalously low
              
potential vorticity.
