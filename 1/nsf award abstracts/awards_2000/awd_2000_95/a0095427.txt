Abstract    :
              Cenedese - 0095427

The role of geostrophic eddies in setting the
              stratification and meridional transport of a circumpolar current will be
              explored through experiments in an unique laboratory configuration.  Buoyancy
              flux and mechanical mixing will be allowed to act simultaneously to develop a
              thermocline and eddies.  Preliminary efforts are complete.  The portion of
              buoyancy flux/'stress' parameter space to be investigated includes the
              Antarctic Circumpolar Current characteristics.  Later studies will include a
              'cape' to model the effects of Drake Passage and a sloping lid in an effort to
              model beta plane effects.
