Abstract    :
              This proposal suggests a new fast learning, on line method for the prediction of
              power
system transient instability and an example of its application to a
              single machine and
infinite bus. The proposed algorithm is adapted from a
              proven robotic ball-catching
algorithm, which includes fast learning. For
              instability prediction, the ball location is
replaced by the measured relative
              generator rotor angle. Using the measured relative rotor
angle, the control
              algorithm predicts the rotor angle at a future time. The relative rotor
angle
              is sampled at a rate of 600 times per second. This new fast learning algorithm
              will
predict the rotor angle 500-1000 milliseconds into the future. The
              increase of the
predicted generator relative rotor angle beyond a
              predetermined threshold is a prediction
that loss of synchronism will occur.
              When loss of synchronism is predicted a protection
scheme can initiate a
              stability aid such as generator tripping, braking resistor and/or
              fast
valving.

Preliminary investigation shows that the ball-catching
              algorithm may be applied for
transient stability prediction. This proposal
              requests funding to prove the feasibility of
this method.
