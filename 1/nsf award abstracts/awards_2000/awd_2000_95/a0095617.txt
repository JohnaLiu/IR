Abstract    :
              Summary:  This objective of this study is to refine and test bioproductivity
              variation over the last 140,000 years in the eastern equatorial Pacific.  Focus
              will be on analyzing cores in the Panama Basin and along the east Pacific rise,
              to the west and south of cores for which we already have data.
