Abstract    :
              Andreas Albrecht has support from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to
              continue his studies on nonlinear vibronic and electronic spectroscopy of
              molecules in the condensed phase.  He will use theoretical and experimental
              methods to investigate nonlinear measurements of chirality.  The systems are in
              isotropic media and measurements are at the electric dipole level. 
              Specifically he will study fifth order odd-wave mixing as an ultrafast optical
              analog to 2D NMR.  

Chiral systems are central in chemistry and physics. 
              These studies will yield information about systems that support chirality that
              is otherwise non-attainable.  Especially noteworthy is the fact that these
              methods will have the time resolution required to resolve biological dynamics. 
              Due to the applications to biologically-interesting molecules in solution, 
              these studies will have a significant impact in areas well beyond chemistry or
              chemical physics.
