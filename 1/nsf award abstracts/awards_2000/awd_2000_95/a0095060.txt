Abstract    :
              Spall - 0095060

A series of numerical model experiments will investigate the
              cause of intense recirculation gyres observed along the boundaries of the
              Irminger and Labrador Seas, their structure, and their influence on the
              formation and export of Labrador Sea Water.  Labrador Sea Water is an important
              component of the decadal scale variability of the oceans.  The MIT Circulation
              Model will be used in a hydrostatic configuration with partial cell resolution
              in the vertical.  Initial, small-scale studies will use idealized topography
              with wind and buoyancy forcing.  Grid size will be small enough to allow
              development of eddies.  Later, regional scale modeling will allow incorporation
              of large-scale circulation patterns and more realistic topography.  Results of
              these studies will be compared with field observations.
