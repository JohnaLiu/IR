Abstract    :
              The PIs will measure trace elements (Ba, U, Mo, Mn, and Ge) in Jahnke's existing
              benthic flux chamber samples dating back to 1997. The goal is to establish
              bottom boundary conditions governing the regeneration and burial of several
              tracers used to interpret past ocean chemistry, circulation, productivity,
              carbon flux and redox conditions. Existing sites include a wide variety of
              oceanic environments. The samples will be screened with low-precision ICP-MS
              methods and subsets of selected samples will be analyzed with high-precision
              ID-ICP-MS. Selected pore water samples will also be screened and analyzed.
              These data will
be used to understand processes controlling transfer across
              the sediment-water interface and quantitative relationships with other
              parameters.
