Abstract    :
              While mid-ocean ridge basalts provide wide-spread samples of the oceanic upper
              mantle and the chemistry of these rocks potentially constrains mantle
              temperature and composition, interpreting these constraints requires inversion
              using petrogenetic models that specify mangle mineralogy, temperature,
              geochemistry, and dynamics.  Oxygen-isotope variations in these basalts have
              the potential to add important new constraints because oxygen-isotope
              composition of subducted oceanic crust differs from that of common mantle
              peridotites such that subduction of crust into the uppermantle can create
              domains that are both compositionally compositionally enriched in basaltic and
              sedimentary components and anomalous in delta 018.  Detailed sutdies of suites
              selected to examine the influence of crystallization-differentiation, crustl
              assimilation, and sub-solidus alteration on the delta 018 of mid-ocean ridge
              basalts.
