Abstract    :
              This research project concerns how time is valued in social interaction. Our
              approach is based on three premises:  

(1) We argue that emotion is critical
              to temporal evaluation in social contexts.  As research shows, people often get
              anxious in response to time compression, and people often experience anger in
              response to delays.   
(2) We argue that people place a value on the
              experience of flow and momentum across events -- people have pacing goals in
              social interaction.   
(3) We posit that people innately value feeling
              "in-pace" with others -- they have an "in-synch" preference.  The degree to
              which this preference is met in interaction affects cognitive and emotional
              processing, as well as the actual outcomes and relationships that emerge
              through interaction.   

Thus, in our research, we predict that when feeling
              in-synch (that is, when people have the same pacing goals), people will
              experience the highest levels of satisfaction and function most effectively in
              interaction.  When feeling out-of-synch, negative emotions will be triggered,
              cognitive functioning will falter, and diminished joint performance will be
              observed. We have designed four series of studies to test these propositions.
              When our research is complete, it will offer new insights (a) into how time is
              valued among social actors and (b) about group and organizational dynamics
              during times of turbulence and change.
