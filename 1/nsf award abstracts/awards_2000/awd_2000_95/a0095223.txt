              ABSTRACT

OCE-0095223 and OCE-0095090

The process of dissolved organic
              matter (DOM) transport toward export regions has been inferred mostly from a 
              few sections showing surface accumulation of enhanced dissolved organic carbon
              (DOC) concentration and penetration to  depth.  Decomposition during flow from
              source regions to export sites has not been studied, nor  has the accompanying
              transport of dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus (DON and DOP).   In this
              project, researchers at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and the
              Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences will observe the transport
              of accumulated DOC, DON and DOP during the  spring phytoplankton bloom in the
              NE Atlantic Ocean, the region previously studied in the  JGOFS North Atlantic
              Bloom Experiment.  They will track the transport and simultaneous 
              decomposition of both the overwintering and newly-produced DOM as it flows
              through the NE  Atlantic toward a site of bottom water formation to the
              northeast of the U.K. in the Norwegian  Sea. This project will take advantage
              of an opportunity to participate on a detailed hydrographic survey of the  NE
              Atlantic in spring 2001 aboard the U.K. research vessel RRS CHARLES DARWIN 
              with colleagues from the George Deacon Division of the Southampton Oceanography
              Centre  (SOC), U.K. A principal cruise objective is to calculate volume
              transports, from which mass  transport of DOM can be estimated.   
While the
              broad outlines of these processes have now been sketched in, there have been 
              no detailed studies in which DOM transport has been explicitly studied in the
              relevant  hydrographic framework, and none in which simultaneous estimates of
              underway decomposition  have been determined. This study, a collaboration among
              biogeochemists,  microbial ecologists, and physical oceanographers would be the
              first  to provide synoptic data on DOC, DON and DOP concentrations, volume
              transports and decomposition rates, from which mass transport of DOM components
              can be assessed.
