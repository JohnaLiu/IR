Abstract    :
              This study will examine the social organization and social processes of opium
              cultivation, heroin production, drug use, and drug distribution within an area
              of the Golden Triangle, which consists of the area where the borders of Burma
              (Myanmar), Thailand, and Laos meet. In particular, the project will examine the
              history, culture, and political economy of the Wa area and explore the factors
              that have caused it to become a major opium-growing area. The project will
              explore the key players on the supply side of the drug trade and the dynamics
              of supply, organizational patterns of the global heroin trade (i.e.,
              hierarchical structure or adaptive networks), and the social and political
              conditions that foster the drug trade.  Data will be collected through
              extensive fieldwork in a major opium-producing area, the Wa territory of Burma,
              plus face--to-face interviews with opium growers, opium/heroin traders, and
              opium/heroin users. Other subjects to be interviewed include Wa soldiers and
              officers, Wa leaders, and Asian and U.S. law enforcement authorities. Findings
              from this study will inform the public, as well as government and drug
              enforcement officials, on little-known aspects of the drug trade in the Golden
              Triangle and help policymakers to develop more effective measures to reduce the
              production of opium and the refining and trafficking of heroin.
