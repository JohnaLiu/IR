Abstract    :
              This objective of this study is to more carefully constrain the timing of the
              shift in sulfur isotope ratio during the late Paleocene and determine the
              relationship of that shift to changes in carbon and oxygen isotopes.  The study
              will also establish the relationship of the sulfur isotope shift to variations
              in Sr/Ca ratio in barite and phosphorous content of bulk sediment.
