Abstract    :
              To date, virtually all analyses of an international nature have relied on data
              deriving from national or political boundaries. This research project will
              develop and analyze economic data on a geophysical (latitude and longitude)
              basis. By developing data on a geophysically gridded basis, it will be possible
              to  promote insight and understanding into the relationship between
              socioeconomic
data and geophysical data.

The central task of the research
              will be to develop a global, geophysically scaled data set on economic output.
              This data set is called the Geophysically Scaled Economic Data Set (GSEDS). The
              GSEDS will be a gridded data set a 1 degree latitude by 1 degre longitude
              resolution. This scale is approximately 100 by 100 km, which is somewhat
              smaller  than the size of the major subnational political entities for most
              large countries. The economic activity concept will be gross value added (gross
              regional product) measured both at market exchange rates, and at
              purchasing-power parity exchange rates. 

The utility of the GSEDS will be to
              open up a wide range of research that is currently not possible with existing
              data. By linking economic and geophysical data, it will be possible to examine
              the environmental impacts of economic activity as well as the economic
              dimensions of geography and geophysical phenomena.
