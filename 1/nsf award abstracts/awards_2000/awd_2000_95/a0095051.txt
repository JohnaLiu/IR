This U.S.-Hungarian research involves Jorge
              Dubcovsky of the University of California, Davis, and Gabor Galiba of the
              Hungarian Agricultural Research Institute, Martonvasar, and features the
              isolation and characterization of genes affecting frost tolerance in wheat. 
              The researchers will combine the genetic models and tools for diploid wheat,
              Triticum monococcum, developed at Davis with the characterization procedures
              for frost tolerance and vernalization developed at Martonvasar.  Their goal is
              to determine how to cone the genes responsible for frost tolerance in
              wheat.

Using a combination of positional cloning and differential display
              approaches, their joint research plan includes: 1) construction of a detailed
              chromosomal map for a new found gene affecting frost tolerance in wheat,
              Fr-Am2, on the chromosome 5AmL of T. monococcum; 2) mapping the regulatory loci
              of winter hardiness, cor14b, a cold-inducible expression on T. monococcum; and
              3) mapping the stress induced genes, identified by differential display and
              deletion and substitution of chromosome 5A in hexaploid wheat.  Successfully
              identified cDNA clones will be incorporated into T. monococcum
              maps.

Molecular markers tightly linked to the frost tolerance genes will be
              used to screen the Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) library of T.
              monococcum to characterize the complete genes and their regulatory elements. 
              Results are expected to relate controlling loci to inducible genes.  If
              successful, the new information may contribute to our basic understanding of
              the physiological and biochemical bases for freeze tolerance, which is an
              agriculturally important plant trait. 

This international project in plant
              genome research fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific
              knowledge by enabling experts in the Untied States and Central Europe to
              combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong
              mutual interest and competence.
