Abstract    :
              Empirical work on pay for performance shows little support for the available
              theories. This proposal reasons why this is so. First, agency theory predicts
              that pay for performance should be less common in uncertain environments.
              However, the data do not seem to support this assertion. I argue that when
              workers operate in certain settings, the activities that they should engage in
              are well known, and firms are content to assign tasks to workers and monitor
              their inputs. By contrast, when the situation is more uncertain, firms know
              less about how workers should be spending their time. As a result, they
              delegate responsibility to workers but, to constrain their discretion, base
              compensation on observed output. Second, agency theory has had little to say
              about the control of bureaucratic corruption. I argue that standard means of
              relating pay to bureaucratic performance are unlikely to be successful and that
              instead, oversight occurs through independent investigations.  This project
              outlines a series of behavioral responses to the use of investigations that
              limit the use of incentives for bureaucrats.
