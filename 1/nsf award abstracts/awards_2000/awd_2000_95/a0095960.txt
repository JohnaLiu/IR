              ABSTRACT

OCE-0095960


The focus of the proposed measurements is to better
              constrain temporal changes in passive tracer chloroflurocarbons (CFCs) and
              anthropogenic CO2 penetration into the complex water mass transformations
              undergone by surface and near-surface waters regions of the Southern Ocean. 
              The rate at which the Southern Ocean takes up anthropogenic CO2 is of broad
              interest to the global carbon inventory and future climate change. Current
              global ocean 3D general circulation models (OGCMs) do not compare well in the
              Southern Ocean and often suggest higher CO2 inventories  than observations
              allow. Investigators form the University of Washington will join scheduled
              hydrographic cruises to be undertaken by Australian researchers (CSIRO- Marine
              Research, Hobart) on two Southern Ocean sections, and will specifically measure
              chloroflurocarbons (CFC's) and ocean carbon system parameters (TCO2, TA).  Data
              analysis of the CFC numbers will be aimed at assessing recent changes in
              surface ventilation rates in known water masses.  Temporal changes in CO2 will
              be analysed using the quasi-conservative tracer DC* approach.
