Abstract    :
              This project examines whether prosecution of misdemeanor domestic violence,
              accompanied by counseling and advocacy services for its victims, has a greater
              deterrent effect on recidivism than prosecution alone. Several hypotheses will
              be tested, the most critical of which is whether there is a subsequent decrease
              in intimate violence and an increase in self esteem, empowerment, and quality
              of life when victims receive counseling and advocacy services from Kings County
              (New York) District Attorney's Office social workers following a domestic
              violence incident and throughout the criminal case. More specifically, the
              project will compare victims residing in one geographic area, who receive a
              "Prosecutor Plus Counseling and Advocacy" condition, with closely matched
              victims in a second area who receive a "Prosecutor Only" condition. The
              subjects will be evaluated immediately following the perpetrator's arrest and
              at 3-month intervals throughout the duration of the criminal case and following
              its resolution for a total of 12 months. The study provides a unique
              opportunity to conduct a field experiment in Brooklyn's predominantly
              African-American and Caribbean community to evaluate the effectiveness of
              counseling and advocacy services in reducing domestic violence recidivism.
