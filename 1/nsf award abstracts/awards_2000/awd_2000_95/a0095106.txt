              ABSTRACT

OCE-0095106

In this project, investigators at the University of
              Washington will quantify the physical mechanisms controlling the rates  of
              biological carbon export and the uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2)
              in the North Pacific Ocean using a basin-wide general circulation model (GCM).
              The proposed model is operational and has already been used to evaluate 
              mechanisms of subduction and water mass formation in the North Pacific and is
              currently being tested using chlorofluorocarbon tracers (CFCs).

The approach
              will be first to incorporate bomb-produced 14C into the model to validate its
              advective  and diffusive fields. By adding this carbon-based tracer the model
              will then have been verified with both CFCs and  14C -- two tracers with
              different boundary conditions and time  histories. Next, the three-dimensional
              distribution of biological carbon export and  remineralization rates will be
              determined by using the observed distributions of several  biological
              productivity tracers, specifically nitrate and phosphate (and their dissolved
              organic counterparts DON and DOP), three dissolved atmospheric gases (oxygen,
              argon, and nitrogen), and the  13C/12C ratio of the dissolved inorganic carbon 
              (DIC).  The PIs would then simulate the anthropogenic CO2 perturbation and
              utilize  independent reconstructions of the anthropogenic DIC and 13C/12C
              changes in the North  Pacific to validate model predictions. Finally, the model
              response  to decadal variability in forcing would be examined.

There are
              several important reasons to choose the North Pacific Ocean as the site for a
              basin-scale modeling study. There are three JGOFS time-series sites that yield
              observed carbon fluxes and anthropogenic CO2 signals to compare to model
              predictions. The lack of deep-water formation at its poleward boundary
              simplifies the meridional circulation compared to the North Atlantic and
              southern oceans and justifies shorter model runs. Finally, the North Pacific
              has been the site of intensive chemical tracer measurements, specifically CFCs,
               14C and  13C/12C, over the last 10 years.  

The investigators will focus
              their modeling efforts on quantifying physical processes that likely  control
              tracer, nutrient and CO2 fluxes in the upper ocean: 1) equatorial-subtropical
              and subtropical-subpolar exchange, 2) thermocline ventilation and isopycnal
              transport both with and without eddies, and 3) diapycnal mixing and the
              influence of eddies in the upper thermocline, and 4) the impact of decadal
              variability on biological carbon export.
