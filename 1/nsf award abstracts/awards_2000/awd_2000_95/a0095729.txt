Abstract    :
              Award Abstract
Sellers often have or may acquire proprietary information about
              the value of the object to
be sold. A conventional wisdom from auction theory
              is that a seller at auction will increase
revenues on average by adopting a
              policy of always revealing all her available information
about the object's
              value.
Our project demonstrates that a seller will often do better by
              revealing no information.
More generally, a policy of partial information
              revelation is better than both no revelation
and full revelation.
Full
              revelation policies unambiguously enhance revenue only under special
              circumstances.
Despite this limitation, full revelation has been routinely
              advocated and adopted by sellers.
For instance, a full revelation policy was
              adopted by the FCC in its design of spectrum
auctions. Similar policies were
              subsequently implemented by other nations selling spectrum
rights. We
              demonstrate that quite generally the seller can increase her expected revenue
              by
carefully crafting a policy that conceals part of her information. We
              describe a procedure
for crafting such a policy.
