The Government-University-Industry Research Roundtable
              (GUIRR), established in 1984, provides a unique forum for dialogue among top
              government, university and industry leaders of the national science and
              technology enterprise.  GUIRR is sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences
              and is guided by a Council that develops the Roundtable agenda and oversees
              plans and activities of various Working Groups appointed to examine additional
              topics in depth.  In recent years the Roundtable has sponsored numerous
              projects such as Removing Barriers to Industry-University Research
              Collaboration and Stresses on Research and Education at Colleges and
              Universities.  GUIRR is the convenor of the Federal Demonstration Partnership
              (FDP). The FDP, through meetings and issuance of reports, serves as an ongoing
              cooperative effort among sixty-five universities or research institutes and
              eleven Federal Agencies to address means to improve management of federally
              funded research.  Primary core support is received by each of the major federal
              research and development agencies.  In 1993, GUIRR created an affiliated
              University-Industry Partnership program as a supplemental component of its
              funding.
