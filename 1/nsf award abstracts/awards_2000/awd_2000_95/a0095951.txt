Abstract    :
              This project will develop and test a field deployable Laser-Induced Fluorescence
              (LIF) formaldehyde (HCHO) detection sensor to be used in both airborne and
              ground-based tropospheric measurements.  The sensor has the potential to
              significantly improve the detection limits for formaldehyde in the atmosphere. 
              Improved measurements of HCHO will be helpful in understanding ozone production
              and in designing control strategies that will have broad applications to air
              pollution problems in many areas.
