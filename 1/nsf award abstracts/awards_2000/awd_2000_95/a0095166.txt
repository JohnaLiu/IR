A thermodynamical model of defects in crystalline solids
              which includes a novel field induced defect property tensor accounts for the
              known variation of the excess magnetostriction in Fe-Al and Fe-Ga alloys.
              Specifically, the model suggests that next nearest neighbor substitutional-
              substitutional pairs of tetragonal symmetry are responsible for the effect. The
              studies are directed to determine the model parameters self-consistently
              through measurements of the relaxed and unrelaxed magnetostrictive, elastic and
              magnetic anisotropy constants as well as lattice constants. In an effort to
              generalize the model the studies will be extended to Fe-C-Al and Fe-C-Ga and
              possibly additional alloys containing defect pairs of tetragonal symmetry. The
              studies will lead to a basic understanding of the significant magnetostriction
              in body-centered iron-base alloys. They will at minimum systematize the excess
              magnetostriction and maximally establish criteria for the development of novel
              alloys with a significant magnetostriction. 
%%%
Materials with a
              magnetostriction as large as .000200 are of significant technological interest.
              The studies will identify the nature of the magnetostriction in body centered
              cubic iron base alloys and establish criteria for the search of additional
              magnetostrictive alloys.
