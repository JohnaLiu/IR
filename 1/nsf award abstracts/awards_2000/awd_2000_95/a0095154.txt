Abstract    :
              This research would investigate the correspondence between change in the Central
              Yup'ik culture of southwestern Alaska and woven basket design, composition, and
              style.  Over the last century, this culture has been dramatically impacted by
              association with western culture.  The extent to which cultural impact alters
              basic life patterns will be investigated in this research.  One of the
              prominent cultural activities of this group has been the production of woven
              baskets, and several museums have collections covering the last 100 years.  The
              project will examine, categorize, and statistically analyze the design,
              construction and style of woven baskets collected over this time period.  The
              investigator will conduct in-depth interviews with basket makers to develop
              data on the linkage between basket making and cultural change.  As few written
              records document cultural change in this ethnic group, this work may lead to
              insight into cultural adaptation in response to changing and prominent western
              influences.
