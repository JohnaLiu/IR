This project focuses on a fundamental study of aluminum
              bimetallic clusters, transition metal carbide clusters, and gallium, indium and
              thallium clusters in the gas phase using photodetachment spectroscopy and
              theoretical calculations, and on the use of these clusters as building block
              materials for the synthesis and characterization of solid state nanometerials.
              The work will describe the electronic structure and chemical bonding of
              clusters in a search for structurally or electronically stable ones that can be
              used in the synthesis of nanomaterials, and ultimately to be able to connect
              molecular properties with bulk properties.

The goal of developing
              protocols for the design, synthesis, and engineering of novel nanomaterials a
              priori with predicted and tailored properties is an area of significant 
              interest to the commercial sector. The nanomaterials to be studied in this
              project will be of high interest to the aerospace and electronics industries,
              and students trained in these areas are likely to compete very effectively in
              the job market.
