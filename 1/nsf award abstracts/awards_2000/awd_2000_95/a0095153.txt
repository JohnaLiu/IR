Abstract    :
              The use of gravitational waves to study the universe is entering a new stage, as
              LIGO, VIRGO, and GEO will soon begin their first scientific data runs.  This
              meeting will bring researchers from the gravitational wave, astronomy,
              astrophysics, and numerical relativity communities together to communicate to
              each other where things stand, in particular the capabilities of the
              instruments involved, and what directions are being proposed.  It will provide
              a forum to generate new strategies, collaborations, and directions.
