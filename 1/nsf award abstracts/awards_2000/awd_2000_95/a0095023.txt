Abstract    :
              This project consists of a three-step strategy for supporting collaboration
              among diverse research communities with the goals of encouraging the
              research-based analysis of molecular visualization and defining the role of
              molecular visualization in the teaching of chemistry . An invitational workshop
              on molecular visualization in the teaching of chemistry will provide a forum
              for lead chemists, cognitive scientists, and chemical educators to define
              directions for new research and development in this field, in particular with
              respect to modes of interaction with visualizations of molecular structure and
              dynamics. The project also provides travel support for 20 teachers, school
              administrators, college and university faculty, and graduate students attending
              the Gordon Research Conference on Science Education and Visualization:
              International, August 5-10, 2001. In order to encourage continuing
              collaboration among In order to continue emerging collaborations that form at
              the 2001 Gordon Research Conference on Science Education and Visualization,
              participants will be invited to apply for five minigrants of $5,000 each to
              continue interdisciplinary collaborations formed to conduct research or
              development work in molecular visualization in science education.
