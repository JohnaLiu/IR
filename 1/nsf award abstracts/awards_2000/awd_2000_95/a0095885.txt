Abstract    :
              This proposal addressees fundamental questions related to the origin of the
              earth's mantle and atmosphere, the history of mantle flow and present mantle
              processes, and the nature of mantle melting and the interaction of mantle
              plumes with ambient mantle. More specifically, the goals of the proposal are to
              understand the processes of mixing and mantle flow that accompany the
              interaction of a mantle plume with the normal mantle below mid-ocean ridges.
              The approach of this proposal is to look at volatile abundances and isotope
              ratios, especially H, He, Ne, Ar, and CO2 and H2O. Well-characterized dredged
              samples are available from UK investigators for the Reykjanes Ridge between 57
              and 63 degrees north. Preliminary 3He/4He and He abundance data show that
              degassing is an important process north of  61 degrees, where shoaling eruption
              depth results in extensive degassing and low He abundances. There are five
              individual hypotheses that can be tested with the data to be collected, most
              having to do with the intrinsic processes that happen in combination with
              apparent 2-component mixing of plume and MORB mantle seen with other
              components. The noble gas data will be collected by crushing, stepped
              combustion and with a laser probe, a new and promising method.
