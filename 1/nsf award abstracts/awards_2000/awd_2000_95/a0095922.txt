Abstract    :
              This proposal is for the creation of two units of instruction in technology
              education, yielding ten modules for the fifth and sixth grades.  The units are
              titled "Design and Innovation, and Technology Systems," and would seek to
              interpret the recently published standards for technological literacy.  Modules
              include:  Communication--Better ideas in history; Power and Energy--Circuits in
              a city; Manufacturing--Keeping food fresh; Transportation--People and goods in
              motion; Health--Fighting disease in the air; Ecosystem--Energy from the sun;
              Construction--Keeping the heat in and out; Innovation--people making things
              better; Invention--Creating the new thing; and Environment--Changing waste. 
              Units will be piloted and field-tested in eight states by exemplary teachers.
