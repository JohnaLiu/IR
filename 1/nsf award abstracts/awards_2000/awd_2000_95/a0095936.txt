Abstract    :
              The goal of this experimental study is to understand  the relation between
              deformation and melt migration in partially molten rocks and to find out how
              melt actually moves as a function of  varying temperature, stress, lithostatic
              pressure, magma pressure, strain rate, and time. Partly molten rocks will be
              tested in hydrostatic melt extraction experiments under conditions of varying
              pressure, with one or two solid phases, and with melt of variable amount and
              viscosity, which will result in significant differences in permeability in
              different experiments. Triaxial deformation experiments will also be carried
              out at variable temperatures, melt percents,  and strain rates. Samples will be
              carefully examined before and after the experiments to evaluate physical
              properties. Permeabilities will be measured directly in some of the
              experiments. Results will be evaluated in light of previous experiments and
              theoretical considerations.
