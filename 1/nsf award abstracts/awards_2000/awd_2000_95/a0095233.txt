Abstract    :
              The proliferation of Application Service Providers (ASPs) and software developed
              through the Open Source Software (OSS) approach offer enormous potential to
              non-profit, community-serving organizations. OSS could allow these
              organizations to share their limited software development resources while ASPs
              could allow for more reliable, lower cost and sustainable information
              technology infrastructures to be developed and shared by them. Together, they
              offer important synergies in increasing the effectiveness of community-serving
              organizations. However, the barriers to sustainable infrastructure are
              particularly acute in smaller non-profit organizations due to their limited
              financial and technical resources. Further, generating the requirements for
              shared systems is difficult. The PI and graduate students will engage in
              preliminary field studies with agencies delivering social services to the
              elderly in Detroit. These agencies are considering the use of ASPs and OSS
              applications and need to develop requirements. Aside from the direct and
              practical impacts this research may have on those agencies, new, generalizable
              approaches will be developed for requirements generation for information
              infrastructures for community-serving organizations.
