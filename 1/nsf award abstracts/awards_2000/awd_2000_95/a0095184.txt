Abstract    :
              This project is designed to recruit talented students with limited financial
              resources, to offer support and programs to help these students complete their
              degrees in a timely manner, and to encourage the students to continue to
              employment or a higher degree. The goals and objectives which extend quality
              programming and support services include (a) an aggressive recruitment of women
              and minority students, (b) a comprehensive system of orientation, and (c)
              internships, mentoring, and job placement programs. A cluster approach to
              scheduling promotes small group and peer interaction. To enhance the
              educational experience, students are attending professional seminars in their
              program area. A special arrangement with the New Jersey Institute of Technology
              provides students with a smooth transition to baccalaureate studies. The added
              dimensions of academic support and work experience promise to produce students
              who can also easily transition from college to the workplace.
