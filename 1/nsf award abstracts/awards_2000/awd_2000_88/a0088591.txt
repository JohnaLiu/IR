Abstract    :
              Engineering - Mechanical (56) 


This project aims to dramatically improve
              the ability of engineering students to solve practical problems by adapting the
              Professional Decision Making (PDM) process developed by Charlie Wales and his
              colleagues. The PDM process was taught to freshman and when these students were
              compared to a control group, the PDM-trained students showed an increase in GPA
              of 25% and an increase in graduation rate of 32%, suggesting the PDM process is
              very effective.

We are adapting and implementing the PDM process in
              engineering science courses and in five design courses that span our
              curriculum, simultaneously adapting and implementing pedagogical methods from
              the education community. To facilitate the implementation, we are developing
              curriculum materials on both the PDM process and on appropriate pedagogy
              delivered using the web. To facilitate best-practice pedagogy, our team
              includes a master educator from the college of education. This project is
              providing knowledge of (1) the value of teaching a global problem solving
              method across a curriculum, (2) pedagogy for teaching problem solving to
              diverse and developing learners, (3) methods for facilitating teaching of a
              common problem solving approach, and (4) methods for vertically integrating a
              curriculum.
