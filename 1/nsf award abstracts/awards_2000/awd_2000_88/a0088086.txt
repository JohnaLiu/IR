Combined
              Research-Curriculum Development in Computer Vision

This project integrates
              recent and ongoing research in computer vision into this institution's computer
              science and engineering curriculum. There are several objectives for this
              project. One is the design, implementation, and testing of innovative
              approaches for integrating teaching with research, leading to a comprehensive
              instructional program offering systematic and constant research experiences to
              as many students as possible. To this end, students are included in summer
              research programs involving computer vision.  Another objective of the project
              is the integration of computer vision principles into several core courses and
              the introduction of a new course in mathematical methods for computer vision to
              support the integration of vision research into core courses.  The final
              objective is the development of a new course in object recognition that
              includes current research advances and evolving principles of object
              recognition. The evaluation of the success of educational techniques and the
              dissemination of the results of this activity are critical elements of the
              project.
