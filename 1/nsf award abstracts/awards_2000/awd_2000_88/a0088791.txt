This award has allowed the acquisition of a Fourier Transform
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer (FT- NMR) and its incorporation into
              courses across our entire curriculum. This instrument is significantly
              enhancing student laboratory experiences, incorporating modern technology into
              the classroom, and expanding course offerings. Experiments adapted from the
              research and educational literature and implemented into our curriculum are
              focusing on the multinuclear capabilities of the instrument, the ability to
              record 2-dimensional spectra, and the ability to do quantitative analysis
              through line-broadening experiments. Curricular changes are evolving as the NMR
              is incorporated into a new spectroscopy course, merged from a portion of three
              (currently ) separate courses, and it is becomes essential for the development
              of modular, Special Topics courses and new integrated laboratories. Students at
              all levels are readily obtaining their own spectra and thus are gaining
              valuable, hands-on experience with an instrument that has wide applicability in
              a modern research and/or quality control laboratory.
