Abstract    :
               Biological Sciences (61) The explosive growth of biological sequence
              information has created a demand for individuals skilled in retrieving,
              managing, and analyzing scientific data. According to the NIH, "Researchers who
              five years ago spent little time on computers report that they now spend 90% of
              their research time in front of their monitors"(1). Although the need for
              biologists with computer skills has increased dramatically, the number of
              undergraduates learning these skills has not. Few students learn how to use
              computers as a research tool. Biology teaching has lagged behind, largely,
              through the lack of "classroom-ready" materials available to college and high
              school instructors. Through this project, computer-based laboratory experiments
              are being created in collaboration with the National Center for Biotechnology
              Information (NCBI). Prototype instructional materials are being developed to
              teach students how to use NCBI's databases and bioinformatics tools to perform
              novel experiments while emphasizing fundamental concepts in biology. It is
              anticipated that students that use bioinformatics as a tool for inquiry-based
              research will have a better understanding of modern biology and new research
              skills. Laboratory exercises are being formally evaluated and tested by faculty
              from community colleges, four-year institutions, and high schools.
