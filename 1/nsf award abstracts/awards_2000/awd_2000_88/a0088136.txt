This award, provided by the Antarctic Geology and
              Geophysics Program of the Office of Polar Programs, supports a project to study
              eolian processes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. This research project will use the
              unique natural laboratory provided by the McMurdo Dry Valleys to study
              fundamental processes associated with airflow and sediment transport by wind on
              rough surfaces. The research will quantify the partitioning of wind shear
              stress between roughness elements (in this case, boulders) and the intervening
              surface using novel instrumentation (Irwin Sensors) recently developed and
              tested in field and laboratory wind tunnel experiments. The field data will be
              used to test existing models of shear stress partitioning and to develop new
              empirical models for relations between winds, surface roughness element
              distribution and geometry, and sediment transport rates. The research will
              extend on-going studies of these relations on sparsely vegetated surfaces to
              unvegetated rough surfaces, such those found in arid terrains on Earth and
              Mars. This work will provide fundamental data on shear stress partitioning
              between the roughness elements and the intervening surface for a range of rocky
              desert and sand sheet sites. This will enable testing and improvement of
              existing theoretical models for shear stress partitioning. The research will
              lead to the development of an improved and universally applicable model for
              estimating sediment transport by wind on surfaces that are covered by varying
              densities of non-erodible roughness elements.
