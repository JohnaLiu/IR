Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
              for the support of a CRCD project entitled, " Combined Research-Curriculum
              Development in Computational Materials Science and Nanoscale Science and
              Engineering," under the direction of Dr. David M. Ceperley.  This project will
              develop curricular materials for advanced undergraduate and beginning
              graduate-level computational materials science (CMS) courses based on cutting
              edge, contemporary research, with an emphasis on problems in nanoscale science
              and engineering.  Topics will include numerical methods in computational
              materials science, parallel and high performance computing, basic simulation
              methods, simulation of quantum systems, Monte Carlo methods, computational
              microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), computational molecular biology and
              computational biotechnology, and scientific visualization.
