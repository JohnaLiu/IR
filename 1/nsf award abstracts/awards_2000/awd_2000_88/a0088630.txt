Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)
In 1998, a pilot program in which chemistry and physics majors
              were exposed to semiconductor processing, integrated circuit fabrication, and
              device characterization was begun. The goal of the new curriculum was to
              prepare physics and chemistry majors for constructive participation in an
              industrial internship program, and ultimately for productive careers in the
              semiconductor manufacturing industry. The program clearly illustrated to the
              students the means by which basic chemistry and physics are essential to the
              preparation of integrated circuits. This pilot program was an overwhelming
              success, partly indicated by the fact that all student participants were
              offered permanent positions as process engineers by semiconductor companies
              located in Oregon. An essential component of this new program is the laboratory
              that is providing hands-on exposure to technologically important techniques not
              traditionally covered in undergraduate physics or chemistry curricula. The
              funds from the NSF-CCLI program are allowing the further development of this
              laboratory by the addition of a mask aligner, probe stations, and other
              measurement equipment. The project shares with the Division of Undergraduate
              Research the goal to prepare students for the technological workplace and to
              provide more effective linkages between higher education and industry.
