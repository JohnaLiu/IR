Abstract    :
              Engineering - Mechanical (56) 

The objectives of this project include the
              development of a data acquisition (DAQ) Laboratory, a required freshmen
              Experiments course, and a upper level required two-course sequence in
              Experimental Projects for Fluids and Heat Transfer. This effort will be modeled
              after Drexel's Engineering Test, Design, and Simulation Laboratory and Colorado
              School of Mines' Multidisciplinary Engineering Laboratory sequence, which have
              both been successfully adapted by other schools. The experimental skills gained
              in the freshmen year will be reinforced throughout the curriculum in classroom
              demonstrations, required open- ended projects, senior design projects and
              undergraduate research. The project addresses the need to improve the way in
              which we teach the art of experimentation to undergraduates. In the open-ended
              laboratory, students participate in multidisciplinary projects and co- op
              opportunities involving electrical and computer components, sensors, data
              acquisition software or controls. Introducing hands- on experiments, especially
              in the first year, addresses the high attrition rate often found among women
              and minorities, who may lack the mechanical tinkering experience of traditional
              engineering students.
