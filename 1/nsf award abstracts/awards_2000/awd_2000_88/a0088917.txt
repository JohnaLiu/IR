Abstract    :
              This award continues an extremely productive program in the theoretical
              treatment of electron collisions with atoms and ions.  The main approach, the
              R-matrix with pseudostates method, is used to examine electronic excitation,
              the calculation of Stokes parameters and electron impact ionization of both
              simple and complex atomic targets.  Close collaboration with other theorists
              and experimentalists in North America, Europe and Australia enable a
              comparision of methods as well as providing experimental validation of the
              overall approach.  The PI has been extrordinarily successful in training
              undergraduates in atomic physics.
