Abstract    :
              Geology (42) 
This project is incorporating new analytical instrumentation in
              undergraduate instructional laboratories -- an ICP-AES and an ion chromatograph
              (IC). With these instruments, we are restructuring the Earth Science
              curriculum, putting more emphasis on learning geochemical principles and
              processes, following the recommendations in Ireton, Manduca, and Mogk, "Shaping
              the Future of Undergraduate Earth Science Education" (AGU, 1996). Five key
              changes are taking place. (1) Upper-level courses in geochemistry are being
              redesigned to focus on low-temperature and environmental geochemistry. The
              laboratory component to these courses includes a skills enhancement component
              and a project component. (2) The project component is teaching students to
              develop a research proposal with an experimental design, to implement the
              research, and to analyze the research findings with an emphasis on technical
              writing skills. This part of our project is adapting the work of Catherine
              Carlson in designing a hydro-geochemistry course at Eastern Connecticut State
              University, "Field Research as a Pedagogical Tool for Learning
              Hydrogeochemistry and Scientific Writing Skills," Journal of Geoscience
              Education (1999) Vol. 47, pp. 150-157. (3) We are adding a project-based
              component to the introductory geology course, giving students experience in the
              use of analytical instruments, data collection, and analysis. This feature is
              adapting the approach developed by Dunnivant et al., "A Comprehensive Stream
              Study Designed for an Undergraduate Non-Majors Course in Earth Science,"
              Journal of Geoscience Education (1999) Vol. 47, pp. 158-165. Students are
              required to undertake an environmental investigation using locally available
              groundwater and surface water resources. (4) We are providing enhanced
              opportunities for undergraduates in the honors program and in independent study
              to use advanced analytical techniques in their projects. (5) In addition we are
              providing enhanced opportunities for undergraduates in the senior seminar. We
              have redesigned this seminar to be a capstone course. The objective is to
              increase students' ability acquire and interpret geochemical data in support of
              broader earth science concepts and theories.
