Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59) 

This project is implementing active, experiential-
              based learning to improve the education of biomedical engineers at Tulane
              University. Undergraduate curricular modifications are based upon Kolb's
              learning cycle, which encourages peer interactions, engages multiple learning
              styles, and promotes a deep understanding of course material. The project
              encompasses the entire learning cycle within a large set of basic- to- advanced
              undergraduate biomedical engineering courses, thereby increasing students'
              capacity to learn complex, interdisciplinary biomedical engineering material.
              

Classroom and laboratory instruction are linked through eight new or
              substantially- revised courses that span the undergraduate curriculum. These
              courses combine theory with bench- top and computational laboratory experiences
              so as to build students' intuition of physical and physiological processes. In
              addition, a core set of courses that "bridge" from science, math and
              engineering fundamentals to biomedical engineering applications has been
              developed to foster the progression from the study of traditional engineering
              to that of Biomedical Engineering.
