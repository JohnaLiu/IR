Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12) 

Hood College, a liberal arts college focusing on the
              education of women, is introducing capillary electrophoresis (CE) technology
              into General Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry, and Biological Chemistry courses.
              The CE applications are being adapted and implemented from the research and
              educational literature, targeting these applications toward a different
              audience, our women students. Since the concepts underlying separation
              techniques are fundamental to research in many areas of science and since
              capillary electrophoresis is rapidly becoming the separation tool of choice in
              many modern laboratories, it is important for students to become knowledgeable
              with this technology. We are incorporating CE separation of caffeine in
              beverages into our General Chemistry courses and some of these students are
              using CE separations for their end-of-the-year project. In Analytical
              Chemistry, students are gaining an understanding of separation parameters
              through the application of CE technology in the investigation of "real world"
              problems such as water pollution. In Biological Chemistry, CE is being used to
              investigate amino acid charge/pH relationships, to sequence a dipeptide, to
              separate DNA restriction fragments, and to investigate parameters important in
              protein separations.
