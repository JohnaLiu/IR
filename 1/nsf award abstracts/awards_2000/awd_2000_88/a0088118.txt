Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Texas A&M University for the support of a three
              year Combined Research-Curriculum Development (CRCD) project entitled,
              "Development of an Integrated Multidisciplinary Curriculum for Intelligent
              Systems," under the direction Dr. Dimitris C. Lagoudas.  The project will
              develop both a curriculum track in Aerospace Engineering and a
              multidisciplinary engineering minor in Intelligent Systems.  Both the
              curriculum innovations will be built around intelligent controlled
              reconfigurable vehicles, which is currently an area of active research by the
              project team.
