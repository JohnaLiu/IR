Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)
Technology is being incorporated into first and second year
              chemistry courses via eight ScienceWorks workstations. Incorporation of
              technology into introductory chemistry is the next step in the continuous
              reform in the Department of Chemistry. The workstations allow the laboratories
              to move from traditional 'recipe' experiments to inquiry-based experiments by
              decreasing the amount of time needed for data acquisition. This allows students
              more time to analyze, to interpret data, and to develop critical thinking
              skills necessary to be successful in the work place. Current experiments are
              being revised and new experiments are being adapted from a variety of sources,
              including ChemLinks modules, the Middle Atlantic Discovery Chemistry Project
              (MADCP), and other literature sources, to make full use of the new equipment,
              such as pH sensors to monitor pH changes in a titration reaction. The
              workstations also are being used to modify 'traditional' lecture settings to a
              more active learning environment by using 'mini' lecture experiments, CD-ROMs,
              and internet sites such as those provided through ChemLinks and others. As a
              result, professors are able to address the multiple learning styles of our
              students. For example, difficult concepts such as valence shell electron pair
              repulsion are addressed by the blackboard, models, and computer simulated 3-D
              models from websites and CD-ROMS. The workstations also are used for
              inquiry-based lecture learning using ConcepTests developed by New Traditions
              and activities from ChemLinks modules.
