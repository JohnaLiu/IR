Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61) 
The complexity of human movement has led to teaching
              practices that compartmentalize physiological systems. Current research has
              identified the need to take a more integrated approach when solving problems by
              accounting for interactions between physiological systems. This project is
              adapting innovative research tools and implementing problem-based pedagogical
              strategies from the science education literature that enable undergraduate
              Kinesiology students to discover and develop a clearer understanding of how
              human physiological systems interact to achieve human movement. Equipment is
              being acquired to create hands-on inquiry based laboratory experiences that
              focus on muscle metabolism and force generation in relation to human movement.
              Web-based software, multimedia, computational tools, and technical expertise is
              being used to create a student friendly interactive interface that enables
              students to explore real world problems, make multilevel connections between
              concepts, and think laterally through self-directed manipulation of multimedia
              source data and physiological system simulations. The integration of
              experimentation and multimedia tools in the curriculum engages the students in
              real world problem solving and enables the students to apply scientific
              principles, discover relationships using inquiry based experimentation, and
              critically assess and communicate the implications of the results. Students
              solve problems independently, as a group and with community groups and gain
              multimedia, computational, communication, and literacy skills through their
              interaction with instructional technology.
