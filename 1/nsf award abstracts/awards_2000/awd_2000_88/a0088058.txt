This is a three-year project to maintain and augment as
              necessary, the network of approximately fifty automatic weather stations
              established on the Antarctic continent and on several surrounding islands. 
              These weather stations measure surface wind, pressure, temperature, humidity,
              and in some instances other atmospheric variables, such as snow accumulation
              and incident solar radiation, and report these via satellite to a number of
              ground stations.  The data are used for operational weather forecasting in
              support of the United States Antarctic program, for climatological records, and
              for research purposes.  The AWS network, which began as a small-scale program
              in 1980, has been extremely reliable and has proven indispensable for both
              forecasting and research purposes.
