Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)

Fluorescence spectroscopy is widely used in research,
              industry, medicine, forensics, and other technological areas as a tool for
              investigating chemical structure and properties, chemical interactions,
              biomolecular structure and function, lifetime imaging, quantitative analysis,
              atom-tagging in immunoassays, metabolic monitoring via luminescent reporter
              genes, and many other applications. The ability to use fluorescence
              spectroscopy in the science curricula is enhancing student learning by 1)
              allowing for the development of practical skills in the operation and
              collection of fluorescent measurements and 2) using real data to help students
              understand spectroscopic theory by assimilating the underlying principles of
              quantum mechanics and electronic/ energy transitions. This project is focusing
              on the immediate adaptation and implementation of experiments from the research
              and educational literature into the curriculum at all levels: general,
              analytical, instrumentation, biochemistry, and physical. The Environmental
              Science department is adapting and implementing fluorescence spectroscopy into
              the curriculum for their Site Monitoring and Analysis track. This fluorometer
              is also an integral part of undergraduate research projects as part of a
              capstone experience cooperatively administered through the Biology and
              Chemistry departments. After this initial implementation, fluorescence
              spectroscopy will be integrated into new curricular offerings at Carroll
              College, including a new Forensic Science emphasis within the Chemistry major,
              a newly proposed Biochemistry major, and a restructured, modular
              instrumentation course offered jointly with Biology.
