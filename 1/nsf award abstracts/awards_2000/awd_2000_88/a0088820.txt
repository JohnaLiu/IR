Abstract    :
              Physics (13) The project is adapting problem-based learning and infusing modern
              technology and modern teaching methods into the required first two years of
              undergraduate laboratories for physics majors. These courses lay the foundation
              of experimental physics methods and techniques for majors. A thorough
              examination of the construction of the current courses reveals that significant
              improvements can be made by implementation of social psychological principles,
              modern educational methods and modern experimental techniques. In the
              laboratories, instead of being told what to measure, the students are given
              modern equipment and taught experimental techniques to enable them to construct
              their own measurements. Students do projects where the results are used later
              in the course or in other courses, connecting the activities of the laboratory
              to real situations. Preliminary efforts in this direction have produced
              strongly positive results. To evaluate this ambitious and non-traditional
              approach, there is a sophisticated assessment strategy to be administered by
              outside assessors. The success of this program will not only benefit one
              institution, but others dedicated to undergraduate laboratory education.
