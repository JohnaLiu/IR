This project involves the design of this university's Security
              Laboratory and security courses that serve as models for security education.
              The project integrates research in computer and network security into upper
              level undergraduate and introductory graduate engineering and computer and
              information science curricula. The project involves the creation of an
              instructional laboratory where students have access to and experiment with
              authentication methods, anti-virus software, encryption algorithms and
              protocols, firewalls and intrusion detection systems, and the development of
              network security topics in several courses including Introduction to Networks
              and Security and Computer Network Security. This project speaks to the
              widespread concern about security issues on intranets and the Internet,
              including: privacy policy, security design, security risk assessment,
              authentication techniques, encryption, incident management, and network
              architectures for security enforcement. In particular, this project focuses on
              the development of high-confidence software systems and it is also relevant to
              several areas of industrial and national importance including wireless
              information technology, IT research, and scalable information infrastructures.
              The transfer of this material into undergraduate and graduate courses is
              important for educating practitioners who develop applications and manage
              facilities that provide seamless availability of networks.
