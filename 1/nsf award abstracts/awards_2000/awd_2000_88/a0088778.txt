Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99) 
An interdisciplinary approach for science and
              technology education opens new opportunities for increasing research-related
              impacts among undergraduate students. This project is creating a unified common
              framework for sharing ideas and knowledge across disciplines. The focus of the
              project is to develop a prototype of six educational modules based on three
              premises commonly shared across disciplines: (1) the concept of patterns, which
              is fundamental to visualizing information; (2) modern computing tools as an
              effective aid in presenting and animating graphical patterns for understanding
              data; and (3) cross disciplinary expertise and data sharing to leverage
              individual efforts in enhancing SMET education. Educational materials are being
              developed to introduce and illustrate this concept of patterns as an
              interdisciplinary approach. In addition, an internet-based community forum is
              being developed to share these educational materials and exchange ideas and
              knowledge across disciplines.
