Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21) 

This project addresses the absence of textbooks
              and courses for prospective K-8 teachers that provide an introduction to
              discrete mathematics and how it can be used both to help prospective K-8
              teachers achieve a better understanding of mathematics and to help their
              students achieve state and national standards in mathematics. The project
              develops an interactive discrete mathematics textbook for prospective K-8
              teachers, changes prospective K-8 teachers' views of mathematics by exposing
              them to a college-level mathematics course which is taught interactively, and
              conducts high-quality professional development workshops for college faculty
              members who teach mathematics to prospective K-8 teachers. The project builds
              on the materials developed in a previous NSF-funded professional development
              project for K-8 teachers.
