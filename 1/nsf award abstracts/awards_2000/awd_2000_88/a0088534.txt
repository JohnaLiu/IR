Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)

Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) is an indispensable tool
              for the quantitative analyses of trace elements critical to environmental
              health. To provide undergraduates with experience with environmentally relevant
              AAS, the Departments of Chemistry and Geological Sciences are introducing
              intensive, hands-on, project-oriented experiments in Instrumental Methods
              Laboratory, Environmental Chemistry, and Aqueous Geochemistry Laboratory.
              Students in the upper-division chemistry courses are also performing an
              analysis of lead in paint chip samples gathered and prepared by General
              Chemistry laboratory students. Collaboratively, the advanced and beginning
              chemistry students are preparing a report for the Memphis and Shelby County
              Health Department summarizing results and assessing the regional scope of the
              lead-paint risk. Students in the Quantitative Analysis Laboratory are gathering
              trace metal analysis data and creating a database to be used for teaching the
              statistical treatment of experimental data. The AA spectrometer, capable of
              trace-level determinations of metals such as arsenic, selenium, mercury, lead
              and chromium, is also becoming a significant resource for undergraduate
              researchers who choose environmental projects in Chemistry and Geological
              Sciences and for environmental courses in and interdisciplinary research with
              Physics, Geography, Biology, and Biomedical Engineering Departments and the
              Groundwater Institute.
