Abstract    :
              (34) Software Engineering 

This work develops a project testbed and
              corresponding hands-on exercises to introduce the software development of
              event-driven systems, an area of great interest to industry. The testbed uses
              the theme of a home automation system to introduce the idea of embedded
              "appliances" and to motivate students by making the exercises fun and
              interesting. Student work simulates real world development by providing
              incremental exercises that together comprise a semester-long "project",
              covering the critical elements in the software development process lifecycle.
              With a diverse and interesting set of external entities, students observe the
              effects of changes in the requirements as the instructor introduces real-world
              problems in concurrency and uncertainty and illustrates the effects of dynamic
              external entities. 

The target group includes undergraduate students
              majoring in computer science and computer engineering. The developed materials
              can be duplicated easily and inexpensively at other educational institutions.
              The use of these student projects begins to address deficiencies in software
              engineering education and better prepares students for a career in software
              engineering.
