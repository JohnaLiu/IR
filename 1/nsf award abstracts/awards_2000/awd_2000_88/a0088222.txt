Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)
A Varian 360-L NMR spectrometer which has been converted to a
              Fourier Transform instrument has become an integral part of the laboratory
              experience of students at this institution's Department of Chemistry and
              Physics. It has enhanced undergraduate student research projects and increased
              interaction between sections of the Department. It is critical to curriculum
              development as the Department emphasizes the multidisciplinary and
              interdisciplinary nature of science. Students from a local community college
              are provided access to the instrument.
