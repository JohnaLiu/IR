Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12) Computerized data acquisition is introduced in introductory
              chemistry laboratories through use of handheld personal computers (HPCs). This
              is an affordable approach that permits individual computers to be available at
              each student work station without crowding existing laboratory space. These
              computers, although much smaller than PCs, are powerful enough for most
              laboratory applications and operate in manner that closely matches the screen
              display of conventional computers. They use similar operating systems and
              programming languages and conventional serial data converters. Software is
              designed to closely match the conventional graphics windows of PCs and most
              experiments include Web based prelab and post lab exercises on conventional
              PCs, including simulations that use nearly identical commands and screen
              appearance. The goals are to provide a cost effective method to modify existing
              courses to reflect modern chemical instrumentation and the role of computers in
              laboratories. The types of experiments included in the curriculum and adapted
              for use with the HPCS are being expanded, with emphasis on selecting those with
              a strong visual component, such as where the data appears as a graph in a few
              minutes. Such short experiments permit multiple runs and allow visual
              comparisons of the effect of variations in experimental conditions. The program
              affects approximately 3000 students over the next five years and has strong
              potential to serve as a model at other institutions.
