Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

The objectives of the project are to use a
              laboratory classroom to implement curricular changes in courses taken by
              pre-service teachers of mathematics. The objectives are achieved by adapting
              the Calculus, Concepts, Computers, and Cooperative Learning project developed
              by Ed Dubinsky of Georgia State University. A major outcome of the project is
              to create an environment that blends technology into the teaching and learning
              of mathematics.

A main component of the project is the construction of a new
              classroom with laptop computers connected to a university wide server. This
              laboratory provides the correct properties needed to help achieve the
              objectives. The laptop computers have a low profile, which helps to maintain a
              more balanced classroom atmosphere. The project emphasizes integration of
              technology in education and teacher preparation. From this project pre-service
              teachers obtain greater exposure to technology in a setting that exemplifies
              ways that software and collaboration are used to teach mathematics. An ongoing
              evaluation and dissemination program is fully integrated into the project.
