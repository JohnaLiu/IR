Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61)
We are creating an Integrated Histology Laboratory
              (IHL) that provides hands-on histology experiences for undergraduates majoring
              in biology, chemistry, environmental science, and science education, as well as
              those involved in faculty-directed, student research. The IHL includes a
              JB-microtome and related equipment, a vacuum oven, and fume absorbers. The IHL
              allows the Biology and Chemistry Departments to further increase student
              training in the process of science, gives students experiences with modern
              histological technology, and promote scientific collaboration. Exercises in our
              organismal courses and some of our senior-level capstone courses are being
              re-designed to take advantage of the pedagogic opportunities created by the IHL
              to develop laboratory skills and improve critical thinking. In the Biology
              Introductory Sequence, students currently use prepared histological slides to
              understand the relationship of structure and function in a diversity of
              organisms. Based on that foundation, students in Biology, Chemistry,
              Environmental Science and Teacher Education are being introduced to the
              techniques of modern histological analysis and their utility in exploring
              topics as diverse as mechanisms regulating organismal development to
              ecotoxicology. At the Senior level, students are expected to conduct
              independent research projects as part of courses and faculty-mentored research.
              The projects uses as a foundation an NSF-funded project carried out by the
              Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS) group.
