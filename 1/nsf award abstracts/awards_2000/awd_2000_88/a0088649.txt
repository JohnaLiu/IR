Abstract:

In this research, chips will be fabricated by
              monolithic integration of replication molded fluidics with optics and active
              detectors.  These devices will consist of flow channels, including valves and
              pumps, made from silicone elastomer.  In the simplest design, these will be
              aligned onto micro-optic detector chips with filtered p-n diode detectors and
              diffractive optic lenses for coupling light into and out of the chip in order
              to perform fluorescence measurements and manipulation of sub-nanoliters volumes
              of fluid.  The integration of optics with replication molded microfluidics is
              expected to lead to the construction of very compact but versatile biological
              testing systems.

The main application for these chips will be rapid analysis
              of cellular information, either of gene expression pattern by RNA analysis or
              of protein levels through antibody assays. It is also anticipated that this
              effort will enable the construction of inexpensive and disposable
              multifunctional bio-sensor chips compact enough to ultimately be implanted into
              a host.  Since valves and pumps are already integrated into the microfluidic
              system, the resulting chips can concentrate and measure pathogens or toxins as
              well as deliver drugs in-situ to the host, or perform complex chemical and
              biological analyses.
