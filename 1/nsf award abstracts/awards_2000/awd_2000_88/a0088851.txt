Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99) 
This project creates public, interdisciplinary science
              education Web-based instructional modules that combine core, interdisciplinary
              science lessons with interactive multimedia material, research reports,
              historical biographies and other excellent Web resources to present students
              with a high-quality, inquiry-based learning experience. These modules are
              launched in an education Web portal, Visionlearning, which allows science
              instructors to combine a custom set of these modules with their own course
              content,
such as a syllabus, to easily create a personal Web classroom. This
              project helps to overcome the barriers that prevent widespread use of the Web
              in science education by providing a content-rich yet fast and easy-to-use
              system to introduce instructors to educational technology. This project
              provides free interdisciplinary science Web lessons, promotes faculty use of
              instructional technology, creates bilingual science resources and
              quantitatively evaluates all of the resources developed.
