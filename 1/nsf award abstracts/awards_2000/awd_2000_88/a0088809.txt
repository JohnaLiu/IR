Abstract    :
              Engineering - Electrical (55)

This project is developing a real-time computer
              controlled Power Electronics and Drives Laboratory that consists of
              object-oriented software based experiments, modular based hardware experiments,
              and state-of-the-art industrial drives from Allen-Bradley. Specific practices
              and products that are being adapted are the use of object-oriented modeling of
              components from RPI and Virginia Tech, and hardware implementation through
              power electronic building blocks from Technical University of Munich.

The
              main features of the laboratory include PC software, DSP-based control
              hardware, signal conditioning units and device drives and opto-isolation for
              power electronic converters. Object-oriented modeling and visual programming
              employ computer tools such as Saber and PEMag.

Students are learning through
              "hands-on" experience in graphical modeling and simulation,
design, analysis,
              and prototyping of power electronics experiments, the operation of industrial
              grade drives, and through web-based and CD-ROM modular materials.
