Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99) This project is adapting from widely used texts and
              laboratory manuals existing inquiry-based, field-tested laboratory exercises
              developed for introductory or general education courses in physics, biology,
              and chemistry. Exercises are being modified so that they can be performed using
              laboratory equipment specifically designed for middle school use. All lab
              exercises are utilizing the same basic core equipment, so that students can
              concentrate on the inquiry and not on learning how to use multiple pieces of
              highly specialized equipment. The modified lab exercises will be made available
              for other users, though publication and web-based dissemination.
