Abstract    :
              Earth Systems Science (40)
Recent trends in science education have emphasized
              the active engagement of students in learning. In geophysics, this has led to
              increased emphasis on field courses, especially in the area of environmental
              geophysics, where employment opportunities are the greatest for new graduates.
              In this project we are adapting and implementing proven field methods for a new
              environmental geophysics field course for undergraduate earth systems science
              majors at The City College of New York. This course is being modeled after
              published descriptions of those already taught at Smith College, Boston
              College, and Arizona State University. In addition to geophysical concepts and
              the use of geophysical equipment, the new course stresses teamwork and engages
              students in surveys at realistic urban sites. The new equipment purchased for
              this project, a ground conductivity meter and an Overhauser Magnetometer (and
              related software), are also being used by undergraduates enrolled in City
              College's new Environmental Project course. This course is required for all
              earth systems science majors and involves a semester-long research project.
