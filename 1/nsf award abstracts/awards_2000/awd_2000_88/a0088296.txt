This award provided funds to purchase several pieces of
              equipment for use in the Salish Kootenai College Environmental Laboratory
              (SKCEL), associated with Salish Kootenai College. This laboratory is providing
              practical experience for the native American students enrolled in the
              Environmental Science program as they monitor the environmental quality of
              tribal lands. The laboratory is adapting research and/or EPA protocols for the
              analysis of inorganic species and implementing the analyses into various
              courses. The educational and practical experience of the student is being
              enhanced by the introduction of modern instrumentation and analytical
              methodology into these courses. The award is also allowing the Principal
              Investigator to plan an additional course, Environmental Chemistry I, that will
              become part of an expanded Environmental Science curriculum.
