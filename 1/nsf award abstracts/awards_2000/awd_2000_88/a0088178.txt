Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31) 
This project is developing materials and techniques for
              implementing pair learning in undergraduate computer science laboratory
              exercises and programming assignments. Pair-learning is a technique for
              educating computer science students in which students work on programs in pairs
              at one computer. We are conducting educational studies at diverse institutions
              to measure the impact of pair-learning on our students' aptitude for, and
              attitudes toward, computer science. Based on this experience, we are creating
              and disseminating educational materials for teachers, teaching assistants, and
              students to support the transition from solo-learning to pair-learning. These
              materials include: a textbook, lecture slides, laboratory exercises, a
              collaborative web site, a web-based data tracking tool, teaching assistant
              training materials, and journal and conference presentations and publications.
              We conducting longitudinal studies of the performance of students in classes in
              which pair-learning is used and in all subsequent computer science
              classes.
