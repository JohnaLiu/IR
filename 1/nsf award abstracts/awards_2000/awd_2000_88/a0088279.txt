Abstract    :
              Engineering - Electrical (55)

This project is developing a photonics
              curriculum with a relevant laboratory based on an "industrial model" that
              implements case studies. The format of the laboratory is being adapted from an
              existing NSF-supported "empty bench" model. We extend this format to an
              "industrial model" that reinforces relevance by simulating the industry
              environment of the case study. This model incorporates problem based learning
              by requiring student construction of all experiments, links cognitive and
              skills-based learning by linking labs
and lectures, and incorporates photonics
              technology into instruction while stimulating
student interest by giving teams
              control over purchasing decisions. 
 Novel assessment instruments are being
              employed to measure effectiveness of this methodology.
