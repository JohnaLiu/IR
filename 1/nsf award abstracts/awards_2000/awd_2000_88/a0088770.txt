Multidisciplinary environmental problems
              associated with urban/suburban growth are
increasingly being addressed at a
              watershed-integrated level. Consistent with this theme, the
proposed project
              involves undergraduate students using a comprehensive network of automated
              water quantity and water quality instrumentation to investigate environmental
              impacts in a rapidly-developing watershed (the Bushkill Creek Watershed)
              adjacent to campus. Hydrologic and chemical data are collected and analyzed as
              part of exercises within existing engineering and geoscience courses and
              undergraduate research and honors theses. These exercises enhance our students'
              abilities to critically evaluate a variety of interdependent watershed-based
              processes that may affect environmental quality. The project is a cooperative
              effort among faculty from engineering and the geological sciences; however,
              other faculty teaching courses with environmental content have an interest in
              using the facilities and the databases generated by the project. 

The
              general objectives of the project are: to provide relevant hands-on data
              collection
and analysis experiences for undergraduates in science and
              engineering, to establish a central
theme of assessment and management of a
              rapidly developing watershed for a variety of
curriculum projects across
              campus, to develop a detailed digital database on hydrologic impacts of land
              use in the watershed, and to disseminate results through the internet,
              conference presentations, scholarly publications, and local community
              meetings.

The project is patterned after similar watershed-based curriculum
              projects at a number of
small colleges and universities in the northeast U.S.
              (Hluchny 1997, 1998; Heins and Walker,
1998; Woltemade and Blewett, 1999;
              Salvage and Graney, 1999, 2000). Unique to this project are: (1) the
              comprehensive monitoring network and full watershed scale (200 km 2 ); (2)
              strong geologic and land use contrasts, and rapid development within the basin;
              (3) cooperation and collaboration between engineering and geological science
              students and faculty; (4) emphasis on enhancing undergraduate education in
              practical multidisciplinary issues such as watershed-based planning and land
              use decisions, and storm water management policy; and (5) the high level of
              involvement of the local community and local government in watershed
              management.
