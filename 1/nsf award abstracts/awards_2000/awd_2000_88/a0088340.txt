Abstract



This research will use the Advanced
              Electro-Optical System (AEOS) of the Air Force with its operational adaptive
              optics to obtain high-resolution images of the potassium in the atmospheres of
              Io and Europa.  This work will provide an analysis and observational
              verification for the sources and the sinks of potassium.  The scattered light
              performance of the telescope system will be improved by using coronagraphic
              optics in addition to the adaptive optics.  The adaptive optics will sharpen up
              the satellite images and an occulting disk will be used at the primary focal
              plane to reduce the bright image of the satellite surface to image the
              satellite atmosphere against the cold dark space background.  The instrument
              will employ an innovative image slicer recently developed to detect gases in
              planetary atmospheres.
