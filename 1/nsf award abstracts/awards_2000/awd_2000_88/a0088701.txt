Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)

The chemistry department at Friends University, as a part of
              developing learning outcome goals for our students and the resulting assessment
              of our program, has begun making major changes in our curriculum to improve our
              program. The next step in our curriculum improvement is to integrate the use of
              a modern computer interfaced FTIR instrument into a number of courses. A number
              of experiments from the Journal of Chemical Education are being adapted for
              this purpose. The FTIR is being introduced throughout the curriculum to
              increase student interest, to involve students in independent projects, and to
              serve as a complementary tool to other instrumental techniques already
              available for undergraduate use. In the beginning classes, the speed and ease
              of use of the FTIR and the simplicity of interpreting spectra as molecular
              fingerprints allows students to collect high quality data and to make decisions
              based on the results. The FTIR is making possible major changes in upper level
              laboratory courses by allowing development of new experiments and studies. The
              instrument also is used in Summer Workshops for secondary teachers and for high
              school students involved in the Junior Academy of Science and our Summer
              Science Program.
