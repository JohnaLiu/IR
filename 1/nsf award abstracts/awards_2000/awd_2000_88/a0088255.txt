Abstract    :
              Earth Systems Science (40) Undergraduate students in science and engineering
              curricula are frequently bound by disciplines, taught multitudes of
              reductionist facts endemic to multiple disciplines, and evaluated by
              competitive measure. Yet they are expected to emerge into professions that
              function in interdisciplinary, problem-based modes demanding creative and
              cooperative decisions. Approaching learning in a constructivist, collaborative
              manner, using Earth system topics of environmental significance, and applying
              modern as well as traditional technologies for science data acquisition and
              analysis can offer students a unique opportunity to develop knowledge,
              attitudes and skills for 21st century careers in science, engineering and
              technology. This project is developing, offering and assessing a prototype
              course for use in higher education institutions and field facilities in coastal
              areas. As an earth systems sciences course it focuses on relationships among
              elements of the hydrosphere, atmosphere, lithosphere and biosphere of coastal
              and offshore areas, and it is driven by environmental questions that link the
              systems with human society. A combination of high-tech tools are employed, such
              as satellite imagery, datasheets on line, digital models, as well as
              traditional field technologies for ground truth measurements and supplements to
              more global datasets. Processes of instruction are based on construction of
              learning through experiences, collaborative group process and problem-based
              learning. Alternative assessment will be used to evaluate course outcomes in
              non-competitive ways.
