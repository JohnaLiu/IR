Abstract    :
              Political Science (85) 
Test data compiled by the University of Southern
              Mississippi indicate that many political science students frequently need
              direct assistance in developing their statistical and critical reasoning
              skills. Political science at USM attracts a large number of female students and
              students who are from under-represented populations. A survey of USM political
              science students in the Fall of 1998 indicated that they wanted opportunities
              to develop greater expertise in using computers to engage in data analysis. The
              department of political science has responded by offering two new courses in
              introductory statistics and research methods. These courses are designed to
              address their needs and provide them with a greater understanding of the
              practice of science.
This project is an adaptation of classroom methods
              developed elsewhere. The Principal Investigator developed and used a similar
              approach at Grambling State University. (See "Creating a Critical Thinking
              Learning Environment: Teaching Statistics to Social Science Undergraduates,"
              PS: Political Science and Politics, 1996, pp. 517-521.) This project is also
              adapting materials from (1) Beth Chance, "Experience with Authentic Assessment
              Techniques in an Introductory Statistics course," Journal of Statistics
              Education, Vol. 5, No. 3, 1997; (2) Sandra Fillebrown, "Using projects in an
              Elementary Statistics Course for Non-Majors," Journal of Statistics Education,
              Vol. 2, No. 2, 1994; (3) Gerald Giraud, "Cooperative Learning and Statistics
              Learning," Journal of Statistics Education," Vol. 5, No. 3 1997; and (4) Gary
              Smith, "Learning Statistics by Doing Statistics," Journal of Statistics
              Education, Vol. 6, No. 3, 1998. The project makes extensive use of peer
              interaction, following the suggestions made by Simon Hooper, "Effects of Peer
              Interaction during computer based Mathematics Instruction," Journal of
              Educational Research, Vol. 41, No. 2, 1990, pp. 180-189. We are refining a
              process for teaching statistical analysis, data analysis skills, and critical
              thinking to undergraduate students in political science in a way that will have
              a lasting impact. We are using computer-based technology in the classroom and
              teaching our students exploratory data analysis techniques. (See for example,
              John Tukey, Exploratory Data Analysis, Addison-Wesley, 1977; Lawrence Hamilton,
              Modern Data analysis: A first Course in Applied Statistics, Brooks/Cole
              Publishers, 1990; James Mullenex, "Box Plots: Basic and Advanced," Mathematics
              Teacher, 1990, pp.108-112; Frederick Hartwig and Brian Dearning, "Exploratory
              Data Analysis," Sage Publications, 1979; Peter Barbella, Lorraine Denby, and
              James Landwehr, "Beyond Exploratory Data Analysis: The Randomization Test,"
              Mathematics Teachers, 1990, pp. 144-149; and Gretchen Davis, "Using Data
              Analysis to Explore Class Enrollment," Mathematics Teacher, 1990, pp. 104-106.)
              Our classroom environment is one of both collaborative learning (See, for
              example, Lois Rubin and Catherine Hebert, "Model for Active Learning:
              Collaborative Peer Teaching," College Teaching, 1998, pp. 26-30) and peer
              teaching (See, for example, Brian Keller, Chris Russell, and Heather Thompson,
              "effects of Student-Centered Teaching on Student Evaluations in Calculus,"
              Educational Research Quarterly, 1999, pp. 79-93) where students work with a
              partner who is assigned based upon scores on a course pretest. The focus of
              this course is an experiential learning model. We are employing data sets drawn
              from two national social and political surveys used by researchers in political
              science - the General Social Survey (1972 to present) and the National
              Elections Studies Data sets (1948 to present), preparing samples of each year
              for use by students both as cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis (the use
              of "real-life" data sets has been adopted by a number of university faculty
              including faculty at Virginia Technical University, West Virginia State
              College, and Hunter College - CUNY). By using the same data that researchers
              use in their work, we are able to link research to teaching, and prepare our
              students to eventually design and carry out their own study using these data
              sources.
