Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12) This project is undertaking systematic redesign of the
              introductory chemistry courses beginning with the general chemistry sequence.
              The approximately 2000 students targeted per calendar year represent a broad
              cross- section of the entering class and include new students to the College of
              Engineering, preprofessional students who expect to continue studies in
              pharmacy, medicine, dentistry, and science education, and majors in the College
              of Liberal Arts. The redesign makes use of active learning pedagogies and other
              approaches which address the students' different learning styles. The two
              critical components of the overall curricular redesign are: (1) a mathematics
              and calculator skills tutorial that is web- based and (2) a chemistry knowledge
              assessment designed to be taken at both the beginning and end of the first
              semester course in order to measure the efficacy of student learning from the
              course changes. The remainder of the redesign elements makes extensive use of
              materials and pedagogy adapted from several NSF Systemic Initiatives in
              Chemistry.
