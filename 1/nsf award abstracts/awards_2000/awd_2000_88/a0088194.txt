Abstract    :
              Geology (42) 

The Geology Department at Hamilton is adapting the concept of
              the "studio classroom", which has been used successfully at other institutions
              to teach physics, mathematics, and engineering, to create a networked studio
              classroom for polarized light microscopy. The project combines the systematic
              use of technology within an environment that enables cooperative learning. The
              "studio" features clusters of four petrographic work stations configured to
              promote student group work. Each petrographic microscope has an integrated live
              video feed networked to a computer at the cluster. The instructor has a central
              work station with incoming video feeds, one from each cluster, and two outgoing
              feeds, one to each of two data projectors. The instructor's work station serves
              as a selection and switching device so that a real- time video image from any
              of the microscopes can be delivered to either of the data projectors for
              display on a large screen for student discussion. The classroom allows us to
              revolutionize teaching of the microscopic study of geologic materials in
              virtually all courses in the Department and to introduce inquiry- based
              activities, cooperative learning, and group learning that are difficult in a
              traditional microscopy lab, where each student works in isolation.
