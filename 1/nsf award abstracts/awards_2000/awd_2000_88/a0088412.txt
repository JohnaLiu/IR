Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61) Recent growth in genomic research and microbiology at
              Middlebury College has generated interest in the genomic modification of
              eukaryotic cells and in the visual examination of the phenotypic effects of
              such modification. Students now use green fluorescent protein (GFP) to
              "naturally" tag wild- type and mutant E2F transcription factors, follow their
              localization and monitor their function in cultured mammalian cells, in an
              extended laboratory project newly adapted and implemented as a paradigm for the
              genomic modification of eukaryotic cells. They examine these genomically
              modified cells using inverted microscopes equipped for fluorescence and
              differential interference contrast optics in a newly constructed Imaging
              Facility. They also use a cryostat and this facility, including upright
              microscopes with fluorescence and DIC optics, for advanced study and course
              research projects in endocrinology, immunology, and developmental biology as
              well as cell biology. Additionally, provision of these microscopes with digital
              capturing, display and storage capabilities allows students to work at each
              work station in small groups and encourages their active collaboration in data
              collection and analysis. Procedures implemented in this project are adapted
              from various sources, including the scientific literature (e. g., Magae et al.,
              1999; Kavaler et al., 1999; Parfitt and Newman, 1998) and monographs and
              technical manuals (e. g., Conn, 1999; Lefkovits, 1996). The results of this
              project are evaluated primarily through the analysis of portfolios of student
              reports prepared before and after they used the Imaging Facility, fluorescence
              and DIC microscopes, and cryostat and by tracking student outcomes during
              matriculation and following graduation.
