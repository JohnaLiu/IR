Abstract    :
              Physics (13) An Optics for Scientists and Engineers Laboratory Course is being
              developed and implemented to provide undergraduate students with the
              fundamentals necessary to enable them to successfully apply optics in their
              respective disciplines. The course is targeted to a wide cross section of
              students (electrical engineering, physics, chemistry, mechanical engineering,
              biology, etc.). An interdisciplinary faculty team from the Electrical and
              Computer Engineering, Chemistry, and Physics Departments is implementing and
              teaching the course. The course includes a capstone optics experiment related
              to each student's academic major. For many students, this is their only optics
              course. 

The annual one semester course consists of 30 hours of lecture and
              45 hours in the laboratory. Exemplary laboratory experiments developed under
              NSF auspices at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Boston University
              are being adapted and implemented. A commercially available fiber optics kit is
              also being used. The incorporation of extensive hands-on optics experience is a
              key component of the course. Four laboratory stations are equipped with
              research grade optics kits. Not more than two students work at each station,
              and they are expected to select and set-up components from their kit to the
              maximum extent possible. The goal is to provide graduates capable of putting
              basic optics principles to work in their careers, e.g. for optical
              communications, machine vision, spectroscopy, etc. or in graduate school.
