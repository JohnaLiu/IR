Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)

The goal of this project is to enhance student understanding
              of NMR spectroscopy through increased laboratory experiences in both the
              chemistry and biochemistry curriculums. A 300 MHz Fourier Transform Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (FT NMR) spectrometer and additional copies of NMR
              processing software have been obtained to achieve this goal. Additional
              coverage of NMR, needed to keep pace with current trends, is being added to
              five courses or course sequences: (1) introductory (sophomore) organic
              chemistry; (2) inorganic/organic synthesis; (3) biochemistry; (4) advanced
              analytical chemistry; and (5) undergraduate research.

To achieve the stated
              goals of the proposal, NMR theory and practice is being incorporated at two
              levels. At the first level, all chemistry, biology, and biochemistry students
              are being introduced to 1-D and 2-D NMR experiments in the introductory organic
              chemistry sequence. New experiments from the literature (chemical education and
              research) are being adapted and implemented. At the second level, chemistry and
              biochemistry majors in subsequent courses are conducting additional NMR
              experiments relevant to their areas of interest. NMR experiments from the
              literature are being adapted and implemented into these five courses as well.
              Other suitable experiments, most notably in the biochemistry area, are being
              developed in the Department. Once complete, these experiments will be made
              available to others through adequate dissemination methods.
