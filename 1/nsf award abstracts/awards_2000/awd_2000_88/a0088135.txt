Abstract    :
              This high risk, high potential research is focused on the design and execution
              of experiments to study a new process in layered manufacturing.  The process is
              based upon bulk sintering of powder layers using radiation, as an alternative
              to selective laser sintering (SLS).

The process is anticipated to present
              better dimensional control, reduced machine cost, and reduced fabrication time
              in the production of 3-D structural components. This is a major deviation from
              the traditional research on powder sintering and poses the risks associated
              with new and untested phenomena, as it requires sintering inhibition in
              selected areas.
