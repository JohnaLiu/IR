CRCD:  Instructional
              Modules for Embedded Control System Design

This project develops and
              disseminates a set of instructional modules and laboratory exercises for
              advanced undergraduate and first-year courses in real-time embedded control
              systems.  Students are introduced to concepts and tools that are emerging from
              recent research in hybrid dynamic systems, rapid prototyping and haptic
              interfaces using new commercial tools for computer-aided engineering.  The
              innovative web-based instructional modules provide students with the necessary
              working knowledge of fundamental and advanced concepts needed to work on
              state-of-the-research projects in the laboratory.
