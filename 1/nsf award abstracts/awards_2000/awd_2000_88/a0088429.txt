Abstract    :
              Physics (13) A joint University of Virginia physics-engineering task force has
              recommended on the basis of the ABET 2000 criteria a restructuring of the two
              semester problem session/introductory physics labs for 450 engineering
              students. The results of physics education research in the 1990s indicate that
              there should be more reliance on computer-based tools and new methods of
              instruction and grading. The project is adopting the Real Time Physics
              curriculum as the basis for a new two hour per week workshop/laboratory in
              mechanics, heat and thermodynamics, and electromagnetism. In addition, the
              project is adapting and implementing as many exemplary commercial products as
              possible, but utilizing these products in innovative ways. Assessment and
              evaluation will be crucial in order both to improve the workshop experience for
              students and to educate them in the best way possible. 

 There previously
              was no lab experience for the first semester course. The project is combining
              the former problem recitation session and laboratory (second semester only)
              into a workshop that consists of 
a) A pre-workshop activity utilizing the
              internet based WebAssign program to present a series of conceptual and
              numerical problems to prepare the students for the two hour workshop.
b)
              Utilizing Real Time Physics as the laboratory experience with computer tools
              (probes and software) to engage students in active learning. There will be new
              computers for the cooperative learning groups and probes from PASCO and
              Vernier. 
c) A post workshop activity using peer ranking essay questions on
              WebAssign that test the students understanding of the concepts presented in the
              workshop.
