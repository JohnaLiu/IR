Abstract    :
              0088912  LeBoeuf  The objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly,
              fundamental finite-element and finite-difference based discrete numerical model
              to more fully evaluate a number of proposed mass-transfer limitation processes.
               This model will be used by students, faculty and researchers to investigate
              and understand more fully the effects of mass transfer limitations on the
              distribution, transport, reaction and transformation of contaminants within
              natural or engineered environments.  This project addresses a single particle
              in a two-phase system comprised of water and the particle; future work would
              address gas-phase and, eventually, three-phase (gas-solid-liquid) behavior. 
              The system developed will be made available to interested parties via an
              interactive web-based environment using Prometheus, further enabling prompt,
              two-way communication between the user and the principal investigators. ***
