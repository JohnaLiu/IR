Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31) 


This project develops and evaluates case study
              resources as an essential component of undergraduate human-computer interaction
              (HCI) instruction. The emphasis is on initial development and prototype
              evaluation. The work is integrated with an HCI textbook project already under
              development with a commercial publisher. The textbook differs dramatically from
              current offerings, interleaving the presentation of HCI content with a
              comprehensive scenario- based framework for the development of interactive
              systems. A key innovation of the new textbook is its use of a case study to
              introduce and exemplify the analysis, design, and evaluation framework. The
              project enhances this case study approach, by developing richer and more
              flexible online materials, and by building cases from three additional problem
              domains. The project leverages ongoing research on scenario-based development
              methods and incorporates the methodology concepts into undergraduate education.
              It also highlights the use of information technology in undergraduate
              education, for both content access and student project support.
