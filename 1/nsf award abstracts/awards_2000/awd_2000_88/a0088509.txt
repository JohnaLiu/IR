Superfine
The goal of this research is to study the control over
              molecular motors with an engineering applications perspective, exploring ways
              in which these machines can be used in designed systems, e. g., the synthesis
              and delivery of pharmacological agents.  The specific goals of this research
              are to: (1) demonstrate the control of the patterning of motor raceways as
              functioning tracks for the motion of motor proteins, (2) study the two main
              classes of proteins actin/myosin and microtubule/kinesin to understand their
              relative merits towards nanotechnology applications, (3) study the application
              of single motors and collections of motor proteins, (4) study the coupling of
              nanotubes to electrical circuitry through electro/dielectrokinesis at the
              nonometer scale, and (5) understand a processing methodology for incorporating
              nanometer scale ebeam lithography, nanotube placement/growth, patterned
              chemical functionalization and motor binding and motility.
