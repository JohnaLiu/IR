Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31) 

This project develops four problem-generators on
              programming languages topics. The problem generators are designed to generate
              problems as parameterized instances of a problem template. Their performance
              and use is evaluated over four semesters. The problem generators are expected
              to promote active learning among students and to improve the problem-solving
              skills of students. Problem-based learning improves long-term retention.
              Researchers have advocated the use of self-paced exercises, practice to build
              problem-solving skills, and the use of frequent, graded assignments in a
              course. Faculty are increasingly turning to the use of technology to provide
              practice problems to students. They are developing programs to generate
              problems, and making them available to students for practice. But, such
              programs that provide students with frequent, self- paced exercises have been
              infrequently attempted for computer science topics, because problems in
              computer science are not always quantitative, and they often depend on the
              structure of arbitrary computer programs. This project investigates the
              potential for use of problem-generations in computer science topics in light of
              the unique constraints of the computer science curriculum.
