Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59) 

There is a growing need for accessible design (AD)
              products and services for individuals with disabilities. Relevant laws
              mandating accessibility apply to jobs, public facilities, public
              transportation, public sources of information including public internet
              services, telecommunication products and services, and the full spectrum of
              electronic and information technologies. These laws and others not only mandate
              accessibility, but in many cases they mandate the use of AD principles in the
              design process. However, the lack of designers and engineers with knowledge of
              and expertise in AD principles is a national problem. Faculty, and hence
              students, are not aware of the need for more coverage of AD principles and
              issues. 

To address this need, we are developing curricular material on AD
              principles and issues that is modular and hierarchically structured in
              cooperation with business and academic partners. The hierarchical approach
              means that the material is designed for use in introductory engineering courses
              as well as in advanced theory and design courses. The modular approach allows
              integration of the material in small parts: a lecture topic, homework problems,
              course demonstration or laboratory experiments. The long-term goal of this
              project is to have accessible design material integrated into the undergraduate
              engineering curricula of colleges and universities throughout the United
              States.
