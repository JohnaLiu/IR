This "Mathematics Across the Curriculum" (MAC)
              project is integrating mathematics into curricula that are not typically
              associated with mathematics. The key problem that this project addresses is
              students' lack of opportunity to deepen and reinforce the mathematics that they
              have learned in their mathematics classes as well as understand its greater
              importance and application in their lives. The project is assisting faculty
              across the disciplines to create, evaluate, and modify projects that
              incorporate mathematics. The project is adapting and implementing the results
              and practices of previously funded NSF projects at Dartmouth College and
              Alverno College. Principal investigators from these projects are serving as
              consultants and evaluators for the MAC project. Participants include faculty
              from Washington State community colleges, The Evergreen State College, Western
              Washington University, and the local school district. Additional support is
              being provided by the State Board for Community and Technical Colleges; the
              Puget Sound Center for Teaching, Learning and Technology; the Washington Center
              for the Improvement of Undergraduate Education; and the GTE Service
              Corporation. 

This project is allowing faculty of various disciplines to
              create activities, projects, and/or courses that explicitly incorporate
              mathematical dimensions of their disciplines. Statewide and national
              dissemination of best practices are a planned key outcome.
