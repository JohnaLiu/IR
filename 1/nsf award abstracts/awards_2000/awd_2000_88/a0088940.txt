This project will allow the continuation of the
              national
Summer School in Nuclear Physics, now in its 12th year, for 
an
              additional five years.  This annual school is intended for
advanced graduate
              students and beginning postdoctoral 
researchers in theory or experiment, and
              consists of several
courses of introductory lectures by leading nuclear
              physicists.
One main goal is to provide nuclear physics students with a
broad
              perspective on the field, thereby combating the 
specialization that often
              occurs within focused research
groups.  NSF funding for the school covers the
              expenses
of the lecturers and a portion of the local costs of the
students
              who attend.  More information on this year's school
can be found at
