Psychology - Cognitive (73)
This is a project to equip 5 multi-use
              laboratories in experimental psychology. These labs are adopting and adapting
              commercial "SuperLab" software designed for research and education in
              psychology, following the lead of many other departments, including departments
              in research universities, such as Harvard University and the University of
              Illinois. The labs have been set up using SuperLab as the core, coupled with
              compatible data acquisition cards from National Instruments, a photometer, and
              a sound level meter. These labs have allowed our department to integrate
              technology into a number of psychology courses in sensation, perception and
              cognition, and are providing a platform for increased student participation in
              laboratory research experiences and independent research projects. Students are
              now routinely participating in the design of experiments; stimulus generation,
              measurement, and control; and the setup and configuration of scientific
              apparatus used in psychology research in these areas. Student experiments are
              being supported from three sources. SuperLab LT provides a pool of existing
              experiments from which to draw. SuperLab software provides the technology and a
              bibliographic base of published papers (at www.SuperLab.com/papers/) to support
              adaptations of other experiments for our students. Finally, we are developing
              new experiments using SuperLab Pro.
