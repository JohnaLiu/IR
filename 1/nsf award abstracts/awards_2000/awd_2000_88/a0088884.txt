Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31) This project demonstrates that robotics (in particular,
              the LEGO
Mindstorms platform) can be a cost-effective and widely-applicable
              tool for teaching a significant proportion of the ACM/IEEE Computing Curriculum
              2001 (CC2001) Body of Knowledge. We are developing an extensible set of 30-40
              assignments and laboratory exercises that use LEGO Mindstorms robot kits to
              motivate and support active student learning across applicable knowledge areas
              of the CC2001. Examples of such knowledge areas include concurrency in
              Operating Systems, distributed systems in Networking, and agent design in
              Artificial Intelligence. Secondly we create new software tools and adapt
              existing freeware packages available in the Mindstorms user community for our
              more advanced purposes.
