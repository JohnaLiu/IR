Abstract    :
               Chemistry (12)

Many students have difficulty with the traditional chemistry
              curriculum involving lecture, laboratory, and recitation. This is evidenced by
              decreasing enrollments in both majors-level and non-majors freshman chemistry
              at a significant number of institutions. There also appears to be an increasing
              need to review fundamental concepts of general chemistry in upper-division
              chemistry courses, suggesting retention difficulty. This project is allowing
              the teaching focus to adapt and implement a number of the active-learning
              strategies developed by the NSF sponsored "New Traditions" consortium. The
              program is involving a number of active-learning methodologies (in-class
              writing and thinking assignments, laboratory experiments involving directed
              inquiry, the use of molecular modeling) which are providing the students the
              opportunities to develop skills in analysis methods, data organization, model
              development, data interpretation, drawing conclusions, and correlation of
              relationships among the parameters measured. The award provided funding for a
              "smart classroom" that is allowing students at all levels (initially freshman,
              later extended to upper-division) of chemistry courses to participate in
              inquiry-based instruction.
