Abstract    :
              Electrical Engineering (55) 

The objective of this project is to provide
              freshman engineering students with a realistic, enticing, and exciting
              introduction to their prospective profession. Through design and construction
              of a walking robot, coupled with practical engineering activites (project
              scheduling, manufacturability, economics, etc.), students develop the physical
              intuition needed to understand what more advanced courses are trying to
              accomplish. Skills that are often taken for granted by instructors, e. g., use
              of hand tools and identifying basic components, are taught, and these introduce
              students to the essentials of their chosen profession. Expected outcomes
              include an increased retention rate for traditional, non-traditional, and
              under-represented freshman engineering students, improved performance in
              courses, and more qualified graduates. Support is also used to equip a
              dedicated laboratory as a "learning center" for team activities.
