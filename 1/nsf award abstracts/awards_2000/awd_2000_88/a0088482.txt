Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)
 The proposed project focuses on improving student
              mathematical achievement at the University of Virginia by expanding a pilot
              implementation of the WeBWorK online homework system. We will develop
              comprehensive libraries of WeBWorK problems to be used in Math 111
              (Probability/Discrete Mathematics), Math 121-122 (Applied Calculus I and II),
              and Math 131-132 (Calculus I and II), courses with a total annual enrollment of
              approximately 2300 students. These libraries will allow us to easily expand
              WeBWorK to all sections of the above courses. The problem libraries will be
              indexed for use at the University of Virginia and other institutions.

 To
              provide increased support for student learning, we will also develop an
              extensive collection of online sample problems with solutions, available in
              both HTML and as video clips. The project will include two summer workshops for
              regional postsecondary and secondary teachers interested in learning about the
              WeBWorK system, and will provide assistance to those interested in implementing
              the system. An ongoing evaluation and dissemination program is fully integrated
              into the project.
