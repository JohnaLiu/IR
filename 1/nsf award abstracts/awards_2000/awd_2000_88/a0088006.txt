Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)

Three new lecture/laboratory courses have been designed to
              replace older courses in instrumental analysis, organic analysis, and inorganic
              synthesis. These new courses cut across traditional disciplinary divisions to
              focus on separations and spectroscopy, synthesis, and analysis. These courses
              are taken by upper-level chemistry majors and are incorporating modern
              techniques of separations, spectral analysis, techniques of synthesis, and
              product analysis. This award provided funding so that modern instrumentation
              such as UV-visible spectroscopy, gas chromatography coupled with mass
              spectrometry, capillary electrophoresis, and high performance liquid
              chromatography is now available for the students in these courses. Experiments
              are being adapted from the research and educational literature and implemented
              into these courses. Molecular modeling experiments are augmenting the analysis
              of a variety of experimental data.
