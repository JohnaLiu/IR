CRCD:  A Curriculum in
              Networked and Distributed Systems

This project develops an innovative
              senior/masters-level curriculum designed to:  (a) bring the important new
              technologies in Wireless and Networked Distributed Systems into the classroom,
              (b) make use of novel teaching and evaluation methods to enhance faculty
              productivity in laboratory and project courses, and (c) improve the educational
              value of students' experiences in laboratory and project courses.  The
              laboratory facilities, which are part of this work, also play a key role in
              enabling multi-disciplinary research in networks, communications, embedded
              systems, and controls.  The project crosses several disciplinary boundaries and
              has clearly defined deliverables that expose students to bodies of knowledge in
              great demand in the workforce.  Two leading companies in this emerging area,
              United Technologies and General Electric, mentor this project.
