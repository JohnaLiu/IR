Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)

Despite many efforts, the typical introductory course
              in computer science still does not present the software development process the
              way modern software is actually implemented. Our approach is to combine an
              object-first style with such normally advanced topics as animation, concurrency
              and event-driven programming. The mechanism for doing so is the use of an
              extensive library of routines which provides an environment in which students
              solve interesting problems using simple versions of advanced techniques. By
              gradually reducing the support provided by this library, we introduce students
              to deeper issues in computer science naturally motivating advanced material.
              The results of our work include the library which enables animation,
              concurrency and event-drive programming at the introductory level; a
              self-contained tutorial for this libary; an extensive suite of sample programs
              and exercises which make use of this library; and a textbook. Each of these
              materials will be evaluated at a variety of institutions ranging from college
              preparatory to highly selective.
