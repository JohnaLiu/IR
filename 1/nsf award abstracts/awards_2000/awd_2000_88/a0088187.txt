Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99) We are implementing an innovative distance education
              -based program at Associate Degree colleges of the City University of New York
              which begins to prepare students to become secondary school teachers of science
              and mathematics. The project seeks to address the critical shortage of science
              and mathematics teachers in hard-to staff urban secondary schools, the need to
              increase the pool of underrepresented minorities and women as science and
              mathematics teachers, and the need to involve two year colleges in the teacher
              preparation effort. The outcomes of the project will be (1) an increase in the
              number of students from community colleges and other colleges with Associate
              Degree programs who are recruited and begin their preparation to become
              certified science and mathematics teachers for the secondary schools; (2) an
              improvement in the quality of students' learning about science and mathematics
              concepts and effective educational practice in these subject areas. The longer
              range goal is an increase in the number of science and mathematics majors who
              become state-certified teachers in secondary schools with large enrollments of
              disadvantaged students.

The key elements of the project are: (1) use of
              technology-based distance education to offer Education courses to Associate
              Degree students at various campuses, and the use of these technologies to
              foster the sense of an online learning community; (2) faculty liaisons at each
              partner campus to serve as counselors and mentors to the students, to provide
              motivational support, and supervise activities designed to create a closely
              knit learning community of program participants; (3) field-based teaching
              experiences, with master teacher mentoring, for students as part of their
              earliest education course; and (4) active recruitment, advisement and transfer
              orientation efforts to ensure success in meeting enrollment and retention
              targets and to smooth the transition to a four-year institution.
