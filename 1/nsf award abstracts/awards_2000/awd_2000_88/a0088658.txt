Abstract    :
              Physics (13) This project involves a major upgrade to the Advanced Undergraduate
              Physics Laboratory at Caltech. Specifically, six new experiments are being
              developed -- The Integer Quantum Hall Effect, Superconductor Phase Diagrams,
              Heat Capacity, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Optical Pumping, and Gamma-ray and
              X-ray spectroscopy. Each of the experiments is adapting the work of both
              classic papers in the research literature and contemporary applications to the
              undergraduate lab. The first three experiments are completely new and are
              designed to add condensed matter experiments to the course. These experiments
              are all performed in a commercial cryogenic apparatus that is well suited for
              undergraduate teaching. The last three experiments are major upgrades of
              existing experiments, aimed at injecting more modern experimental techniques
              and equipment into the lab. In all cases the experiments are designed to
              demonstrate modern physics and experimental techniques that provide a useful
              learning experience for the student.
