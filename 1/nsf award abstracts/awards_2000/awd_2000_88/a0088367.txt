Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59) 
This project adapts and builds on the work of the
              successful "Learning Factory" developed as a collaboration among Penn State
              University, the University of Washington, and the University of Puerto Rico
              Mayaguez to close the competency gap among those students who are hired as
              manufacturing engineers and managers. This adaptation scheme is based on five
              major tasks: 1) adaptation and implementation of a more
              practice-balanced/hands-on manufacturing engineering curriculum through
              development of two joint interdisciplinary engineering-business courses,
              Enterprise Conception and Enterprise Design; 2) enhancement of the
              Entrepreneurship-Manufacturing Innovation Laboratory Experience (E-MILE) for
              practice-based learning and innovation; 3) outreach to the academic,
              manufacturing, and pre-college communities; 4) collaboration with industry
              partners; and 5) project assessment to evaluate the progress of activities and
              impact on the learning process and to identify opportunities for continuous
              improvement. Building upon the Learning Factory model, this initiative is
              providing a new course of action in how to stimulate creativity and innovation
              in talented young professionals.
