This award has provided funds to upgrade a Varian EM-390
              continuous wave nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer to a modern Fourier
              transform (FTNMR) instrument and to purchase a new Fourier transform infrared
              spectrometer (FTIR). These instruments are traditionally used in upper-level
              courses such as Organic Chemistry and Instrumental Methods of Analysis.
              However, this award is allowing their use across the entire undergraduate
              curriculum, including Survey Chemistry, General Chemistry, and Biochemistry as
              well as the traditional courses. The experiments in each course are being
              adapted from the research and educational literature and after appropriate
              modification, implemented into our courses. The experiments utilizing these
              instruments are capturing the interest of the students, integrating
              'cutting-edge' technology into their laboratory experience, and impacting
              student learning for all students, major and non-major alike.
