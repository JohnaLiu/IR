Abstract    :
              Engineering - Electrical (55)

In this project, a novel Remote Wiring and
              Measurement Laboratory (RwmLab) allows students to wire up physical electrical
              and electronics circuits and perform real measurements through internet access.
              In this way, students gain hands-on experience in a real-world laboratory
              environment. This work builds from several recent remote-access laboratory
              projects in Chemistry that received NSF support.

The RwmLab acts as a local
              multi- circuit board on a common distributed panel. A 16- bit data acquisition,
              data processing and analysis, and graphical unit interface enabled device
              characterizes the RwmLab. The multi circuit board contains various electronic
              components such as Power Supplies (AC & DC), Resistors, Capacitors, Inductors,
              Transformers, Diodes (including Zener), Transistors (including BJT, MOSFET, &
              JFET), and Op- amps. The 16- bit enabled device allows the connectivity and
              control of these embedded electronics devices. A data acquisition interface
              allows measurements to be made at important nodes. The data collected at the
              nodes are then processed at the host computer.
 
The laboratory is set up in
              such a way that the student can see what he/ she is wiring on the host PC. All
              activities are PC- based and therefore the student has total control over the
              process of performing his/her experiment without relying on any structured
              steps already pre-designed.
