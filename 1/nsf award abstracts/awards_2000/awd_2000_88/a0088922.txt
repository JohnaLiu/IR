Abstract    :
              The P.I. studies problems in scattering theory.  Some involve
resonances,
              complex numbers which for many problems on noncompact
domains are natural
              analogs of eigenvalues.  Of particular interest to
the P.I. are lower bounds
              on the number of resonances and the
existence of asymptotic expansions of
              solutions to the wave equation
in terms of resonances when there is trapping. 
              The investigator will
also study the problem of determining the asymptotic
              expansion of a
perturbation of a stratified sound speed from knowledge of
              the
scattering matrix at fixed energy.  Another problem of interest
              is
understanding the relationship between the sojourn times of geodesics
and
              the scattering matrix for manifolds with cylindrical ends.

The investigator
              studies questions that are related to wave
propagation.  Resonances can be
              viewed as giving the energy and rate
of decay of waves.  The P.I. studies the
              distribution of resonances
and their relationship to the long-time behaviour
              of waves.  Another
area of interest to the P.I. is inverse scattering theory,
              which
involves recovering information about a an obstacle or
              perturbation
from measurements made "far away" of waves affected by
              the
obstacle.  Taken in a broad sense, this has found many
              applications,
including radar, medical imaging, and underground
              exploration.
