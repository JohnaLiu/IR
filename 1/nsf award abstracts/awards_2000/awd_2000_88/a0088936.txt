Abstract    :
              This RUI award continues research into the collisional interactions of three,
              exotic charged particles.  Calculations on positron/H atom collisions,
              electron/positronium collisions and systems of interest in muon catalyzed
              fusion, will be undertaken.   The PI has been extremely successful in training
              undergraduates in atomic physics.
