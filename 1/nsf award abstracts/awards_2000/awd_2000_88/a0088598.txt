Abstract

The Advanced Electro-Optical System (AEOS) will be
              used to evaluate an instrument and technique for simultaneously collecting
              adaptive optics compensated images in 31 spectral bands.  This instrument is a
              computed tomography imaging spectrometer (CTIS) which maximizes telescope
              throughput to enable simultaneous integration of a 3 dimensional stack of
              images, where the third dimension of the stack is wavelength.  An aperture stop
              is used at the focal plane to define the chief ray for the edge of the field of
              view. The system applies a computer generated, two-dimensionally dispersing
              holographic grating, which produces a 0-order direct image and 1st, 2nd, and
              3rd order images.  Scientific applications include investigations of extended
              regions around symbiotic stars, proto-planetary systems, and identification of
              faint companions.
