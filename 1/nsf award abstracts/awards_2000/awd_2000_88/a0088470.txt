Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)

We are creating and refining materials for a two-course
              undergraduate sequence in the area of e-commerce to meet two nationwide
              educational needs in computer science: 1) the lack of tested course materials
              in the area of e-commerce, and 2) the lack of significant opportunities for
              computer science students to pursue team work in an interdisciplinary
              setting.

The first course covers web technology for computer science majors
              and minors; the second is a unique interdisciplinary e-commer course open to
              students of all disciplines. In the second course, CS students have a different
              set of requirements than non-CS students as they provide technical expertise
              learned in the first course to student teams.
