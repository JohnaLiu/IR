Abstract    :
              Engineering - Civil (54)

In this project, we are developing multimedia
              teaching modules on concrete, steel and wood for a course in strength of
              materials. Modern communication technologies that include interactive
              animations, sound, graphics and virtual laboratories are used to educate both
              undergraduate students and the relevant community (homeowners, building
              contractors, etc.) on the properties and use of concrete, steel and wood. The
              modules feature active learning through interactive animations, electronic
              quizzes and interactive problem solving. Using the Internet, the laboratory
              exercises are made available at remote locations. The benefits of these modules
              include enhanced learning, retention and transfer of learning, and improved
              connection between theory, experiments and applications.
