CRCD:  Modules and Courses for
              Ubiquitous and Mobile Computing

This project educates students in the
              techniques and technologies required to deploy next generation wireless
              information systems. Courses developed for this project focus on ubiquitous and
              wireless computing. And, these same technologies are used in classrooms to
              deliver the curriculum as a part of the project that supports "active
              learning." The areas of research chosen for migration into the curriculum
              include mobile code (placement and migration of code to adapt to rapidly
              changing clients, networks, and service characteristics), transcoding
              (transforming multimedia web content to save bandwidth and thus energy
              consumption at the destination device), active name architectures (where
              resource names are decoupled from specific hosts when resolving services), and
              energy aware operating systems (where the goal is to make basic interactions of
              hardware and software as energy efficient as possible for local computation).
              The project migrates research topics into advanced undergraduate courses and
              graduate courses, developing modules, assignments, software and curricular
              support that engage and educate students in the technologies of mobile and
              wireless information systems. The materials developed are integrated into five
              computer science courses. The courses apply active lectures, a form of active
              learning, to deliver content.
