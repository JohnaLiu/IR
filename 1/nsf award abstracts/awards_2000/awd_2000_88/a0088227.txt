Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12) To enrich the current undergraduate science education, NMR will
              be integrated throughout the chemistry curriculum to engage students majoring
              in chemistry, biology, neuroscience, and other fields. Students will experience
              the discovery of scientific inquiry through investigation of molecular
              structure. Extensive use of NMR will begin early in the organic chemistry
              sequence and will continue through senior student/faculty research. Most of the
              laboratory experiments are adapted from J. Chem. Educ. (JCE) articles or
              NSF-DUE sponsored work. In organic chemistry molecular symmetry and carbon
              substitution will be introduced early via 13 C NMR and DEPT experiments as
              reported by Reeves-JCE'98. Stereoisomers and 19 F NMR will be explored
              according to the combined work of Branz-JCE'85, Piers-JCE'89, and
              Rojas-DUE-9952633. Homonuclear and heteronuclear correlation, as well as NOESY,
              spectra will be used to make proton and carbon assignments. These two
              dimensional experiments will provide hard evidence for spectral assignments in
              labs, which have suffered from lack of student analysis, see Piers-JCE'91;
              Mills-JCE'96; Castro-JCE'98; and McDonald, DUE- 9850423. The instrumental
              methods course will explore magnetic susceptibility and anisotropy, see
              Arnold-JCE'98. Physical chemistry labs will implement variable temperature NMR
              studies for kinetics and thermodynamic determinations based on conformational
              isomers according to Brown-JCE'98 and Dwyer-JCE'98. Mathcad exercises will also
              be employed to help students understand how the Fourier transform process
              works. Senior courses in biochemistry and advanced organic will further utilize
              2D techniques, plus 31 P NMR, for analysis of gramicidin S and adenosine
              phosphates, see Lee-JCE'96 and Craik-JCE'91. Student/faculty research projects
              will likewise benefit from a modern high field NMR. The new instrument will
              include gradient capabilities to drastically reduce acquisition times and a
              higher field strength magnet to improve resolution. A broadband probe is
              essential for several student/faculty research projects. This instrument and
              the revised curriculum will together help to educate students, excite them
              about the power of modern NMR spectroscopy, and prepare them for careers in the
              chemical sciences.
