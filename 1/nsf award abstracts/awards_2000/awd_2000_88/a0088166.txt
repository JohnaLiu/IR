Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12) 

The Department of Chemistry is in the process of
              restructuring the organic chemistry laboratories through introduction of
              Problem-Solving Laboratories (PSL), the addition of microscale experimental
              techniques, and the introduction of modern instrumentation. Use of a new
              Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer is being incorporated into the
              design of new laboratory procedures for two terms of organic chemistry. The PSL
              approach and individual experiments are being adapted from those used at other
              institutions and reported in the chemical literature. The new PSL format,
              facilitated by use of the FTIR spectrometer, is increasing the quality of our
              laboratory instruction by providing a collaborative learning environment,
              allowing students time to design experiments and express ideas, and giving
              students experience with modern instrumentation and techniques. This laboratory
              design provides students with a more realistic experience of chemistry,
              challenging and developing their critical thinking skills, and better preparing
              them to make informed decisions relating to science. It is anticipated that
              this laboratory modification and style will attract more
              students,
particularly women and under-represented minority groups, to the
              study of science. Project results will be disseminated at local chemical
              education meetings, in standard pedagogical journals, and at regional and
              national meetings of the American Chemical Society and/or the Biennial
              Conference on Chemical Education.
