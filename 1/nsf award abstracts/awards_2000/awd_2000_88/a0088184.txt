Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31) 

We are creating a course in User-Centered Design for
              computer science majors. The intent is not to turn computer science students
              into graphics designers, but to provide them with the background and tools
              necessary to enable successful participation in a wide range of projects. In
              particular, web site design offers a key application area for the techniques
              taught in this course. Products resulting from our project are: a textbook,
              instructor's manual and web materials. As well, we are offering workshops as
              the area of user-centered design is new to many faculty. The intent is to
              provide a "turnkey" course for faculty use in this new and underserved area of
              computer science.
