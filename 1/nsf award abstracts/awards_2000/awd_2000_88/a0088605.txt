Abstract    :
              Physics (13) Entanglement of particles is one of the most strikingly
              non-classical features of quantum mechanics and gives insight into the
              questions of quantum measurement and quantum nonlocality. In addition, schemes
              to exploit entanglements have applications in cryptography, communication and
              computation. Due to their high cost, controlled sources of entangled particles
              have historically been limited to the research laboratory. Recently, advances
              in downconversion source efficiency have opened the possibility of generating
              entangled photons at undergraduate institutions. This project will adapt these
              new techniques to the undergraduate physics laboratory to develop a relatively
              low-cost downconversion source. An immediate application of the source will be
              the demonstration of quantum nonlocality by violation of Bell's inequalities.
              This work will actively involve undergraduates at Reed College and will
              introduce into the undergraduate laboratory curriculum concepts and
              technologies from a very active research field. The source that we develop will
              be usable at a variety of undergraduate institutions.
