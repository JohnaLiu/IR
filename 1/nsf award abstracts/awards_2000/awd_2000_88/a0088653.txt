Abstract    :
              Engineering - Chemical (53) 

This project is adapting and implementing a
              Bioprocess Engineering Laboratory (BEL) which is helping to integrate the
              education of science and engineering students and provide them with the
              expertise necessary to be hired by the biotechnology industry. The curriculum
              is an adaptation of that developed at the University of California at Davis
              (NSF ILI-LLD) by Dr. Karen McDonald, with modifications to both the laboratory
              and multi-disciplinary team development components of the curriculum.
              Specifically, the latest developments in process technology utilized by
              pharmaceutical and other biotechnology industries are being added to the
              laboratory course, and additional courses in Microbial Physiology,
              Bioinformatics and Biochemical Engineering are being developed to enhance the
              interface skills between science and engineering students. The objectives of
              the project are to: utilize industry participation to develop the experimental
              components of the BEL; facilitate the utilization of engineering/scientist
              student teams in five courses; develop ten bioprocess engineering experiments
              (for the two laboratory courses); develop five demonstrations for biochemical
              engineering, biochemistry and microbiology courses; assess the effectiveness of
              the BEL in meeting the stated goal.
