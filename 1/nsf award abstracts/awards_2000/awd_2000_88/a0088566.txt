Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12) 
Analytical methods incorporating liquid chromatography (LC) and
              mass spectrometry are an integral part of research in academic, pharmaceutical,
              and industrial research laboratories. While LC/MS is discussed in undergraduate
              analytical lecture courses associated with Instrumental and Quantitative
              analysis, undergraduates rarely obtain any "hands-on" experience with LC/MS
              instrumentation. We are integrating into our undergraduate curriculum three
              laboratory experiments, adapted from the research literature, that utilize
              electrospray ionization (ESI) and LC/ Ion-Trap MS as an analytical component.
              Chemistry majors are introduced to LC/MS in their second semester of organic
              chemistry where they study the reactivity of various amino acids in solid phase
              peptide synthesis. Undergraduate biochemistry students use ESI and LC/Ion Trap
              MS to measure the molecular weight of the protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
              dehydrogenase and the masses of its tryptic fragments. Students in our
              instrumental analysis laboratory compare ESI and Ion Trap MS to ICP-quadrupole
              MS and other analytical methods for the determination of lead in the local
              environment. In addition, undergraduate students are using ESI and LC/ Ion-Trap
              MS in their research projects.
