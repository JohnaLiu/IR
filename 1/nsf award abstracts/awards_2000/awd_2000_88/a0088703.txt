Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)
This project develops materials for an introductory
              statistics class from a sports emphasis. The class covers the basic aspects of
              beginning statistics using examples and datasets from sports. The first
              introductory course is developed based on baseball. A text is developed which
              presents topics from data analysis, probability, and inference from a baseball
              perspective and students learn statistical concepts by working on baseball
              datasets. In the second stage of the project, a text is written focusing on
              applications of statistics to sports. By understanding the benefits of
              statistics in sports settings, the student retain the knowledge of statistical
              concepts and they are able to apply this knowledge to problems outside the
              realm of sports.
