Abstract

Radiometric measurements of Near-Earth Asteroids
              (NEAs) at wavelengths of 0.55 micrometers and 10.6 micrometers are used to
              derive albedos and diameters to refine asteroid thermal models.  NEA
              population's size frequency distribution enables an accurate estimate of the
              population density distributoin.  The origin and evolution of the NEA's are
              derived from these measurements.  This information is critical to our
              understanding of the origins and the evolution of asteroids within the solar
              system provides fundamental research insight into the probability of an
              asteroid striking the earth.  Asteroids striking the earth are now believed to
              have contributed to several very significant changes in life on the surface of
              our planet.  There appear to be three or four times since life first appeared
              on the earth that the effects of asteroids striking the earth have eliminated
              almost all forms of life for thousands of years.  This innovative proposal will
              lay the foundation for future understanding of solar-system
              interactions.

Radiometric measurements are recorfded using the 3.67-meter
              Advanced Electro-Optical System of the US Air Force in this joint NSF/Air Force
              program.
