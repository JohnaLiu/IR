Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)

We are developing NaturalJava, a natural spoken
              language interface for writing and editing Java programs. This system makes
              programming far more accessible to vision and motor impaired students. A unique
              feature of the system is the method of structured editing for fixing errors
              and/or making additions. Spoken language is converted to an abstract syntax
              tree which is displayed. Vision impaired students then access the displayed
              tree via commercial products. The system is being tested with student programs,
              including novices and vision and motor impaired.
