The goal of this project is the development of low-cost
              sensing systems capable of multiple simultaneous analyses of biological
              systems.  These sensing systems will be applied to the electronic detection of
              cell motion and/or cell division which are key indicators of the cell function
              and thus the effect of drugs, cytokines, etc.  Information obtained
              electronically will be used directly or in combination with microscopic
              techniques.  Sensing is based on the use of large-area microelectronic
              fabrication techniques, which will ensure low cost, disposability, redundancy,
              accuracy, and high speed data collection.  A direct interface with digital
              electronics will facilitate rapid analysis and throughput at least an order of
              magnitude higher than existing techniques, leading to improved productivity in
              pharmaceutical and biological research.
