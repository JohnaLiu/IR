Abstract    :
              Engineering - Electrical (55)

This project is developing a Web-based active
              learning toolkit with course modules for undergraduate electronic materials
              coursework. Current applications of the Web to engineering and science classes
              are fairly limited extensions of traditional textbook approaches to learning.
              In contrast, this project builds a framework for developing virtual laboratory
              experiments that address the different learning styles of students, and
              presents information at various levels of abstraction. These virtual
              experiments are integrated with traditional hands-on laboratory experiments in
              a course in electronic materials. The educational challenge is to help
              undergraduates develop intuitions about how electrons move inside a crystal,
              how they interact with each other, and how they are affected by applied
              voltage, light and heat. In contrast to many educational applets, which are
              merely animations of the pages of the textbook, we use simulations based on the
              linear response theory and Boltzmann transport equation. This allows students
              to explore the microscopic origin of many electron transport phenomena without
              understanding the sophisticated mathematics typically covered in an advanced
              graduate course. This technology demonstrates how the Web can be used to bridge
              the gap between lectures and laboratories, reach students with different
              learning styles, and facilitate active learning in a classroom context.
