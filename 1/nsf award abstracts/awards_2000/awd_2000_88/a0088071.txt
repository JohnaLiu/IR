CRCD:  Wireless
              Multimedia Communications for Virtual Environments

This project involves the
              transfer of research from several areas into an unusual curriculum that serves
              upper-level undergraduate and introductory-level graduate students at this
              university. The project integrates concepts from communications, radio
              frequency (RF) and very large scale integrated (VLSI) hardware and software
              design, with virtual environments into an interdisciplinary program that
              teaches students hardware/software co-design. The curriculum (that includes
              three new courses) brings together teams of students and faculty who create
              solutions to complex problems that combine human factors, real-time systems,
              compact wearable computers, and highly sophisticated graphics. The three new
              classes cover software engineering for real-time software, the design of
              practical wireless devices, and the design of virtual environments. The
              curriculum developed in this project continually incorporates advanced research
              topics in virtual reality, sensor design, and wireless multimedia. By providing
              a venue for interdisciplinary work in communications, VLSI circuit design, and
              immersive environments, the curriculum offers coordinated experiences in
              complex system co-design and significantly broadens student skills in this
              area.
