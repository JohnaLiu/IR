Abstract

The AEOS system with its operational
              adaptive optics system will observe a large (186) sample of spectral type O and
              B stars in the I spectral band to detect and characterize multiple stars.  The
              high spatial resolution obtainable with the adaptive optics will enable the
              measurement of magnitude differences as high as 8 in order to investigate the
              mass ratio between the stars within a binary star pair.  With a B0 spectral
              type primary, the detection of an early M star companion is predicted.  Orbit
              determination using double-lined spectroscopic binary information from other
              telescopes and the estimate of the spectral types from the photometric
              measurements made with AEOS will enable an estimate of mass.  These studies are
              important to our understanding of the formation of planetary systems, and
              recycling and processing of gas and dust within galaxies.
