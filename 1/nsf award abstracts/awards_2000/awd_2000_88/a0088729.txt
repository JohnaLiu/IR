Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12) This project addresses the needs of undergraduate engineering
              students. Educational materials are being developed which target materials
              chemistry, the chemistry of energy processes and environmental chemistry. More
              specifically, this curriculum is linked to a theme-based approach that draws
              from real-world examples centered around the ubiquitous automobile. A
              compendium of materials entitled "Chemistry and the Automobile" is being
              assembled to serve as a faculty resource guide to permit other faculty to teach
              their engineering students using this curriculum/theme. It will be made
              available to the chemistry education community at large. This Proof of Concept
              project is intended to show 1) that this curriculum, coupled with the
              overarching theme of "Chemistry and the Automobile," provides a more
              appropriate foundation in Chemistry for engineering students than the
              traditional General Chemistry curriculum; and 2) that the audience is more
              receptive to the subject matter because they see relevance in what they are
              doing. This curriculum/theme is being adopted at the University of
              Michigan-Dearborn to coincide with the launching of a new two-semester General
              Chemistry course specifically for engineering students.
