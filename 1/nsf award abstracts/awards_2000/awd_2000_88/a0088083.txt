Abstract    :
              The genetic basis of differences among individuals is complex yet has many
              important implications for all biological systems. One complicating factor is
              that individual genes can influence more than one feature or trait of an
              organism. This project investigates how these shared genetic associations, or
              covariances, are structured and how they change through time. Theoretical
              population-genetic models will be used to study how patterns of genetic
              variance and covariance change under genetic drift with different assumptions
              regarding the mode of gene action. Such analyses provide the basis for
              comparative studies of the pattern of genetic covariance within and between
              populations.

The genetic processes underlying the function of all organisms
              generate couplings among the features of those organisms that can have an
              important influence on evolutionary change. We currently do not have an
              adequate framework for studying how these genetic associations change through
              time. Understanding these processes is important for explaining the great
              diversity observed among living organisms, as well as more applied pursuits
              such as agricultural selection and the conservation of endangered species.
