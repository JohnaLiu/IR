Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)

General Chemistry laboratories often consist of traditional
              experiments with fill-in-the-blank data sheets. Acquisition of 16 computers,
              each interfaced to a set of Vernier data acquisition probes, will up-grade the
              General Chemistry laboratories with modern instrumentation which will enable
              all General Chemistry students to focus on the discovery of critical concepts
              and the interpretation of data rather than on mathematical algorithms and data
              collection.

The goals of the project are:
1. to increase student interest
              in chemistry;
2. to expose students to modern equipment and techniques at the
              General Chemistry level; and
3. to improve student understanding of concepts
              and develop critical thinking skills. 

Four courses are currently taught at
              the General Chemistry level:
 Chemistry 1040 -Environmental Chemistry, for
              non-science majors;
 Chemistry 1140 - Introduction to General and Organic
              Chemistry, for allied health majors; and
 Chemistry 1145/1146 - Introduction
              to General Chemistry, for science majors.

This diverse group of students,
              representing nearly every academic department on campus and totaling more than
              1000 students for the last academic year, will benefit from early exposure to
              instrumentation and the new focus in the laboratory portion of the General
              Chemistry courses.
