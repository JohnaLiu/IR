Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)
By developing modules which integrate foundational
              mathematical concepts with computer science coursework, we will provide
              students with motivated development in the mathematics required for success in
              computer science. We are developing modules which students work with
              asynchronously at their pace; these modules directly tie mathematics to
              computer science problems. The modules assume only high school algebra, but
              will bring students to the maturity and knowledge level that they require in
              order to succeed. We are adapting peadagogical materials from "Crossroads in
              Mathematics" a report by the American Mathematics Association from the
              classroom environment envisioned in the report to our online, asynchronous
              approach; and curricular materials from two well-established sources: Gries and
              the Math-Thinking Group who have developed a heavily mathematics-based approach
              to computer science education and a text by Aho and Ullman, which emphasizes
              the mathematical modelling of computer science concepts. This project takes the
              mathematical material used in these approaches and ties it to the content of
              early computer science courses.
