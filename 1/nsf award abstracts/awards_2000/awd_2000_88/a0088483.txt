Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12) This project brings a collaborative learning experience to more
              than 800 students per year in organic chemistry laboratories for non-majors at
              the institution. Students participate in three-week collaborative learning
              experiments involving realistic scenarios in which students isolate,
              characterize, and identify an unknown chemical, using a high-field NMR
              spectrometer, and present their findings in a poster session. Students use
              methods employed by natural products chemists in modern laboratories and, as
              part of the identification process, learn to collect and process NMR and FTIR
              data using state-of-the-art instruments. The challenge of integrating a
              hands-on NMR experience into a course serving such a large number of students
              is met by establishing an open instrument laboratory staffed by teaching
              assistants and by developing a WWW-based scheduling system for small-group
              training sessions. The collaborative learning exercises are adaptations of
              approaches published in standard literature and journals.
