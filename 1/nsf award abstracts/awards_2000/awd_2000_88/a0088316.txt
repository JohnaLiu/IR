Abstract

First-light science with a coronagraph
              optimized for the adaptive optics 3.67-meter telescope of the U.S. Air Force
              Advanced Electro-Optics System (AEOS) will be used to detect and characterize
              stellar companions and disks with angular resolutions as high as the
              diffraction limit.  A simple coronograph system is used with the current focal
              plane capabilities of the telescope.  Native Hawaiian students and Maui
              students participate in the observing and data reduction and analysis through a
              two-week undergraduate astronomy program.
