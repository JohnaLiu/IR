The objective of the proposed research is the design,
              development, and evaluation of a new paradigm for chip-scale bioanalytical
              laboratories.  The goal is to uniquely couple the emerging fields of
              magnetically-based analyte labeling, DNA/protein microarray fabrication,
              microfluidic injection, and giant magnetoresistive sensors, forming a new class
              of integrated systems that address the enormous demand for high throughput
              sample screening in the functional genomics and proteomics arenas.  These types
              of assays are also applicable to purity maintenance of public water and food
              supplies.
