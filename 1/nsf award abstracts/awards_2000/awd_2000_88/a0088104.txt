Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12) The goal of this project is to enhance the quality and
              effectiveness of undergraduate instruction and training by incorporating gas
              chromatography-ion-trap mass spectrometry into the chemistry curriculum at the
              institution, using experiments adapted from standard literature. With the
              addition of a single instrument, the chemistry faculty is able to effectively
              educate students in the fundamental applications of mass spectrometry, mass
              spectral interpretation, and "multidimensional" analytical methods such as gas
              chromatography-mass spectrometry and mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. In
              addition, thermochemical concepts are taught in the Physical Chemistry
              Laboratory in an entirely new and easily understood way. The addition of the
              GC-ITMS allows the merging of widely applied and relevant scientific
              instrumentation and technology with chemical education and training. The
              courses affected are Instrumental Methods for Chemical Analysis, Physical
              Chemistry Laboratory and Independent Study and Research. The incorporation of
              GC-ITMS into the curriculum also provides invaluable opportunities for faculty
              development and improvement through the design and implementation of new
              exercises that revolve around bench-top mass spectrometry as a teaching
              tool.
