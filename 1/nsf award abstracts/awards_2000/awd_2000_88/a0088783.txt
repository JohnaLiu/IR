Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99) In 2001/2002, PKAL will sponsor two summer institutes (16
              workshops at each) and a select number of other workshops to enhance the
              skills, understandings and capacities of undergraduate faculty seeking to
              strengthen SME&T learning of their students. Planned and facilitated by leading
              national agents of change, the design of these PKAL activities is to model the
              discovery-based, research-rich, collaborative learning environment that works
              to attract students to and enable them to succeed in SME&T disciplines.
              Benefiting from a hands-on experience with some of the best practices in
              undergraduate SME&T education, participants will leave with an agenda for
              immediate action on their home campuses and with a plan to keep connected to
              their workshop peers/facilitators, regional and national colleagues and to PKAL
              for support in continuing reform efforts. Related PKAL efforts, including an
              expanded web presence, print publications, a consulting service, the Faculty
              for the 21st Century and the evaluation of the impact of PKAL involvement on
              participating individuals and institutions, will support these workshops and
              institutes.
