Over the next three years, an annual conference of developers
              of comprehensive K-12 science and mathematics curricula and national
              implementation sites recently funded by the National Science Foundation will be
              held.  The goal of these conferences is to provide a forum for developers to
              discuss and find solutions to common issues of materials development,
              evaluation, adoption and implemenetation of reform-based curricula.  The
              conference allows the participants to exchange information, interact with
              experts and build relationships begun in previous meetings.  A conference
              report and evaluation is publisehd on the web.  Each meeting builds uon the
              previous one.
