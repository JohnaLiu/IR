Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31)

We are establishing a multimedia/robotics laboratory to
              attract women into the computer information systems major. We believe that
              providing opportunities to construct and observe robots, as constrasted to
              typical pure programming, and to explore the combination of artistic and
              technological skills required in multimedia will be of particular interest to
              women. We are developing activities to use the new laboratory to verify our
              beliefs. We are adapting the laboratory projects created by Susan Fox of
              Macalester College and our multimedia activities are adapted from work by
              D'Arcangtelis, Polack-Wahl and Zaidman and by Ross.
