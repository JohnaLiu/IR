Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Portland State University under the direction of
              Dr. Shu-Guang Li, for the support of a Combined Research-Curriculum Development
              project enttiled, "VIRGE: Virtual Interactive Remediation in the Groundwater
              Environment-An Action Oriented Curriculum Innovation in Environmental
              Engineering. The objective of this collaborative project is to develop an
              innovative, computer-based virtual environment for teaching students how to
              investigate and clean up contaminated groundwater sites. This system is called
              Virtual Interactive Remediation in the Groundwater Environment or VIRGE.  VIRGE
              is to be implemented and evaluated in undergraduate and graduate courses in
              three different academic departments at two universities (Portland State
              University and Oregon State University).  VIRGE incorporates learning theory
              and cognitive-sciences research that promotes student-based learning styles. 
              Using the practical and engaging context of groundwater remediation, VIRGE
              integrates the student's education and research roles, and stresses active,
              collaborative learning with less dependence on lectures.  A key goal of VIRGE
              is to utilize emerging information technologies and network communication to
              develop each student's practical problem solving skills, critical thinking
              abilities, and capability to engage in lifelong learning.
