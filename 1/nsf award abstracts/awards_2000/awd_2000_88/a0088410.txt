AbstractAEOS

The Advanced Electro-Optical System
              (AEOS) of the Air Force with the adaptive optics system will be used in
              conjunction with an available CCD imaging system equipped with special purpose
              interference filters to observe sub-arc second features in Io's escaping
              atmosphere.  Specifically, the PI plans to accomplish 1.  Map the structure of
              Io's escaping atmosphere, 2.  Identify the finest spatial structures in the Io
              plasma tours, and relate them to the torus supply and transport processes and
              3.  Make the first simultaneous observations of atmospheric escape and volcanic
              activity on the satellite surface.  Observations will be made at the following
              wavelengths:  766 nm, 953 nm, 673 nm, 630 nm, 589 nm.

Jupiter is the largest
              planet in the solar system.  Many of the observations of planets outside our
              solar system are of objects similar to Jupiter.  It is important that
              astronomers understand our solar system's planet Jupiter and its satellites as
              part of understanding the formation of planetary systems and thus the origins
              of the solar system.  Io is a satellite of Jupiter and of significant interest.
               It is close enough to the giant planet Jupiter to suffer significant tidal
              forces that sustain a liquid core and cause significant volcanic activity on
              the surface.  Ionized particles are observed to stream from the satellite into
              Jupiter.  This work will aid our understanding of the interaction of gravity
              fields between two bodies, the chemistry of planet and satellite formation and
              the interactions between charged particles and magnetic fields.
