Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the University of Arkansas for the support of a
              Combined Research-Curriculum Development project entitled, "Incorporating
              Recent Developments into the Mixed-Signal/Telecommunications Curriculum," 
              under the direction of Dr. H. Alan Mantooth.  This project has the following
              four major objectives: 1) to substantially transform and evolve the
              mixed-signal and telecommunications curricula at the University of Arkansas; 2)
              to better prepare graduates for careers in mixed-signal and telecommunications
              related fields; 3) to have a national impact on the education of mixed-signal
              and telecommunications engineers, and 4) to establish an innovative model for
              new course creation that facilitates the incorporation of ongoing research and
              encourages widespread dissemination.
