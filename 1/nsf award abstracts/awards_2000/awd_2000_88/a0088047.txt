This award supports a two year project to address fundamental
              questions about the mass and energy flux through Lake Vostok, a subglacial lake
              in East Antarctica, sealed beneath almost 4 kilometers of ice.  The project
              will involve developing lake circulation models, complemented by the analysis
              of new ice penetrating radar data over the lake and surrounding regions.  This
              project will help to accurately define the regions of melting and freezing
              within the lake and help to provide an improved estimate of the form of the
              lake.  The combined data analysis and modeling effort will provide a critical
              framework for developing international plans to sample the waters of Lake
              Vostok for biota and to recover sediments from Lake Vostok for paleoclimate
              studies.
