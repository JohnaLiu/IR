Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61) .
While the techniques of biotechnology have become
              quite standard, the application of biotechnology to solve "real world" problems
              is widely diverse and sophisticated. Unfortunately, the exposure most students
              have to biotechnology during their academic career is largely theoretical and
              is incorporated into lecture courses rather than laboratory courses. Those
              techniques that are taught in laboratories tend to be routine and lack
              connection to contemporary research topics of interest to students. This
              project is focused on adapting the techniques of biotechnology to the special
              needs of agricultural biology and wildlife management. The animal science
              curriculum will be expanded to include investigative, hands-on laboratories
              centered around wildlife management, animal tracking, selective breeding,
              pathology and disease, clinical animal pathology, small animal management, and
              dairy and livestock improvement. The establishment of a student molecular
              biology laboratory will also increase the number of students participating in
              laboratory courses taught in collaboration with Thomas Jefferson University and
              researchers from the Thomas Jefferson Center for Biomedical Research located on
              the Delaware Valley College campus.
