Abstract    :
              Atmospheric Sciences (41) Understanding transport in the Earth's stratosphere is
              an important foundation for atmospheric science. Transport in the stratosphere
              plays a crucial role in determining the seasonal and spatial distributions of
              many trace gases in the atmosphere. The intrinsic complexity of the atmosphere
              precludes the exclusive use of analytic solutions. As a result, numerical
              models are standard tools for studying the atmosphere. This project is adapting
              the Atmospheric and Research 'short" numerical modeling program for use as an
              educational tool to teach undergraduates how trace chemicals are transported in
              the atmosphere. Subsequently, an accompanying set of 8 lesson plans will be
              developed, which will provide a framework of how the software can be used. The
              model provides hands-on experience simulating transport in the stratosphere
              with the ability to compare model results to satellite and other observations.
              The AER "short" model is a mature Fortran code developed in the early eighties
              with funding from NASA, Air Force and industry and has been continuously
              improved through its applications in scientific research in the past 15 years.
              It is one of five models that were developed and maintained by institutions in
              the United States and have remained active over the past 15 years.
