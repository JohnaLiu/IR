	The proposed work is an attempt to use radar altimeter data
              and synthetic aperture radar data in an interferometric mode from ERS-1 and
              ERS-2 to develop a barotropic model of the ocean tide under the Ross Ice Shelf.
               A 30-kilometer resolution model will be applied to the entire Ross Ice Shelf,
              while a higher resolution (30 meters) model will be developed for a 100 square
              kilometer section of the shelf edge.  One expected result of this work is an
              improved location of the southern grounding line of the Ross Ice Shelf.
	Ocean
              tides play a significant role in the complex interactions between the
              atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and floating glacial ice shelves. Tidal currents
              creates turbulent mixing at the bottom of the ice shelf contributing to the
              creation of rifts for the possible detachment of part of the icebergs and can
              influence heat transport between the ice shelf and sea water.   The primary
              scientific objectives of the proposed investigation include: (1) the
              development of methodologies to diminish the tidal aliasing limitations and to
              use repeat-pass synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) and radar
              altimeter data from ERS-1 and ERS-2 for the determination of a fine resolution
              (30-50 m) barotropic ocean tide model in the South Ross Sea region,  (2) a
              coarser resolution (30 km) barotropic ocean tide model covering the floating
              ice shelf region of the Ross Ice Shelf, (3) the assessment and quantification
              of errors associated with the resulting tide model, and (4) provide a
              demonstration of improved determination of grounding line between grounded ice
              and ice shelf in the South Ross Sea.  The approach will make use of the
              convergence of ERS ground tracks over the southern Ross Sea and the overlapping
              of SAR swaths to attempt to break the tidal aliasing. The resulting model will
              be validated for its accuracy and applied to a test case of its potential
              improvement in the detection of grounding lines in the South Ross Sea Ice
              Shelf.
