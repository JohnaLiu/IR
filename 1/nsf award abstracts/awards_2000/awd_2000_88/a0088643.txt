Abstract

This award will support research to determine
              sites of cloud formation of Titan, and from detection of clouds determine the
              tropospheric wind field and set limits on the frequency of methane rainfall. 
              It will use adaptive optics and four filters to resolve Titan spatially and
              analyze atmospheric effects spectrally.  The main goal is to obtain the first
              images of Titan's methane clouds and follow their evolution and motion over
              time scales of hours to weeks.  Six observing nights are awarded to accomplish
              this, with supporting funds for instrumentation (filters), travel, and
              publications.
