The WebBook project demonstrates the feasibility of
              using the Web to deliver next-generation, inquiry-based, active learning
              educational resources. A prototype "hypertextbook" blending standard text,
              graphics, interactive animations of key concepts, voice, and sound into a
              seamless whole is developed and formally evaluated. Standard Web-site creation
              technologies are used to ensure that the prototype can be used with any of the
              usual Web browsers on all platforms, making it accessible to anyone in the
              world without the need to purchase special software or hardware. The prototype
              encompasses the basic topics in theory of computing. As key concepts are
              encountered, animations are presented in seamless fashion that allow the
              learner to explore the concept while controlling parameters that drive the
              animation. The prototype is designed to serve as a general model for the
              development of hypertextbooks, inspiring the creation of similar resources in
              other science and engineering disciplines.
