Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)

As part of a continuing effort to improve the laboratory
              experience of chemistry majors, Raman spectroscopy is being incorporated into
              the undergraduate, upper-level laboratory curriculum with the purchase of an
              instrument that combines the optics for Raman, fluorescence, emission, and
              absorption spectroscopy with CCD camera detection. Although somewhat sparse,
              experiments focusing on Raman spectroscopy are being adapted from the research
              and educational literature and are being implemented into the physical
              chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and instrumental analysis laboratories, with
              each emphasizing a different aspect of the theory and use of Raman
              spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy is already presented in the lecture portion of
              these courses but prior to this award, no instrumentation to illustrate its
              applications in the laboratory was available. Recent advances in instrument and
              detector design have made Raman spectroscopy more valuable in industrial and
              research laboratories, providing a strong motivation to make undergraduate
              students knowledgeable about the technique. Laboratory experience with Raman
              spectroscopy is not common in most undergraduate laboratories so the
              experiments being adapted and implemented are likely to be transportable to
              other undergraduate programs.
