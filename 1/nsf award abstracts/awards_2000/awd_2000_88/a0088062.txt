Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)

The overarching goal of this project is to provide all
              students with a research-rich instruction and learning environment, to enhance
              student interest in and increase excitement about learning and practicing
              chemistry and to strengthen the students' problem- solving skills. Experiential
              learning is enhanced by (a) increasing early exposure to FT-NMR spectroscopy in
              courses for science majors; (b) giving every science major extensive, direct
              experience with FT-NMR instrumentation; (c) integrating research opportunities,
              using a comprehensive variety of experiments, into the chemistry curriculum;
              and (d) integrating FT-NMR, along with other instrumental techniques, into at
              least one course for non-majors that focuses on molecular structure and
              reactivity. Purchase of an Anasazi Instruments EFT-60 system to complement an
              existing high-field, multinuclear FT-NMR spectrometer and use of experiments
              adapted from standard literature allow hands-on instrumentation use by science
              majors at all levels. A course designed for non-science majors also includes a
              research-rich, hands-on laboratory component using the newly acquired
              instrumentation. A workshop for local high school teachers and talented high
              school students is offered, during which participants have the opportunity for
              hands-on operation of the FT-NMR spectrometers. This exposure to
              instrumentation at the high school level results in better preparedness for the
              college-bound science student, increased interest in pursuing a science-related
              career, and an increased excitement among students about science in general.
