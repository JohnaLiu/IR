Abstract    :
              Physics (13) The laboratory part of an introductory physics class can help the
              students gain a better understanding of basic physical concepts and how these
              concepts are described mathematically. This project is revising the
              laboratories for the first- semester course for students who do not plan on
              going into the physical sciences or engineering to better accomplish these
              goals. It is adapting major parts of the Real Time Physics laboratories for
              students at the College. In these laboratories the data are displayed
              graphically on a computer while they are being taken, and this allows the
              students to make a mental connection between what is going on in the experiment
              and its mathematical description. This makes the course a more enjoyable and
              profitable one for the students and leads to lower attrition rates. While the
              Real Time Physics laboratories are very good, there is still room for
              improvement. The project is introducing topics which are not covered in these
              laboratories, such as elementary error analysis, and additional exercises which
              enable the students to better understand the physics of the experiment. The
              project is based on success with these improvements in another physics class
              which is taught at Hunter College.
