Abstract    :
              This award funds a three year Combined Research-Curriculum Development (CRCD)
              program, entitled "Curriculum in Genomic Engineering," at Columbia University
              under the direction of Dr. Edward F. Leonard.  The overall objective of this
              project is to develop and operate a course track in Genomic Engineering that is
              related to research activities in genomic engineering undertaken by the project
              faculty and their colleagues at Columbia University.  The proposed course track
              is designed to provide a broad understanding of the central ideas and goals of
              genomic science in an efficient manner.  The course track will encrouage the
              comprehensive focusing of current engineering knowledge on core problems in
              genomic science and engineering.  Broad exposure of engineering and computer
              science students to genomic science and engineering will encourage sustained
              commitment to the field and the development of well-founded and broad-reaching,
              rather than anecdotal or tactical, solutions to problems in genomics.
