Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61) Chemistry (12) Due to the nature of doing molecular
              biology at a primarily undergraduate institution, there are several challenges
              faculty face in providing students with the training they need to compete
              successfully for jobs in the growing biotechnology industry and the training
              required to perpetuate this knowledge to future generations. These challenges
              include limited funding, space, and time. This project supports the development
              of a shared interdisciplinary molecular facility that will be used in
              undergraduate and graduate level courses in Chemistry and Biological Sciences,
              individual student research projects, and summer research experiences for
              talented middle school children. The facility enables the integration of
              state-of-the-art molecular techniques into the curriculum of over 14 courses at
              the California State University, Sacramento (CSUS) including those for
              prospective K-12 teachers. Over 52% of the students at CSUS are represented by
              minorities. Additionally, most of the CSUS students are "non- traditional" - in
              their mid to late 20s, and work an average of 25 hours a week while attending
              college. Use of this facility enables CSUS students, through course-centered,
              inquiry-based projects, to learn cutting- edge technological methods that
              significantly raises their preparation for entry into careers in biotechnology
              and science education. The project is an adaptation of a similar facility
              developed with NSF support at California Polytechnic State University, and
              adapts research methods from the primary research literature.
