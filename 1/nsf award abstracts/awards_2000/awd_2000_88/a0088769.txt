Abstract    :
              Computing - Other (35) 

This project develops curriculum and supporting
              materials for a course in experimentation for senior computer science majors.
              The capstone course provides students with opportunities to explore issues
              experimentally, design realistic experiments, collect data and draw conclusions
              based on the results. Experimental exploration, the centerpiece of the
              traditional scientific method, can provide new insights, eliminate unproductive
              approaches and validate theories and methods. The course materials are centered
              around a textbook that has two types of chapters, content chapters that develop
              experimental design concepts and project chapters that apply these concepts to
              particular problems. The project chapters are in the form of paper case studies
              or simulation. This approach provides a much needed introduction to computer
              science research in the undergraduate curriculum. The most extensive projects
              are based on simulations of different aspects of computer system performance,
              because this venue allows the student the most flexibility in forming and
              testing hypotheses. Interactive simulations are written in Java and run through
              a standard browser. The materials are disseminated through presentations and
              workshops at computer science conferences and via the Web.
