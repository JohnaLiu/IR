Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)

The Department of Chemistry at St. Mary's College of Maryland
              is developing a more learner-centered curriculum that is supported by
              appropriate pedagogical practices and technological tools. Inquiry-based
              laboratory experiences adapted from both the research and educational
              literature are viewed as an essential element of this effort. The department
              has purchased a 300 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer that is being used to support the
              departments on-going efforts to incorporate inquiry-based laboratory work into
              the chemistry curriculum. With access to the FT-NMR, additional experiments are
              enhancing courses where inquiry methods have already been introduced and are
              allowing the incorporation of inquiry activities into additional courses. The
              set of inquiry-based experiments in the General Chemistry courses are being
              modified to include an exploration of atomic structure using the FT-NMR.
              Inquiry activities using the FT-NMR are also being introduced in the organic,
              inorganic, and advanced spectroscopy courses. Students are incorporating the
              use of routine FT-NMR for the characterization of products synthesized in their
              laboratory work. In subsequent courses, they are using sophisticated techniques
              such as COSY, DEPT, HETCOR and pulse sequences. As a graduation requirement,
              all students are now required to complete a year-long student research project,
              the St. Mary's Project. The FT-NMR is especially useful to many students as
              they explore various aspects of chemical structure and reactivity.
