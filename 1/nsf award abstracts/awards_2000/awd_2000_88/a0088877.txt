Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59) 

An overview of solid waste management is an
              important component of most undergraduate civil and environmental engineering
              curriculum. The solid waste field encompasses a wide range of principles
              derived from mechanical engineering, economics, optimization, chemistry,
              mathematics, hydraulics, hydrology, geotechnical engineering, etc.
              Traditionally it is taught using a combination of lectures, homework exercises,
              engineering design experiences, and the very occasional field trip. However,
              the concepts involved are best grasped through actual experience with the
              processes. 

This project is enhancing learning of engineering principles and
              fundamentals through the development of supplementary electronic/digital
              teaching materials. Specifically, we are developing a compact disc containing
              video and audio clips, slides and other visual aids demonstrating management
              strategies for municipal solid waste, and providing students with hands-on
              learning experiences responsive to diverse learning styles. In addition, we
              have formed a collaboration among the College of Engineering and Computer
              Science, College of Education, and K-12 at-risk schools to engage students in
              learning about MSW management.

The compact disk will also be made available
              to engineering programs adopting a new text, Solid Waste Engineering, through a
              distribution plan to be arranged with Brooks/Cole, Inc.
