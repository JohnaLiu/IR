Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12) Cooperative learning, guided inquiry, and problem-based learning
              strategies are introduced into the upper-level chemistry lab courses starting
              the analytical chemistry lab course. Experiments using low-cost PC-driven
              UV-visible spectrometers, a spectrofluorometer, and a capillatry
              electrophoresis instrument are adapted from standard literature and implemented
              using a guided-inquiry and project-oriented instructional format. Program
              effectiveness is assessed through a process using external evaluators as well
              as through student group self-assessment and exit questionnaire forms.
