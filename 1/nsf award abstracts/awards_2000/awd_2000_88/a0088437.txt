Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59) 

This project is an integrated effort by the Faculty
              of Engineering to develop effective methods for teaching engineering from an
              applied, multidisciplinary point of view. The project adapts the well-proven
              pedagogy of "reverse engineering", and implements this strategy for the study
              of the human body, an exquisite combination of interacting systems that can be
              analyzed using multidisciplinary engineering principles. We have developed a
              series of eight hands-on modules that introduce chemical, mechanical, and
              electrical engineering principles through application to the human body.
              

The goals of this project are to: 
(1) Engage students in the scientific
              discovery process via exploration of the engineering systems within the human
              body using exciting hands-on "reverse engineering" methods. 
(2) To introduce
              all of the proposed modules into the multidisciplinary Freshman Engineering
              Clinic course which is required of all freshmen at Rowan University.
(3) To
              integrate the modules vertically into courses in the Chemical, Mechanical, and
              Electrical Engineering curricula, and the Health Sciences Department.
