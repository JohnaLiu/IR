Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the University of Maryland-College Park under the
              direction of Dr. John Baras for the support of a Combined Research-Curriculum
              Development project in Systems Engineering. Educators at the Institute for
              Systems Research at the University of Maryland along with partners from
              industry and a publishing company will develop, widely disseminate, and
              evaluate an information-centric systems engineering curriculum.  The curriculum
              will include three graduate level courses, graduate systems certificate courses
              and industry short courses.  The strategy throughout these courses will be to
              enable multi-disciplinary development and communication through appropriate
              information abstractions/representations.  Students will employ sophisticated
              algorithmic, mathematical and quantitative methods implementable in modern
              software environments.
