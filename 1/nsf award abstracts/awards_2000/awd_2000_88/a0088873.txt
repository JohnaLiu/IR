Abstract    :
              Engineering - Engineering Technology (58) 

Programmable logic controllers
              (PLCs) are an essential part of manufacturing
automation. Thousands of these
              devices have been used in manufacturing plants for such
applications as
              monitoring security, managing energy consumption, and controlling
machines and
              automatic production lines. However, because of limitations in
              equipment
availability, it is often difficult for students to gain the
              experience needed to become
proficient with PLCs.
This is a proof-of-concept
              project to develop an integrated virtual learning system for
programmable
              logic controllers. The system is initially being utilized as
              an
instructional/laboratory aid within the Manufacturing Engineering
              Technology program
at Texas A&M University. This system is integrating the
              strong educational emphasis of an intelligent tutoring system with the
              technological innovation of a PLC emulator and the attraction and motivation of
              a game. Each component is being developed and evaluated both internally and
              externally. Evaluation criteria includes instructional effectiveness and lesson
              content appropriateness. Results are being disseminated within the academic and
              industrial communities via the Internet. If the concept is proven, the
              methodology will be replicable and applicable to several other types of
              equipment and technical laboratory courses.
