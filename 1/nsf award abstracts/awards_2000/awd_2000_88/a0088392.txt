Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99) 
The Colleges of Ceramics and Liberal Arts and Sciences
              at Alfred University and Alfred State College of Technology are extending their
              interactions through a multi-institutional and multi- disciplinary
              collaboration. An extended materials characterization laboratory is the support
              mechanism for the collaboration. The project is adapted from the "Extended
              Physical Chemistry Laboratory" project that has been established between the
              University of South Carolina at Spartansburg, Wofford College, and Converse
              College (NSF DUE 9950296, NSF DUE 9452453 and NSF DUE 9751605). The goal of the
              project is to promote interaction between materials science, chemistry,
              geology, and environmental science for students and faculty through shared
              laboratory modules specifically designed to fit into each curriculum. Students
              with different educational backgrounds are working in problem solving
              situations in a team setting. The project challenges students to be organized
              in their interpretation and communication of data. The newly developed
              laboratory modules are based on experiments utilizing a remote sensing fiber
              optic module for Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, a simultaneous
              thermal analyzer (STA), and a gel permeation chromatography unit.
              Cross-disciplinary experiments are being developed based on examples of other
              NSF funded programs such as the Incorporation of Environmental Sciences with
              Chemistry (NSF DUE 9551773 and NSF DUE 9950832), which are being extended to
              include materials science. Materials science students are being combined with
              chemistry students in one classroom, similar to the program at Oberlin College,
              which set up a program to introduce materials thermal analysis into their
              chemistry laboratories (NSF DUE 9980925).
