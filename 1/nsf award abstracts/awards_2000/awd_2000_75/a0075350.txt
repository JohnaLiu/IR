Ecosystems in transition: Causes and
              consequences of dramatic shifts in growth form dominance

Worldwide, the
              structure and function of many ecosystems are in transition due to global
              changes in climatic means and extremes, increased atmospheric CO2, nitrogen
              deposition, alterations in land management, and the spread of invasive exotic
              species. In the tallgrass prairies of the eastern Great Plains, the expansion
              of shrub cover and forest encroachment into this grassland is a widespread
              phenomenon. This is a serious conservation concern since tallgrass prairie is
              considered an endangered ecosystem. The objective of this project is to use a
              tallgrass prairie ecosystem to evaluate the patterns, mechanisms and ecological
              consequences of transition to closed-canopy shrub/woodland. We will test
              hypotheses regarding the role that resource availability plays in woody plant
              expansion in grasslands. Evaluating this grassland-to-shrubland transition at
              levels from the leaf to the landscape will provide both the mechanistic
              specificity, as well as the large-scale generality, required for successful
              conservation efforts.
