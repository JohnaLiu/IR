This award to University of California San Diego provides
              shipboard technical support, shore-based support, as well as maintenance and
              calibration of shared-use scientific instrumentation, for researchers using
              four oceanographic research vessels, all operated by the University's Scripps
              Institution of Oceanography.  The four vessels operate as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. The
              technical support awarded here will assist NSF-funded researchers conduct a
              diverse suite of oceanographic studies from these four vessels throughout the
              world oceans, beginning in 2000.
