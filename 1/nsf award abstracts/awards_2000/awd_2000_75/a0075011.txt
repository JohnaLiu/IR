Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research study is to collect and analyze the stories of
              Native American teachers-in-training.  The teachers-in-training are
              participants of a United States Department of Education funded bilingual
              program on the Omaha Reservation School, Macy, Nebraska.  This research project
              focuses on the stories of these Omaha Native American teachers-in-training. 
              Their stories will describe their experiences and perceptions teaching and
              learning elementary science in the Reservation school.  Stories will be
              analyzed to explain the nature of science as told in the stories of the
              teachers-in-training on the Omaha Reservation school.
