LTREB: Energy flow and climate control:  A program for
              continued long-term research at Castle Lake, CA

The Castle Lake long-term
              research program is one of the longest running programs of its kind in the
              world, with a continuous data set spanning more than 40 years since 1958. This
              study focuses on how energy in the form of carbon flows from primary producers
              (phytoplankton)to consumers (zooplankton) and eventually to fish, and on what
              determines the efficiency of energy flow in aquatic ecosystems in relation to
              year-to-year variability of climate forcing.  In particular, the investigators
              will study which primary producers are nutritious to zooplankton and how
              year-to-year differences in climate affect the energy transfer processes in a
              lake ecosystem. These long-term studies will provide information useful to
              understanding how lake ecosystems might be altered by future climate
              change.
