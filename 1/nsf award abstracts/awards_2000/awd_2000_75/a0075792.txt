An adaptive computing
              system (ACS) offers a revolutionary combination of the performance of custom
              hardware and the flexibility of software by employing reconfigurable
              technology.  A key feature of an ACS is the reconfigurable processing element,
              which, in the current generation, is a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)
              chip.  This research project investigates the impact of an ACS in the context
              of a high-performance computational grid with clusters-of-workstations, shared
              memory multi-processors and rapid interconnects.  Suites of fast estimators are
              devised using approximation algorithms for FPGA mapping and partitioning. An
              assortment of algorithmic methods is applied.  A major focus is on new
              heuristic and optimization strategies designed to exploit emergent mathematical
              techniques.  Supporting software tools are also developed, with an emphasis
              placed on portability.  Implementation testbeds are built around edge-based
              segmentation and related problems common to a variety of image processing
              applications.
