Abstract    :
              This POWRE award to Dr. Phyllis Leber will allow her to supplement a sabbatical
              leave from Franklin and Marshall College to extend her repertory of mechanistic
              probes of organic chemical reactions. She will learn dynamic isotopic dilution
              kinetic procedures in the laboratory of John E. Baldwin at Syracuse University
              and apply these techniques to a study of substituent effects in organic
              chemical rearrangement reactions at Franklin and Marshall College.
