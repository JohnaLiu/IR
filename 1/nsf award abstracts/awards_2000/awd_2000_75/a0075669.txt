Effects of plant functional identity on ecosystem
              nitrogen retention following fire

Recent warming trends and increased human
              activities have led to documented increases in fire occurrence in North
              American boreal forests.  Forest productivity in the boreal biome is generally
              limited by the availability of nitrogen (N), and increased fire frequency
              causes increased opportunity for N to be lost from the ecosystem via combustion
              and post-fire losses to the atmosphere and water.  Understanding controls over
              these N losses following fire is important for predicting the long-term
              consequences of increased fire frequency for forest productivity and carbon
              cycling.  In this proposal, the investigators hypothesize that the functional
              traits of the plant species that initially colonize burned ecosystems will
              control the ability of the ecosystem to accumulate carbon and thus retain N
              following fire.  The researchers will test this hypothesis with a study of N
              loss in a boreal black spruce forest that burned in June 1999.  The research
              approach will entail an ecosystem-scale addition of a stable N isotope that can
              be tracked, combined with experimental manipulation of plant colonization.
