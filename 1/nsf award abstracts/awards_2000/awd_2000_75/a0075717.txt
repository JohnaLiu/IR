Abstract    :
              This project has as its aim the development of methodology that couples normally
              incompatible early and late transition metal catalysts, to perform multistep
              catalytic transformations.  In particular, early transition metal Lewis acid
              catalysts will be coupled with late transition metal redox catalysts to enable
              one-pot transformations.  Since such catalysts cannot normally coexist in
              solution, they will separated by immobilizing them onto solid organic supports.
               To achieve stereoselective catalysis, polymerizable chiral ancillary ligands
              will be examined in addition to a molecular imprinting approach.

With this
              Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program's Organic Synthesis
              Program supports the research of Professor Michel R. Gagne of the University of
              North Carolina, Chapel Hill.  Professor Gagne's research involves the use of
              metals as catalysts to bring about useful organic reactions.  Since several
              kinds of metal catalysts are used in a variety of ways, Professor Gagne is
              working to develop strategies whereby more than one catalyst can be employed
              concurrently in a single reaction vessel.  This will significantly increase the
              efficiency with which synthetic products can be produced in a laboratory or
              industrial setting.
