The Eighth FASEB Summer Research Conference on Folic Acid,
              Vitamin B12 and One Carbon Metabolism  will be held under the auspices of the
              Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) from August 5
              through August 10, 2000, at Snowmass Village, Colorado. This conference offers
              a unique opportunity for scientists from a broad group of disciplines but
              united by a common interest in folic acid, vitamin B12 and one carbon
              metabolism, to interact both formally and informally. Scheduled every other
              year, the last seven conferences have been fully subscribed. The program
              includes well-established scientists as well as those just entering the field
              and topics covering the entire spectrum of research in these fields. In
              addition to the formal presentations, the program will be complemented with
              poster sessions and workshops. The meeting is structured to allow graduate
              students and postdoctoral fellows, as well as established scientists, an
              opportunity to present and discuss their work. The funds provided by the
              National Science Foundation will be used for travel awards for graduate
              students and postdoctoral fellows presenting outstanding posters.
