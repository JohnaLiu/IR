The P.I. proposes a project to explore
              the role of soil communities on invasive and native plant species in southern
              California.  She will test two potential mechanisms of soil community dynamics
              that may influence establishment of exotics. The first mechanism, the
              degradation of mutualists hypothesis postulates that exotic species have
              reduced dependence on soil mutualists and therefore do better in the face of
              disturbance.  The second mechanism, the escape from pathogens hypothesis
              suggests that exotic species are freed of their native soil pathogens, thereby
              facilitating their establishment.  The PI and collaborator Bever will conduct
              green house experiments in which they will monitor the growth of plant species
              in pots inoculated with a range of soil communities.  As a POWRE awardee, the
              PI will continue outreach activities to undergraduate students as part of her
              effort to enhance the number of young women scientists and to enhance the
              scientific knowledge of Women's Studies students.  This will advance the PI's
              career by allowing her unique exposure to new tools and allow her to return to
              field biology after some time away.
