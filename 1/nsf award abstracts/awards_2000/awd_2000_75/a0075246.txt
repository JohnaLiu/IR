Abstract    :
              This project focuses on the study of a newer area of aromatic chemical research,
              metallabenzenes, transition metal analogues of benzene in which one of the
              methine units has been replaced by an isolobal transition metal fragment.  The
              chemistry carried out in this project takes advantage of a method that allows
              direct entry into the metallabenzene manifold using a cyclopropane precursor. 
              One goal of the project is to demonstrate that this method provides a general
              synthetic route to metallabenzenes and valence isomers.  This represents the
              first comprehensive investigation of metallabenzenes where ligand, ring
              substituents, and transition metal centers will be systematically
              varied.

With this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program's
              Organic Synthesis Program supports the research of Professor Michael M. Haley
              of the University of Oregon, Eugene.  Professor Haley's research interests are
              in the incorporation of transition metals as integral parts of otherwise
              all-carbon systems.  In particular, modifications of the structure of benzene
              will be undertaken.  Benzene is the prototype structure of an important class
              of chemical structure referred to as possessing aromaticity, and the effect of
              carbon-metal substitution will be carried out to explore its effects on
              aromaticity.  In addition, a variety of new organometallic structures will be
              prepared whose properties are heretofore unknown.
