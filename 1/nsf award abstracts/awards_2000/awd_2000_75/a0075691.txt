This workshop will attempt to identify fundamental and applied
              research issues associated with very large construction and manufacturing
              systems in space and/or on the moon.  Such issues will arise in connection with
              the assembly of solar power satellite systems (which may require the use of
              hundreds of autonomous, free-flying robots) and with the manufacture of
              photo-voltaic systems on the moon.  The proposed workshop will concentrate on
              the system issues, including control, intelligence, cooperation, and
              self-replication.  Partial support for the workshop has been obtained from NASA
              Headquarters.
