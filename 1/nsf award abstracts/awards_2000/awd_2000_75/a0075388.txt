Abstract    :
              One hundred and forty years ago Charles Darwin proposed the theory of evolution
              by natural selection.  This theory has been remarkably successful in explaining
              both the diversity of species of plants and animals and the intricate fit
              between organisms and their environment.  One of the great puzzles remaining
              for evolutionary biologists is the evolution of sexual dimorphism - differences
              between males and females of the same species in size, shape, and coloration. 
              Divergence of populations in sexual dimorphism cannot be explained by standard
              evolutionary theory.  The research proposed will test the hypothesis that
              change in dimorphism of adults is the result of changes in the growth and
              development (ontogeny) of males and females. To test this idea the
              investigators will study sex-specific growth patterns of recently established
              populations of the house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), a small
              songbird.

This will be the first study of the role of growth and development
              in evolution of sexual dimorphism in natural populations of vertebrates.
              Ultimately, this work will provide significant new data and insight into our
              understanding of how the morphologies of males and female evolve. More
              generally, these data will increase our understanding of the processes that
              enable rapid colonization by invasive species and, thereby, aid conservation
              efforts.
