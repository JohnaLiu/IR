Abstract    :
              This award provides support for Ph.D. graduate students and new investigators in
              the International Society for Bayesian Analysis attending the Sixth World
              Meeting, ISBA 2000, held 28 May - 1 June 2000 in Hersonissos, Crete.  More than
              125 talks by over 200 presenters, and three poster sessions, are planned on the
              themes of Official Statistics, Public Policy, and Governmental Statistics. 
              This conference brings together academic and applied Bayesian statisticians
              throughout the world, many of them recent Ph.D.s or current Ph.D. candidates,
              due to the demographic consequence of the rapid growth of the Bayesian
              statistics.  The award funds are primarily devoted to defraying the expenses of
              graduate students, new researchers, and members of underrepresented groups from
              the U.S.  Partial support is provided from the Division of International
              Programs.
