An award is made to the Northeastern University for the
              acquisition of state-of-the-art low-temperature ultra-high-vacuum (UHV)
              scanning-probe-microscope. Fluctuations in properties on a length scale
              somewhat larger than atomic scale are increasingly important in complex
              materials such as glasses, polymers, proteins, ceramics, and small devices. 
              These mesoscopic scale fluctuations are believed to arise because molecules
              must rearrange cooperatively, an important but poorly understood phenomena
              occurring in many systems. Nanoscale cooperativity will be directly studied in
              various complex materials using powerful new nanoscale spectroscopies which
              require a state-of-the-art low-temperature ultra-high-vacuum (UHV)
              scanning-probe-microscope. Through cooperative and experiential education
              programs, undergraduates will participate in research with this
              state-of-the-art instrument, gaining valuable nano-science experience and
              enabling them to contribute to important nano-technologies of the future.
