The Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS) is an organ of
              the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, established to foster research
              collaboration between universities and research institutions in the US and the
              humid tropics. A focus of CTFS is to document the abiotic and historical
              biogeographic correlates of tree species diversity in biodiverse lowland
              tropical forests, consistently expressed on the three tropical continents. The
              patterns revealed will facilitate formulation of explanatory hypotheses for the
              maintenance of biodiversity, testable by experiment. Aided by computer
              simulations , the impact of timber harvesting and other human interventions on
              tree species diversity is being predicted, and will be tested in associated
              research including logging experiments. There are six core study plots in Asian
              tropical forests and this proposal seeks funding to re-census these plots.
              Dynamic data forthcoming from four already established plots will enable the
              investigators to document changes in forest dynamics along abiotic gradients of
              regional scale, notably  rainfall seasonality, for the first time. Two of these
              four plots experienced unprecedented droughts since their previous census;
              analysis will here yield base-line data on the impact of climate change on
              biodiverse tropical ecosystems.
