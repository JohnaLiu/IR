Darwin did not understand how reproductive barriers between
              new species could evolve.  After all, it is hard to imagine how natural
              selection alone could regularly result in the evolution of maladaptive traits
              like the premature death or sterility of hybrid offspring.  Today it is
              understood that chromosomal rearrangements (or underdominant loci) and
              epistatic interactions between loci can cause hybrid sterility.  These
              alternatives invoke vastly different evolutionary processes, so differentiating
              between them is a fundamental step in understanding the origin of species.  The
              proposed research will test for the action of chromosomal rearrangements and
              genetic interactions in causing the partial hybrid sterility observed in
              crosses between the wildflower species Mimulus guttatus and M. nasutus.  The
              projects use mapped genetic markers to isolate chromosomal segments from each
              species in the heterospecific genomic background, and test their fitness in
              common garden experiments.  The number, effects, patterns of expression, and
              genetic basis of individual incompatibility factors will be determined.
              

These experiments address fundamental issues underlying the evolution of
              hybrid sterility, and so will contribute to our understanding of how new
              species originate.
