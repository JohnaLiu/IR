This award provides support for the travel of U.S. graduate
              students and post-doctoral fellows to participate in the Gordon Research
              Conference "Lasers in Medicine and Biology". Support is being provided
              primarily on the basis of research merit, however special consideration is to
              be given to applicants involved in biomedical engineering laser research.
              Selection of awardees will be by vote of the conference and session chairs
              based on information provided by applicants in response to the requirements in
              the application form. The form is to be sent by email to directors of all laser
              research laboratories plus graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in those
              institutions. 

This Gordon Research Conference is one of the most useful
              meetings in the emerging fields of photomedicine and biomedical optics. The top
              research groups in this field are represented in the program. The major goal of
              the conference is to bring together key researchers from academia, industry and
              government to examine the future applications of lasers and the optical
              sciences in medicine. The graduate students and post-doctoral fellows that will
              be supported by this grant will benefit greatly from participating in this
              excellent meeting and listening to the talks given by the top researchers in
              the field. One of the valuable features of this meeting is the large amount of
              time devoted to discussion time in the informal atmosphere which lends itself
              to valuable interaction among the participants.
