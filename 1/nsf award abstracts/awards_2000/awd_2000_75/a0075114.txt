Collaborative Research:  Alternative carbon sources for lake
              food webs

Most ecosystems are viewed as driven by photosynthesis deriving
              from plants within the system's boundaries.  Lakes in particular are textbook
              examples of how algae and aquatic plants support food webs including fish. 
              Yet, plant production is often a poor predictor of fish and invertebrate
              production.  Ecologists have long known that lakes receive significant inputs
              of organic matter from their watersheds. Recent work demonstrates that this
              terrestrial organic matter is potentially available, suggesting terrestrial
              organic matter may be significant in supporting lake food webs including top
              carnivores.  This project will address this question by a series of whole lake
              additions of a stable isotope of carbon which will produce a strong contrast in
              isotopic composition between terrestrially-fixed carbon and carbon fixed by
              aquatic plants.  Through a combination of stable isotope addition experiments
              and  computer modeling, this research will provide an ecosystem-level test of
              the importance of the connections between terrestrial organic matter and
              aquatic food webs.
