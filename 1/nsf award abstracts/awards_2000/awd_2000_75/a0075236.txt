European earthworm species have recently begun to invade
              hardwood forest ecosystems in the northern United States.  Many of these
              forests have thick forest floor layers that serve as the rooting medium for
              forest herbs and tree seedlings.  Exotic earthworms consume the "duff" layer,
              sometimes leaving exposed mineral soil.  Although there is significant concern
              about the potential loss of native forest plant species and ecosystem
              stability, little is known about how plant communities and ecosystems respond
              to invasion by detritivores (detritus-feeders).  The overarching hypothesis of
              the study is that earthworm invasion will have cascading effects on soil
              characteristics and forest-floor vegetation, and that resilience of the
              community will depend on site productivity and interaction with deer grazing. 
              This study will employ deer exclosures, field studies, and experimental
              manipulations to determine rates and patterns of change in earthworm
              populations, assess effects of earthworm species on forest floor and understory
              vegetation, identify factors affecting vegetation recovery following
              establishment of earthworm populations, and examine earthworm impacts across a
              site productivity gradient.  This study will lead to increased understanding of
              the process of invasion by exotic animal species and will have significant
              implications for forest management and restoration.
