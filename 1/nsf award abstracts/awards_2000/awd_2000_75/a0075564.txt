ABSTRACT 

#DEB0075564 

Soil harbors a tremendous
              diversity of microbes, most undiscovered.  A key component to understanding the
              extent and patterns of this biodiversity is whether or not there are
              geographically unique populations.  Century old dogma states that free-living
              bacteria are globally dispersed since microbes can be transported by wind,
              birds and humans.  We propose to reevaluate this principle since understanding
              whether geographic population patterns exist is important to a number of basic
              and applied issues ranging from understanding biological diversification, to
              ecological roles, to quarantine, to new strategies for pharmaceutical
              discovery.  We propose to test the bacterial endemism hypothesis using our
              existing collection of an important soil bacterial group (fluorescent
              Pseudomonas).  These isolates are from undisturbed soil taken from 200m
              transects, at five different sites in each of six different continental
              regions.  We propose to evaluate the degree of endemicity using a suite of
              molecular methods that will provide a continuum of genetic resolution of the
              population.  The hypothesis will be supported if genetic distance increases
              with geographic distance, and if the phylogenetic analysis of genes shows
              geographic clades.
