Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding for the development of decision support technologies
              for e-market intermediaries.  The Phase I focus will be on an intermediary
              model that matches a given set of demands to a set of supplies, e.g., to
              inventory or capacity across a set of production facilities.   Four primary
              tasks will be required: (1) data representation specification (i.e. supply and
              demand); (2) intermediary architecture development; (3) matching algorithm
              development;  and, (4) prototype implementation.  Due to the Phase I time
              restrictions, these tasks will be initially adopted for the paper industry. 
              The prototype will be based on an Internet application in order to ensure rapid
              implementation and easy demonstration.  

If successful, the primary benefit
              of this research will be the development of an enterprise approach that can
              achieve economies of scope attempted in ERP systems, but without the
              limitations of inflexibility and poor scalability.  The enterprise intermediary
              will allow for multi-attribute search and decision support functionality that
              provides both the buyers and the suppliers with the ability to build dynamic
              supply chains and to make best use of this extra flexibility. The trading
              system will bring value to the participants by lowering the cost of
              transactions, improving manufacturing efficiency, and improving the business
              process.
