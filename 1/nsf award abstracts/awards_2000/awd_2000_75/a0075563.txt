This project examines the underlying role of abiotic stress,
              as expressed in a one million-year successional gradient of soil development
              and a 100-year record drought, in explaining local and regional patterns of
              outbreaks in a keystone insect herbivore. First, the investigators hypothesize
              that scale herbivory will decrease across a one million-year successional
              gradient of young to old volcanic soils under the same climatic regime. Second,
              they hypothesize that new scale outbreaks are created in response to pulse of
              drought and that scale populations are less stable than high stress sites that
              suffer chronic attack.  The combination of both new outbreaks and chronic
              infestations of pinyon needle scale provides the basis for a series of
              experiments that are designed to increase our understanding of the factors that
              promote and maintain insect outbreaks.  These factors will be examined through
              intensive population studies comparing incipient outbreaks and chronic
              infestations, as well as reciprocal transplant experiments of soils and plants.
               These studies represent a critical opportunity to integrate a million-year
              successional gradient, chronic stress and acute stress events to explain
              spatial and temporal dynamics of an outbreak species that has expanded during a
              recent drought to become a regional problem.
