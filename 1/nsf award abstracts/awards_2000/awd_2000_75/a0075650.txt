Integrating linkages among aquatic and
              terrestrial landscape elements

This research is designed to determine where
              in complex landscapes important chemical transformations of various ecological
              materials occur. Studies will follow water from the time it falls as rain along
              its path from small rivulets to large streams. These pathways include landscape
              features such as upland soils, intermittent and permanent streams, and stream
              side (riparian) zones populated by mature trees. Increases or decreases in
              materials transported between landscape patches will be related to production,
              release, or retention within patches. The PIs will perform this research in the
              Sonoran desert of Arizona, an ecosystem that responds dramatically to variation
              in climate, especially rainfall and temperature. Emphasis will be on the
              movement of nitrogen, which is increasing in landscapes worldwide due to human
              activity. Results of this research will aid in identifying and managing
              critical ecosystem components for maintenance and enhancement of water quality.
