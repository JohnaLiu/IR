Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, addresses questions of interfacial chemistry in electrochemical
              devices.  Using a combination of surface vibrational spectroscopies,
              electrochemical methods, and electron spectroscopic probes, Professor Pemberton
              and her research group at the University of Arizona study the structure and
              properties of three types of important electrochemical interfaces.  The
              orientation of diakylcarbonate solvents at model Li battery electrode surfaces,
              the interfacial chemistry of dialkylimidazolium salts used in electrochemical
              capacitor systems, and the interaction of organic thin films with low work
              function metals are examined in this work.  Fundamental questions about
              interfacial structure and reactivity are studied, with an eye towards the
              technological applications of this information.

The understanding of the
              interfacial chemistry in important electrochemical systems is the goal of this
              research project.  A combination of experimental probes are used to address
              questions of electrolyte structure at the electrode interface, the interfacial
              interactions of organic dielectrics in capacitor systems, and the interfacial
              chemistry important in organic light emitting devices.  Results of this
              fundamental research impact a number of important microelectronic technologies.
