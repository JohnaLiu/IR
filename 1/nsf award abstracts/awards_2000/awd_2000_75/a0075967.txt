Abstract    :
              Why organisms reproduce sexually instead of asexually is one of the outstanding
              problems in biology.  Recent models suggest that, under higher dispersal rates
              of asexuals relative to sexuals, asexual organisms may persist for three
              reasons: escape from parasites (Red Queen hypothesis); relaxed selection
              against deleterious mutations; or local adaptation of asexuals to marginal
              environments. Using diploid sexual and asexual Campeloma limum, a freshwater
              snail from the southeastern US, this proposal outlines molecular and
              experimental field tests of these hypotheses.  Using sequence variation in a
              mitochondrial gene (cytochrome b) and a nuclear intron (calmodulin), we will
              assess whether asexuals have higher dispersal rates than sexuals.  We will also
              test unique predictions of the three models by field experiments.  

Because
              plant pathologists, epidemiologists, and conservation biologists realize that
              host genetic diversity plays an important role in the spread of diseases, the
              results from this study will be of considerable to these scientists.  These
              results will also be of considerable interest to evolutionary biologists,
              because the study will provide critical tests of ecological and evolutionary
              causes of the spatial distribution of sexual and asexual organisms.
