Drs. Heather M. Wilson, Jerome C. Regier and
              Jeffrey W. Schultz of the University of Maryland have been awarded a grant to
              study the evolution of millipedes (Class Diplopoda).  The millipedes are one of
              the most diverse groups of animals, with more than 8,000 species. They are
              important components of terrestrial ecosystems and appear to have been so for
              over 400 million years. Nonetheless, the role of millipedes in the  life
              history of our planet is not well understood. The project detailed here will
              resolve the evolutionary relationships (phylogeny) of the millipede orders
              through extensive original analyses of muscular anatomy, fossil morphology and
              DNA sequences. This project has four main objectives: (1) to survey the
              skeletal muscles; (2) to examine the skeletal anatomy of fossilized species;
              (3) to comparatively sequence the DNA coding for three nuclear protein-encoding
              genes (elongation factor-1a, RNA polymerase II and elongation factor-2); (4) to
              use these data, separately and in combination, to infer the phylogeny (family
              tree) of millipedes and their relatives. This work is unusually
              interdisciplinary in that it represents a collaboration of specialists in
              paleontology, comparative anatomy and molecular genetics. This integrative
              approach to millipede phylogeny promises substantial insights into the
              evolutionary biology of a large, important group of organisms and will produce
              and permit the integration and analysis of data of three very different types
              to address a single question.
