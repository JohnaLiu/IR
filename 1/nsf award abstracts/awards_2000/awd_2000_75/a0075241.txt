"21st Century ionospheric research using the Cornell
              University portable radar interferometer"

Swartz, Wesley E., Cornell
              University

This award addresses the application of a portable interferometer
              VHF radar (known as CUPRI), presently located in Puerto Rico, to the study of
              geomagnetic field-aligned irregularities in spread F and sporadic E.  This work
              would be a continuation of the present series of observations combined with
              analysis directed to the understanding of the causative factors underlying the
              formation of these irregularities.  These ongoing measurements would be
              supplemented with coordinated campaigns with the Arecibo Observatory incoherent
              scatter radar observations of the winds of the lower thermosphere region.  This
              award would also undertake significant upgrades of the data acquisition
              component combined with field tests with the aim of improving the temporal and
              spatial resolutions of these observations.   Further analysis of the Brazilian
              set of measurements would be undertaken to compare equatorial results with
              those obtained in Puerto Rico.
