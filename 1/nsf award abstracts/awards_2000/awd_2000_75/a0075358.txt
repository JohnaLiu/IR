Abstract    :
              
Microorganisms that grow within or upon leaves alternate between a life cycle
              phase associated with the leaf, a transport phase in the atmosphere, and growth
              on another leaf of the same or different plant species. This project seeks to
              explain, both by mathematical models and experimental tests, how a resident
              population of microbes can be elevated synergistically by the influx of
              relatively small numbers of immigrant microbe cells to the leaf. The models
              will be tested by examination of natural and experimentally enhanced levels of
              a yeast- like fungus, Aureobasidium pullulans, on apple leaf surfaces. The
              field tests will be facilitated by use of molecular marker methods, which allow
              the background population of A. pullulans to be discriminated from the
              introduced immigrant population.

This project has two significant scientific
              implications. First, it may help explain how populations of species survive and
              compete in nature in isolated patches when the number of immigrants is small
              relative to the size of the extant population. Second, microbes inhabiting
              leaves cause important plant diseases. These pathogens share many of the
              features of A. pullulans. Therefore, this system should give greater
              quantitative insight into the biology and epidemiology of microbial plant
              diseases.
