Introductions of exotic species are one of the major ways by
              which humans affect ecosystems globally. Exotic species have been shown to
              change the chemical and physical properties of ecosystems, as well as their
              species composition. Nevertheless, our knowledge of how invasive species
              interact with ecosystems is still incomplete. An important problem with many
              studies of invasive species is that they are done soon after the species
              arrives. The results of such short-term studies may be misleading if the system
              shows transient dynamics or if the system is driven by factors that vary from
              year to year, and which interact with the invader. Both of these circumstances
              are common in real ecosystems.
	This LTREB project will explore the transient
              and long-term response of the Hudson River ecosystem to the zebra mussel
              invasion. This group has been observing the Hudson ecosystem since 1986. Zebra
              mussels appeared in the Hudson in 1991, and soon caused dramatic changes to the
              phytoplankton, zooplankton, bacteria, zoobenthos, light quality, nutrients and
              dissolved oxygen in the river. Over the last few years, evidence has begun to
              appear that some of the observations made in the early years of the invasion
              may be transient responses, and may not represent the long-term response of the
              Hudson River to the zebra mussel invasion. The overall objective of this
              long-term study is to determine if the interaction between the invasive species
              and the ecosystem is changing significantly, and if the short-term response of
              the ecosystem adequately represents its long-term response. This work will help
              to define the roles of the zebra mussel and other bivalves in aquatic
              ecosystems, advance our understanding of large river ecosystems, and elucidate
              the interactions that occur as an invasive species and an ecosystem accommodate
              one another.
