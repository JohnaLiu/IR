Phase Transitions, generic scaling, and universality in systems
              far from thermal equilibrium are comparatively poorly understood.  Yet, many
              analytic and computational studies are based on simplified theoretical models,
              the only justification for which is the existence of universality classes. 
              This theoretical grant aims to advance the current understanding of genuinely
              non-equilibrium systems via two different but complementary approaches, namely
              (i) through studying simple fundamental models, and (ii) by analyzing specific
              experiments.

In (i), field-theoretic representations and the renormalization
              group will be used.  The equilibrium critical dynamics universality classes
              will be analyzed to determine how they are affected by violating detailed
              balance conditions.  The effects of spatially anisotropic noise on the dynamics
              will be studied.  The influence of noise correlations will also be studied.  In
              (ii), a variety of non-equilibrium physical conditions will be analyzed.  These
              include light-emitting polymers; the dynamics of driven magnetic flux in
              disordered high temperature superconductors;  complex biological reaction
              systems; the physics of dehydrated organisms which may be in a metastable
              glassy thermodynamic state.  Work will also continue on teh writing of a
              graduate textbook on critical dynamics.

This grant supports theoretical
              research on foundations and applications for a variety of non-equilibrium
              systems.  This is a field of research which affects many common systems; life
              itself is a non-equilibrium system.  The study of systems in equilibrium is
              much more advanced, whereas the understanding of non-equilibrium systems is
              still in a formative phase.  Systems to be studied include light-emitting
              polymers, high temperature superconductors, and various biological
              systems.
