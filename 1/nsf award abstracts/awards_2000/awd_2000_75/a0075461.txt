Most recent approaches to understanding host-pathogen
              interactions assume that host-pathogen population dynamics and host-pathogen
              co-evolution are separate subjects. Moreover, host-pathogen co-evolution is
              often assumed to be about pathogen virulence, rather than about host resistance
              or true co-evolution. In previous research on the interaction between gypsy
              moth and its virus, however, the PI has collected data showing that host
              variability in resistance to the virus plays an important role in gypsy moth
              outbreaks, and the preliminary attempts to model this system have suggested
              that the evolution of resistance may drive gypsy moth outbreaks. Thus, it seems
              likely that the evolution of resistance and fluctuating population densities
              are key to understanding the interaction between the gypsy moth and its virus,
              while the evolution of pathogen virulence may be important largely because it
              helps to maintain variability in host resistance. This research will
              investigate the following questions: Does host resistance drive population
              outbreaks in the gypsy moth? How is variability in host resistance maintained?
              The approach to answer these questions will be to document changes in host
              resistance and pathogen virulence in several outbreaking gypsy moth
              populations, during the period while these populations are collapsing because
              of virus epidemics. In addition, we will quantify additive genetic variability
              in virus resistance in the gypsy moth, to understand the potential for
              evolutionary changes in this insect. Also, we will explore whether
              host-pathogen specificity and/or fitness tradeoffs in host and pathogen can
              help to maintain host resistance. This will serve to unite the two previously
              disparate fields of population dynamics and evolutionary dynamics, and may shed
              light on strategies to manage this pest insect.
