Abstract    :
              The Near East is currently poor in developed annual resolution proxy records of
              climate extending back into pre-industrial times. This award will fill this gap
              by establishing reconstructions of past climate in the region using tree rings.
              In order to do this, the principal investigators will: (1) develop new
              tree-ring chronologies for the region; (2) examine interrelationships and
              correlation among the chronologies; (3) study the effect of climate on
              tree-ring growth; and (4) develop tree-ring reconstructions of climate over the
              past several centuries for this region.
