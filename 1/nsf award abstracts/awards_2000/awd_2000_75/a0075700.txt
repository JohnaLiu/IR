	The cone-bearing plants or conifers, including pines, firs,
              junipers, cypresses, and relatives, number in the several hundred species of
              living plants, disposed in 60 or so genera, and are the surviving members of an
              evolutionary lineage that dominated terrestrial environments in the Mesozoic.
              Genealogical relationships among these surviving groups are not yet firmly
              established, although gene sequence data are accumulating for many
              representative taxa. Dr. Linda Raubeson is contributing new structural genomic
              data to help answer questions about the phylogenetic relationships of conifers.
              In particular, she is studying the content and order of genes in the
              chloroplast genome of a sample of 20 or so genera of conifers, and including
              the likely related ginkgo and gnetophytes. Fine-scale restriction-enzyme
              mapping of mutations along the chloroplast genome will reveal changes in gene
              order (inversions or translocations) and gene losses or duplications, some of
              which have already been characterized in her laboratory. Most of these
              structural mutations are of rare occurrence, and are likely to mark groups of
              phylogenetically related genera, thus providing new evidence for taxonomic and
              classification studies. The chloroplast genome maps, in turn, will aid more
              detailed studies of species-level relationships in taxonomically problematic
              groups, either by gene sequencing or yet finer scale restriction-enzyme
              mapping. Throughout the project, as in past work by Dr. Raubeson, undergraduate
              students will participate in discrete activities targeted to provide them
              training in modern molecular phylogenetic methods and experience in the design
              and execution of a research activity.
