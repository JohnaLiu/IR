This
              award provides funds for the continued operations of the Univ. of New Hampshire
              meteor radar over a two year period to monitor continuously the dynamics of the
              mesosphere and lower thermosphere.  These observations would be studied to
              improve our understanding of planetary dynamics, tides and gravity waves as a
              part of the global task force organized to collect and analyze jointly these
              observations.  The objectives of this study would be the investigation of
              temporal and spatial variability of the mean, planetary and tidal components
              through intersite comparisons.  A particularly interesting difference in the
              approach that would be used compared with the normal mode of analysis is the
              plan to carry out common volume measurements between the UNH meteor radar and
              the incoherent scatter radar facility of Millstone Hill.  Magnetic storm
              effects and continued climatological studies of the wind field are secondary
              objectives of this effort.
