The effects of rainfall exclusion on an Amazon
              forest

Droughts increasingly threaten the world's major tropical
              rainforests. El Nino episodes cause severe drought and widespread forest damage
              by fire. In this project, the investigators are looking into the future of the
              Amazon rainforest by experimentally excluding rainfall from a one-hectare (2.5
              acre) patch of forest in Brazil. This experiment will determine how much
              drought the rainforest can tolerate before its trees begin to lose leaves, stop
              growing and reproducing, and die. The researchers will also be investigating
              how drought affects the role of the rainforest in the changing chemistry of the
              atmosphere. It is no small task to exclude rain from a rainforest. The project
              upon which this research follows hired 26 laborers for a year to build a wooden
              frame containing 6100 plastic panels held 2-4 meters above the forest floor.
              Gutters carry the rainwater away from the site. The project also built 8 towers
              into the forest canopy, 10-stories above the ground, to monitor the physiology
              and dynamics of leaves. In addition, shafts 3-stories deep were dug to study
              soil water and roots.
