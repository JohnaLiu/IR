Abstract    :
              The Gordon Research Conference "Organic Structures and Properties," to be held
              June 17-22, 2000 at Connecticut College in New London, Connecticut is devoted
              to extend organic systems, their structures, and the properties that ensue from
              that organization.  Areas to be discussed include organic thin films,
              electronic and optoelectronic materials, biomolecular materials, crystalline
              pharmaceuticals, and novel supramolecular systems.  It is anticipated that this
              conference will provide a unique opportunity for developing the strong, but
              often unrecognized, connections between two-dimensional assemblies (thin films)
              and three-dimensional bulk solids, as well as the principles of molecular
              recognition and assembly that permeate all the session topics.  One evening has
              been reserved exclusively for five "Young Investigators".

Solid-State
              Chemistry continues to have a direct impact on the technological advances in
              areas such as the design of solid-state organic materials for optoelectronics,
              ferroelectrics, and biomolecular materials.
