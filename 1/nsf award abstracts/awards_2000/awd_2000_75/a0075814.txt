Instrument readings in process plants may
              be corrupted by the presence of biases and leaks.  Data reconciliation is done
              to obtain process variable estimates.  The accuracy of the data and the quality
              of the information are related to the algorithms used as well as the sensor
              network used to filter these disturbances.  Because plants are usually poorly
              instrumented for the purpose of data reconciliation, good redundancy is not
              available to perform this function.  

This project involves research in
              cost-optimal sensor location.  Numerical procedures will be developed for large
              systems.  Network performance measures will be addressed: residual reliability,
              residual resilience, multiple gross error detection capability, etc.  Work will
               also be done for the case of dynamic data reconciliation and for nonlinear
              systems.  An extension to cover the design of sensor networks capable of
              handling normal monitoring tasks such as accounting and parameter estimation,
              simultaneously with the detection and isolation of faults, will also be
              addressed.
