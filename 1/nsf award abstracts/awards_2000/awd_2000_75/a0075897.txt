Abstract    :
              
The project will provide an ethnographic account of one of the U.S.
              Immigration and Naturalization Service's immigration detention facilities and
              the immigration court it contains.  Through interviews and extended observation
              of individual cases, the project will document the legal theories held by those
              at the facility, including the detainees, executive branch immigration judges,
              lawyers and guards.  The project will examine the extent to which these legal
              theories are isolated from the main currents of U.S. public law.
