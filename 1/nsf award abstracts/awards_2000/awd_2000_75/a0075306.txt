Living rodents comprise about one half of all extant mammals - a
              total of over 2,000 species classified into about 32 families. Resolving the
              evolutionary relationships among these families has resisted over 100 years of
              study, primarily using morphological characteristics.  Previous studies of
              rodent phylogeny using DNA sequence data have resulted in only minimal
              resolution of deep relationships. This study will both increase the number of
              rodent and non-rodent species examined and substantially increase the amount of
              DNA sequence data per species, compared to those previous DNA sequence studies.
              Over 5,000 base pairs of DNA sequence data will be collected, from portions of
              five different nuclear protein-coding genes from 46 representative rodent
              species and 14 non-rodent outgroups. The study is designed to maximize cohesion
              with other, ongoing studies of mammalian phylogeny, of both deeper
              (inter-ordinal) and more recent (intra-familial) divergences. Data obtained
              will also be used to address several aspects of one of the most fundamental
              questions in molecular evolution: how and why nucleotide and protein sequences
              change over time. Three specific hypotheses will be tested: 1) changes in
              protein structure can convert nucleotide positions that were previously
              invariable into positions that can be varied; 2) the primary determinant of the
              rate of molecular evolution is generation time; 3) natural selection on
              translational accuracy is capable of causing non-random usage of synonymous
              codons. The tests of all three of these hypotheses are thoroughly integrated
              with the phylogenetic aspect of this project. Rodents, by virtue of their rich
              species diversity and access to many different nuclear gene sequences, are
              perhaps the best model system with which to address these important
              evolutionary process questions.
