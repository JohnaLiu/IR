Abstract    :
              0075989
The research aims at developing a continuum formulation reflecting the
              coupling between composition and mechanics in polycrystalline solids.
              Electromigration effects are also included. The motivation is to model the
              evolution of microstructure, which can lead to failure of metal lines in
              integrated circuits. Composition, mechanics and electric fields interact via
              lattice-level mechanisms in a thermodynamic formulation from which the coupled
              field relations are derived. General initial and boundary value problems
              reflecting the complexity of phenomena such as diffusion creep, hillock
              formation, grain boundary motion, void formation and evolution can then be
              posed. The project will also develop computational methodologies to solve the
              resulting system of coupled partial differential equations.
