Long-term Biogeochemical Changes in China's Anthropogenic
              Landscapes

This study will measure long-term changes in the biogeochemistry
              of carbon, ni-trogen and phosphorus (C, N, P) across the densely populated
              agricultural village landscapes of China.  The pre-industrial (~1930) and
              current state of five 5 x 5 km landscape scenes representative of China's
              agricultural regions will be measured by combining high-resolution satellite
              imagery, World War II aerial photography and precision land surveys with
              material sampling, household surveys, elder interviews and historical
              resources.  Current and pre-industrial measurements will then be compared to
              examine the relative impacts of changes in landscape structure, popu-lation
              density, agricultural practices, and fuel combustion in driving long-term
              changes in C, N and P storage and flux across each site.  Integration of field
              meas-urements with regional and remotely sensed data will improve the accuracy
              of global biogeochemical change estimates across one of the most rapidly
              developing areas of the world, demonstrating field and statistical tools for
              the study of anthro-pogenic ecosystems.
