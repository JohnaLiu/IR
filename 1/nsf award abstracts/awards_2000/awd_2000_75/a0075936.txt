	The main objective of the Gordon Research Conference on Nuclear
              Chemistry is to provide the international community of nuclear scientists with
              a unique forum in which the newest developments at the forefront of this
              science can be presented and subjected to detailed and extended discussions and
              criticism.  The purpose of the conference is to encourage communication and the
              discussions to be conducted in an atmosphere conducive to open interactions
              between the scientists, provoking new and even speculative ideas for future
              research.
	To accomplish these goals requires the participation in all of
              the
conference activities of a significant number of leaders in the
field. 
              However, the field invites and needs cooperative efforts on
all levels with a
              range of expertise for its growth.  Therefore,
younger scientists from all
              countries are encouraged to participate
in the conference and to present their
              ideas.  In particular, in
anticipation of the future need of manpower and of a
              growing
importance of international cooperative scientific ventures,
              it
appears necessary to expose selected advanced graduate students from the
              major international research universities to the new
opportunities and
              techniques in nuclear science.  This award will
facilitate participation from
              these junior scientists.
