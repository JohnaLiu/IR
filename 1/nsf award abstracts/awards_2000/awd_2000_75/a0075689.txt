This award provides partial support for graduate
              students, 
postdoctoral researchers, and persons from under-represented
              
groups to attend a workshop on "Equivariant Stable Homotopy 
Theory and
              K-theory.  The main speakers include I. Madsen, 
J.P. May, W. Dwyer, J.
              Morava, G.Carlsson, I Kriz, P. Hu, 
D. Sinha, R. Mandel, G. Lewis, and J.
              Greenlees, each of 
whom will give a one hour talk.  In addition, there will
              be 
5-10 short talks by participants.  The workshop will be held 
at Stanford
              University in the Summer of 2000.
