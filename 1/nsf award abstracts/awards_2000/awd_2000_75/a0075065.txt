This research project is an exploration of teachers' learning
              in both formal and informal professional development activities; for example,
              scheduled workshop sessions and teachers' conversations about mathematics
              teaching.  All of the professional development is focused on helping teachers
              learn to use children's mathematical thinking as a framework for engaging in
              inquiry.  Data sources include teachers' journal writing, formal interviews and
              audiotapes of both researcher-teacher interactions and teacher-teacher
              interactions (when the researcher is not present).  The PI and the teacher
              participants will all be actively engaged in gathering data about teachers'
              learning.  Data analysis will (a) increase understanding of differences in
              teacher learning across settings and (b) help identify issues related to the
              emergence of teachers as professional development providers.
