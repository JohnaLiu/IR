POWRE: 
              Developing a Research Methodology for Studying Mobile IT Usage and Person
              Mobility

The objective of this work is to develop a new methodology that is
              suitable for evaluating the usage of mobile information technologies, as well
              as person mobility.  The research activity consists of adapting a microcamera
              technology as an evaluation tool.  The project encompasses development of
              specialized coding software and data analysis techniques and development of
              supplementary evaluation tool for an electronic diary.  The system testing will
              involve actual users in the field, obtaining user feedback, analyzing the data,
              and refining the technology and evaluation methodology.
