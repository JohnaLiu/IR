Abstract    :
              This POWRE grant will support a new initiative in the PI's research and
              educaitonal activities.  The PI plans to develop a new program in Nuclear
              Analysis of Materials.  She will develop a setup to measure the distribution of
              oxygen (18) in surface layers of various materials through the detection of the
              nuclear resonance in oxygen at 151 keV.  The development of this technique will
              complement a large array of existing characterization  tool already available
              on campus.  In addition these experiments will be a precursor and test bed for
              a setup to measure oxygen (18) reaction which has a much smaller cross section
              and is of importance for the PI's muclear astrophysics research.  The
              development of an experimental techniques course will allow the PI to expand
              her teaching to the graduate level.  The award is funded by the NSF POWRE
              program, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the MPS Directorate, and
              the Physics Division.
