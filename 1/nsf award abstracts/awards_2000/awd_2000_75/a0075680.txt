This grant provides support for the costs of upgrading
              the computing facilities for crustal deformation research at the Geophysical
              Institute of the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. Along with cost-sharing
              provided by the Geophysical Institute, this grant will provide funds to acquire
              a new server computer and several workstations, as well as laptop computers for
              downloading field data.  The new computers will replace aging  workstations and
              unreliable laptops. The new computers will be used to support an active ongoing
              NSF-supported research program on deformation of the crust in Alaska and Asia,
              using Global Positioning System (GPS) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture
              Radar (InSAR) techniques. The newly-acquired computers will provide a solid
              computational foundation for GPS and InSAR data analysis, and inversion and
              modeling of the resulting data.  In addition to the PI, Jeff Freymueller, the
              equipment will be used by five graduate students (three female), one postdoc,
              and a new faculty member (hiring is in progress).
