ABSTRACT: Using a Trichomycetes (fungus)
              larval Simuliidae (aquatic fly) model, the PI's propose to determine, under
              both field and laboratory conditions, if the nature of these symbiotic
              (co-existing in a close association) relationships frequently shift from state
              to state. Thus, parasitism, commensalism, and mutualism would be merely
              temporary descriptions of species interactions under particular sets of
              intrinsic (fungal infection intensity, host species) and extrinsic
              (environmental) conditions. They suggest that the particular state of this
              symbiotic relationship can be predicted by the environmental conditions under
              which the hosts (the larger  member of a symbiotic association) and symbionts
              (the smaller member of a symbiotic association) are found.  They will also
              examine the dynamics of symbiosis across landscapes.  This will provide the
              unique opportunity to assess the nature of the symbiotic interactions over a
              large spatial scale, and hence determine the importance of geographic structure
              in shaping symbiotic associations and the opportunity to separate factors
              influencing the distribution of each host species from those influencing the
              distribution of each trichomycete species.
