The objective of this research is to establish the
              principles underlying oligomerization of disordered polypeptide chains through
              the zippering of b strands.  Fragments of oxidized E. coli thioredoxin, a
              single domain a /b proteins of 108 residues well studied by fragment
              complementation, provide a unique opportunity to study oligomerization in the
              absence of the fully complementary fragment.  The fragment 1-37 self assembles
              to produce large molecular weight homo-oligomers, and also interacts with
              fragment 74-108 to form hetero-oligomers.  These homo and hetero-oligomers will
              be examined using recently developed solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance
              (SSNMR) methods, as well as complementary biochemical and biophysical standard
              techniques to determine the topology.  Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance
              methodologies are a powerful tool for detailed structural analysis of
              oligomers.   This is a POWRE proposal, for the PI, a leader in studying protein
              recognition by fragment complementation, to collaborate with a colleague in a
              nearby institution who is experienced in  SSNMR, and to learn these techniques.
