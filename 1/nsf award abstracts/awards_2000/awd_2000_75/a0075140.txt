Abstract    :
              This award supports a three day symposium devoted to the topic of multiscale and
              multiresolution methods in computational science. Arguably, multiscale and
              multiresolution methods represent the most important tool in obtaining
              asymptotic scalability of large scale computations and data manipulation.
              Although a well-known paradigm of computation, recent developments in the
              general area of multiscale computation such as, multiscale finite element
              methods as well as new developments in the area of specialized multiresolution
              representations such as curvelets and ridgelets have suggested important new
              application areas for these techniques which will be highlighted by speakers at
              the symposium. Since multiscale and multiresolution techniques are just
              beginning to penetrate diverse areas of scientific computing such as molecular
              dynamics and scientific visualization, one goal of the symposium is to bring
              together as many differing perspectives on the subject as possible with the
              goal and expectation of inspiring new avenues of research and application.
