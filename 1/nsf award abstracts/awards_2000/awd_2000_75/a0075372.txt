The Department of Physics at Southwest Texas State
              University develops and implements a science masters program in Materials
              Physics that will significantly increase the hands-on experience of the degree
              candidates and train them in areas of interest to the regional semiconductor
              industry.  The program includes new laboratory-focused courses, research
              internships within the university and co-op type industrial internships.

The
              university is located in the heart of a high-technology industrial community as
              well as a geographical region rich in underrepresented minority candidates in
              the sciences and engineering.  The project can potentially serve as a model for
              graduate applied physics education.
