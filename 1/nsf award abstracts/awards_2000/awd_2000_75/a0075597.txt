Abstract    :
              The PI recently found ten complete, well preserved, and perfectly articulated in
              situ neck vertebrae of a very large Late Cretaceous sauropod dinosaur in Big
              Bend National Park.  This new find is unprecedented and rivals in size the
              giant sauropods of the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous.  Previously, not
              even a single complete adult sauropod neck vertebra had been found in North
              America from Late Cretaceous rocks and no giant Late Cretaceous sauropod had
              been found anywhere in the world!  Partial excavation revealed individual
              vertebra estimated to weigh from approximately 400 pounds to 1,200 pounds.  The
              three smallest vertebrae were removed on stretchers on the shoulders of four
              strong men.  Five hundred pounds is basically our limit for removal of a
              vertebra by this method.  The only sensible way to remove the remaining seven
              vertebrae from the desert is by helicopter and then loading them onto a truck
              for transportation to UTD where they will be prepared for study and display. 
              The bones have a calcite-rich concretionary coating, which is up to three
              inches thick.  This coating can be removed successfully only by time-consuming
              mechanical means.  It is important that the remaining in situ neck bones be
              removed as soon as possible to limit the possibility of theft or damage,
              including weathering, to this unique and important scientific discovery.
