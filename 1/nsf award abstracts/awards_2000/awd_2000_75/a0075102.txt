Abstract    :

    The objective of this research is to conduct an annual census
              of
seedlings and saplings in a tropical rain forest in Panama, to monitor
              their
annual  growth, survival, and recruitment for 5 years.  We will also
              record
the location and dynamics of all treefall light gaps that open in
              the
forest, because these are the main sites for forest regeneration,
              where
seedling and small sapling dynamics are accelerated. The dynamics of
              this
forest, located on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) in the Panama Canal, has
              been
studied for the past two decades, but thus far seedlings and small
              saplings
have not been included.   These new data will enable us to test
              alternative
hypotheses for how the more than 300 species of trees are
              maintained and
coexist in the BCI forest.  New evidence suggests that
              host-specific fungal
pathogens that kill seeds and seedlings may be important
              agents regulating
tree diversity in the BCI forest.   We will test this
              hypothesis and test
the strength of  density-dependent regulation in the
              seedling and small
sapling community.  We will also test the hypothesis that
              treefall gaps,
interacting with limited seed dispersal, limit the recruitment 
              success of
most tree species in the BCI forest. The work is likely to have
              broader
significance for understanding how tropical forests in general
              maintain high
tree species diversity.
