In this renewal project effort, research into the structural
              aspects, thermodynamics and kinetics of Stranski-Krastanov growth in a binary
              eutectic system is performed. One of the primary areas of interest is to
              understand how such a system behaves as the particle size decreases from large,
              where the bulk phase diagram is applicable, to small where terms such as the
              surface free energy may lead to depression of the eutectic temperature.
              Parallel with this research, work on 'Direct Methods' for determining surface
              structures is performed. The target here is to provide a general code that is
              freely available to solve, ab-initio, three-dimensional surface structures from
              transmission electron diffraction or surface x-ray diffraction data. A new area
              added to the program is charge-transfer at reconstructed surfaces which should
              in principle be detectable and quantifiable using transmission electron
              diffraction. Another area is a precession electron diffraction camera, which
              could become a very important tool in the future for determining structures
              using transmission electron diffraction.

As dimensions continue to
              decrease in electronic devices, there is no reason why metallic materials
              should follow the traditional bulk property behavior.  This research employs
              classic metallurgy, surface science, and small particle science to better
              understand the properties and behavior of thin metallic films.
