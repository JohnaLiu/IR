Abstract    :
              0075289 - Bird and Bird

This exploratory project in evolutionary ecology will
              test a number of hypotheses concerning the factors that influence variability
              in food acquisition and sharing among families and bands of the Mardu of
              Western Australia (hunters and foragers). Individuals vary in the foods the
              acquire and in the ways the distribute goods to maintain social relationships.
              In particular, this project will investigate how men and women use food in
              different ways and for different purposes. The researchers will focus on
              collecting preliminary data on foraging choices, energy return rates, time
              allocation and food distribution patterns, and will test to see if men face
              tradoffs between the benefits that can be had from social signaling and those
              from provisioning. The project will contribute to our understanding of how
              men's and women's work differs, why it differs more at some times than at
              others, and how men and women gain status from the kinds of work they do and
              how they distribute the products of their labor.
