     The investigator uses numerical simulations and
              analytic
techniques related to amplitude equations to study pattern
formation
              dynamics in swimming bacteria, wave number selection in
a Swift-Hohenberg
              equation modeling traveling wave patterns, and
traveling hole solutions of the
              complex Ginsburg-Landau equation.
     The broad topics of pattern formation
              and the behavior of
patterns are widely important in mathematics and in
              application
areas.  The investigator studies the conditions under
              which
certain equations have solutions that show such patterns, and
what
              these patterns say about the underlying physical or
biological problems.
