This award to University of Miami provides shipboard technical
              support, shore-based support, as well as maintenance and calibration of
              shared-use scientific instrumentation, for researchers using four oceanographic
              research vessels.  The vessels include R/V Smith, operated by the University's
              Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, and R/Vs Johnson, Link
              and Sea Diver, all operated by Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution.  The
              four vessels operate as part of the University-National Oceanographic
              Laboratory System research fleet. The technical support awarded here will
              assist NSF-funded researchers conduct a diverse suite of oceanographic studies
              from these four vessels, principally in the western North Atlantic Ocean and
              equatorial Atlantic regions, beginning in 2000.
