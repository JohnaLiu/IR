Abstract    :
              Most multicellular organisms, like humans, form from a single cell.  By
              contrast, the social amoeba forms a multicellular body by aggregating
              individual cells from a small area.  This difference allows the investigators
              to evaluate genetic conflicts within an organism in a system that may prove to
              be an ideal model system for social evolution.  The investigators will
              characterize the genetic variation in cells in a natural habitat, and will then
              investigate how these cells interact when they come together in a multicellular
              individuals.  They will evaluate how often some cell lines dominate over other
              cell lines, forcing them to be part of the sterile stalk instead of the fertile
              spore.  Different cell lineages will be combined in the laboratory and
              evaluated using variable DNA
microsatellite loci.

How cells interact with
              each other is an important question that bears on many fundamental problems in
              biology.  For example, cells that escape the control of other cells and
              continue to divide characterize cancer.  Programmed cell death is an important
              mechanism for ridding an organism of cells in the wrong place or that have
              certain kinds of defects.  When the social amoeba forms a fruiting body, some
              cells die while others live. Understanding the process whereby some cells
              escape the process of programmed cell death, and perhaps force other cells to
              die is of potential relevance to mechanisms for understanding cancer, and human
              developmental diseases.
