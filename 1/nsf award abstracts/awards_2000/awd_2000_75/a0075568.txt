This grant provides funding for investigating fundamental issues
              relating to construction enterprise resource planning systems (Construct-ERP). 
              The major research tasks include exploring suitable architectures for
              Construct-ERP systems, identifying basic features needed, developing methods
              for modeling and standardizing construction resources, adopting algorithms for
              modeling construction products, developing advanced construction resource
              planning techniques, exploring techniques for modeling functional decisions in
              construction, and representing human intelligence in decision-making process. 
              The developed techniques will lead to the prototype of an internet-based
              construction enterprise-wide business automation system.
The system developed
              under this research will assist construction enterprises in optimizing the
              utilization of their internal and external resources to support maximizing the
              achievement of business objectives.  Specifically, the system will enable a
              construction enterprise to best utilize available information to make timely
              business decisions on: 1) how to allocate the enterprise resources (manpower,
              equipment, materials, and money) to the projects on hand?  2) whether or not
              and how to compete for additional resources in the market?  and 3)
              establishment of a strategy for bidding projects and planning for these
              potential projects.  Traditionally construction management research efforts
              have focused predominantly on process/project-level activities because of the
              project-oriented nature of the construction business.  The results of this
              research will help open up new research directions supporting construction
              business automation with integrated back- and front-office functions.
