Abstract    :
              During development of the vertebrate neural retina, multiple neuronal
              cell
types are born and differentiate under the control of a complex set
              of
factors that are poorly understood. To gain a complete understanding of
              the
molecular mechanisms regulating retinal neurogenesis, it is essential
              to
define the hierarchy of genes involved in this process. The goal of
              this
project is to use recently developed transgenic methods in the
              model
organism Xenopus laevis to define which factors control expression of
              the
transcription factor Xath5, a key regulator of retinal neurogenesis.
              The
Xenopus transgenic method provides a unique opportunity to rapidly
              and
inexpensively map the regulatory control regions of
              developmentally
important genes, thus making it possible to define how genes
              come to be
expressed in precise spatial and temporal patterns during
              development.

These experiments will provide a more complete understanding of
              the steps
leading to normal retinal development. In addition, this work will
              advance
our understanding of nervous system development in general, since
              the
retina has proven to be a reliable model tissue for studying nervous
              system
development and function. Finally, the development and application of
              the
new transgenic method in Xenopus laevis will open up many possibilities
              for
future investigation and discovery in the field of developmental
              biology.

It is anticipated that this POWRE award will allow the principal
              investigator to 
travel to learn a novel Xenopus transgenic method and to then
              establish it in her 
laboratory.
