Abstract    :
              The specific objectives of this research are fourfold.  First, a thorough
              investigation of the Co(0) catalyzed Pauson-Khand reaction will be carried out
              with emphasis given to ligand control of the relative and absolute
              stereochemical outcome of ring formation.  Second, ligand control of asymmetric
              Rh(I) catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition processes will be studied.  Third, the
              rational design and synthesis of structurally differentiated, enantiopure
              P-chiral phosphine ligands will be carried out.  Fourth, the ligands will be
              evaluated in asymmetric bond forming reactions including Ir(I) catalyzed
              hydrogenations, Cu(I) catalyzed nucleophilic epoxide openings and 1,4-additions
              to unsaturated substrates.

With this renewal, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Tom Livinghouse of the
              Department of Chemistry at Montana State University.  Professor Livinghouse
              will focus his work on developing  new methods for metal mediated ring
              formation and asymmetric ligand design.  Motivation for the research is
              provided by the growing need for many substances in a stereoisomerically pure
              state.  The research will have broader impacts for the pharmaceutical and
              agricultural industries and for the training of graduate students.
