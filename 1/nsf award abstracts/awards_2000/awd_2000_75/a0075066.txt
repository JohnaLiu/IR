POWRE:  Integrating
              Information Resources for the Canopy Scientist a Model System for the Ecology
              and Database Research Community

This work extends an ongoing project that
              focuses on building database facilities for forest canopy scientists into
              research, leading towards a model for ecologists and computer scientists.  The
              grant will be used to extend a six-month sabbatical into fifteen months of
              intensive research and development experience. Meanwhile, integrating relevant
              computer science research, efforts will be made to build an effective
              community-wise database for an emerging ecological field.  The PI will also
              explore the use of access- and workflow-oriented mediators, integrating
              metadata with data, data validation, data transformation, schema representation
              and integration using XML.  The focus will be on metadata acquisition and
              spatial transformations for data integration.
