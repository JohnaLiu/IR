Abstract    :
              This proposal funds the PI to spend the 2000/2001 academic year in the Biology
              department at the University of Oregon with Professor Michael Lynch serving as
              host. The PI will collaborate with the
Ecology and Evolution group on projects
              including sampling strategies for phylogenetic comparative techniques and the
              understanding of duplicate gene preservation through subfunctionalization. The
              first of these is of very practical importance to Biologists as it will help in
              designing experiments. The second has theoretical importance in the
              understanding of genome evolution. The PI will also design and teach a course
              on
mathematical modeling for Biology. Expected outcomes of this grant include
              increasing the interaction between the Biology and Mathematics departments at
              UO, improving the mathematical training of Biology students, broadening the
              background of Mathematics students, and shaping the future direction of the
              PI's research.  This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of 
              Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences
              (DMS).
