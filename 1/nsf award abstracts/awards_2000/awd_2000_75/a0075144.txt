ABSTRACT

This award is for the partial support of a conference
              in the field of Several Complex Variables. The conference will address problems
              in the theory of biholomorphic mappings and its connections with PDE, geometry
              and function theory. The list of participants includes all the major
              contributors in the field and the conference will definitely attract many young
              investigators. Having conference to be held in Palo Alto, California also
              provides an opportunity for the participants to interact with researchers from
              UC Berkeley, Stanford and MSRI. I strongly recommend the award.
