Carbon turnover through the soil microbial
              community

Terrestrial ecosystems are driven by inputs of organic carbon
              derived from their plant communities.  The quantity and quality of this carbon
              changes during the different growth stages of the plants and is influenced by
              seasonal climate.  The investigators hypothesize that these factors exert
              selective pressures on the soil microbial community and influences which
              microbes respond to plant carbon inputs, where such responses take place, and
              the fate of plant carbon in the soil. The fate of plant-derived organic carbon
              will be followed by labeling tall fescue grass with a stable carbon isotope and
              following the labeled plant carbon in shoot and root residues as they
              decompose.  At the same time, microbial activities, community composition and
              turnover will be measured with a combination of molecular and biochemical
              techniques.  The project will provide new information about how climate and
              plant carbon inputs interact with the microbial community to influence how
              carbon is processed in soil.
