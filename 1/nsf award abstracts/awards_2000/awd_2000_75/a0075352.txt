This project will investigate the ability of mobile herbivores
              (grazers) to regulate the structure and function of the autotrophic community
              (e.g., algae), and how this relationship varies with changing environmental
              conditions.  The research approach is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying
              the outcomes of interactions among herbivore species under a range of physical
              conditions.  Herbivores that graze bottom communities in streams will be
              included in a series of experiments whereby the dominant environmental gradient
              (current velocity) is altered.  Experiments will assess autotrophic biomass
              accumulation and community composition across the environmental gradient, as
              well as the functional redundancy among grazer species in regulating algal
              communities.  The experimental approaches are well integrated so that it will
              be possible to scale-up experiments and make mechanistic predictions about the
              magnitude of multi-species herbivory under variable environmental conditions. 
              Results of this study may extend to other ecosystems with spatial heterogeneity
              in physical conditions and with a variety of herbivorous species.  Moreover,
              the research has significant implications for understanding co-existence of
              consumers and the degree of "redundancy" or "substitutability" among species. 
              Such understanding is critical for supporting successful restoration of stream
              and river ecosystems.
