	Peatmosses (plants of the bryophyte genus Sphagnum) are a
              dominant component of many Northern and Southern Hemisphere ecosystems.
              Sphagnum-dominated habitats are ecologically important in terms of regional
              hydrology, and peat accumulation is of profound significance to global carbon
              budgets and therefore global climates. Sphagnum-dominated peatlands are most
              prominent in boreal regions where huge deposits of partially decomposed peat
              accumulate, and most people associate Sphagnum with such northern hemisphere
              habitats. Nonetheless, species of Sphagnum are also diverse in the tropics, and
              one evolutionary hypothesis suggests that South America is the center of
              peatmoss diversity. Dr. Jonathan Shaw of Duke University and colleagues are
              studying the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of the 200-450 species of
              Sphagnum in order to investigate these and other ideas about the patterns of
              species diversity worldwide in the genus. The project makes extensive use of
              DNA sequencing, of both nuclear and chloroplast genes, as sources of evidence
              of phylogenetic (genealogical) relatedness and to estimate levels of genetic
              and genomic diversity within sublineages of Sphagnum. Molecular and
              morphological lines of evidence will be combined in studies of presumptive
              cases of hybridization and of cryptic species, where similar morphologies are
              thought to obscure significant genetic divergence. The project will lead to an
              improved infrageneric classification for the hundreds of species worldwide of
              Sphagnum, and contribute to understanding the mechanisms of peatmoss
              diversification over geological time.
