Metapopulation theory posits that suitable habitat may
              frequently be unoccupied. Furthermore, source-sink theory predicts that species
              may often occupy unsuitable habitat, given that immigration from source areas
              is sufficiently high. This project addresses the crucial question of how to
              identify suitable, unoccupied habitat and distinguish it from unsuitable
              habitat. The proposed research focuses on six species of forest understory
              herbs. The species were chosen to represent a broad range of habitat
              distribution and dispersal characteristics appropriate for testing the specific
              hypotheses to be addressed. This study is being conducted at the Coweeta LTER
              site. The approach includes experimental field tests of specific hypotheses
              about the role of soil moisture and temperature in determining the geographic
              and altitudinal ranges of the study species. Overall, the study will both
              further conceptual understanding of the relationships between habitat
              requirements and species distributions and will provide a practical approach to
              operationalizing the concept of suitable habitat. The study should also prove
              useful in predicting and monitoring changes in species distributions in
              response to climate change.
