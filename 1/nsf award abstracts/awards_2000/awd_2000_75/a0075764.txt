Abstract    :
              Typically, rural to urban migration in the developing world is often accompanied
              by a shift to nuclear families and reduced fertility. But in sub-Saharan
              Africa, fertility does not always decline with urbanization and this appears to
              be associated with the highly active, social and economic ties migrants
              maintain with home villages. Using anthropological demography, this project
              will investigate how reproductive rates (fertility) are influenced by the
              kinship networks that link urban migrants and their rural villages in Nigeria.
              The research focuses on six Igbo-speaking villages and their migrants to Kano,
              the largest city in northern Nigeria. The PI will adopt a life cycle approach
              to examine how each of the four major life stages (adolescence, marriage,
              child-bearing, and cessation of child-bearing) entail different cultural,
              behavioral and reproductive health issues, as well different patterns of
              migratory behavior. Methods include a random survey of 400 rural households and
              a survey of all linked migrant households in Kano, as well as collection of
              life histories and participant observation. Surveys will elicit fertility and
              migration histories and explore social and economic interactions between
              households. This research will contribute to our understanding of rural to
              urban migration shapes fertility patterns in the developing world.
