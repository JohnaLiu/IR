     The investigator and her colleagues combine
              modern
techniques of computation and theoretical modeling to
              complement
current experimental research in insect flight. 
              These
computations reveal the three-dimensional flows around an elastic
wing
              that mimics the flapping motion of insects.  The
computational results also
              establish a basis for developing
mathematical models of vortex shedding in
              unsteady flows
(traditionally described by the unsteady Kutta condition). 
              A
solution of this longstanding problem in fluid mechanics would
help to lay
              the foundation for a general theory of flapping
flight.
     Insect flight is
              fascinating in its own right, but more
generally, it can provide insight into
              other fluid mechanical
problems that involve interactions between dynamic
              boundaries and
highly unsteady viscous flows.  The investigator explores
              how
Nature solves the problem of insect flight.  The lessons learned
from
              insect flight are applicable to other physical and
engineering systems where
              there is a tight coupling between a
vortex wake and the oscillating body that
              generated it.  Examples
range from the famous devastating Tacoma Narrows
              bridge accident
to our everyday experience of the dynamics of a piece of
              falling
paper and the rising of bubbles in fluids.  Finally,
              understanding
the aerodynamics of insect flight can provide a new paradigm
              in
designing micro-air vehicles.
