Abstract    :
              This project will examine the Hox genes, which specify the fundamental
              organization of body plans, to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of
              lophotrochozoans.  As one of the three major lineages of bilateral animals,
              this group contains the greatest diversity of body plan organization and are
              purported to encompas at least 10 recognized phyla (including annelids,
              mollusks, ectoprocts, brachipods, and platyhelminthes).  Before the factors
              that shaped metazoan macroevolution and diversification are understood, the
              evolutionary relationships of the lophotrochozoans are critically needed.  In
              addition to constructing gene geneologies, this work will employ information on
              organization and gene composition of the Hox cluster.  To this end, four
              bacterial artifical chromosome libraries will be produced, thus allowing the
              entire Hox cluster to be sequenced.  To augment this library, evolutionary
              history will be reconstructed from 28S rDNA and COI genes for 49
              lophotrochozoan taxa.  This study will provide data that can be used to address
              several long-standing issues, including understanding the evolutionary and
              developmental plasticity of segmentation and embryogenesis.
