Plant-microbe interactions and the production
              of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen

Nitrogen (N) saturation of
              terrestrial ecosystems is one of the most important contemporary ecological
              issues.  Researchers at Michigan Technological University and the University of
              Michigan are adding nitrate (NO3-) to northern hardwood forests in Michigan to
              learn how this common forest type responds to chronic N additions.  After six
              years, a variety of changes indicate chronic N additions have altered ecosystem
              processes.  These include much greater leaching losses of dissolved organic
              carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen and nitrate, and reduced soil respiration.
              Over the next three years the research team will continue the nitrate additions
              in order to learn the specific mechanisms behind these changes and to determine
              if they will persist over time or if they are only temporary responses that
              will fade as the ecosystems adjust to higher levels of N availability.  If the
              changes persist or magnify, they could have profound effects on this
              widely-distributed forest type.
