Stress distribution and fracture propagation in osteons under
              cyclic torsional loading are the topics of this research which is supported by
              a POWRE award.  Novel experimental data will be obtained in collaboration with
              the A. Ascenzi research group at "La Sapienza" University in Rome.  Samples of
              fully calcified representative osteon types (longitudinal and alternate
              osteons) will be isolated and torsionally loaded.  Experimentally obtained
              torque vs angle-of-twist diagrams will be statistically analyzed in terms of
              stiffness degradation, pinching degradation, and energy absorption.  The
              structural differences between the longitudinal and alternate osteons should
              correspond to differences in such parameters.  Subsequent interpretation in
              terms of ultrastructural components and observation of fractured samples will
              form the base for a fracture model.  This first fracture micromechanical model
              allows prediction of the progressive growth of the faulting zones by assessing
              the increased probability of failure in the vicinity of already cracked
              regions.
This research builds on the PI's recent work on bone microstructural
              osteons and lamellae.  The study will serve as a foundation for the deduction
              of more realistic non-homogeneous macrostructural mechanical properties of
              compact bone through lamellar distribution, homogenization methods and finite
              element analysis.  Although sample dimensions render bone microstructural
              experiments difficult, such microstructural studies allow the discovery of
              properties, absent in the macrostructure, but nevertheless with fundamental
              implications for it.  Accordingly, this research impacts the study of bone
              reconstruction and prostheses and pertains to the study of other natural
              composites as well as the manufacture of new composites.
The POWRE award will
              allow the PI to re-start her academic career after an interruption for family
              reasons and to redirect her research speciality from mathematics to
              biomechanics.
