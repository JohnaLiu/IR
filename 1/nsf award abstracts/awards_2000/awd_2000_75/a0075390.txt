Abstract    :
              Shaul Mukamel of the University of Rochester and Rudy Marcus of Caltech are
              supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program for a
              prototype summer school for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows,
              administered through the Gordon Research Conferences office.  The summer school
              runs 11 days and consists of 3-4 lectures per day morning and evening, with
              afternoons open for discussion.  Lecturers are in residence for at least 7 of
              the 11 days, to allow time for interaction with students.  The focus of this
              summer school, a pilot program, is on teaching analytic techniques relevant to
              rate processes in the condensed phase.  It is envisioned that future summer
              schools will focus on other areas of theoretical chemistry.

The purpose of
              this summer school is to provide a basic survey of current theoretical
              techniques to chemistry graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and advanced
              senior undergraduate students.  The lectures will emphasize and illustrate
              specific analytical techniques as well as physically motivated approximations
              and the connection with current experiments.  Lecturers will discuss what
              aspects of their work are transferable to other quite different problems in
              various fields of theory.
