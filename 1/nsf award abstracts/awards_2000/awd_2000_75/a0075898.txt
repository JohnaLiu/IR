This project in anthropological linguistics will investigate
              the implementation of a "Catholic Quechua" language as the principal medium of
              missionization in Spanish colonial Peru. It will examine the mechanisms through
              which the colonial regime defined and consolidated a standard missionary
              vernacular within the existing native languages, and how it reproduced Catholic
              genre frames (modes of religious discourse) in the Quechua language and among
              native Andeans. Linguistic and textual analysis will be integrated with the
              archival study of the history of missionary activity in Indian parishes. This
              project will contribute to our understanding of how missionization programs
              (like more recent efforts at language change linked to nationalism,
              globalization, and education) work to link local cultures into a global
              political sphere.
