Abstract    :
              This pilot project will begin a study of the climate and hydrology near the
              isolated Lake El'gygytgyn in Siberia.  This unique lake was formed by a meteor
              impact about 3.6 million years ago. Other funded projects are evaluating the
              climate history of eastern Siberia by examination of the undisturbed sediments
              in the Lake.  The proposed project would place a full meteorological tower at
              one of the stream inlets to the Lake in order to measure precipitation, air
              temperature, soil moisture, solar radiation, relative humidity, snow depth, and
              soil temperature.  This data will begin baseline measurements of the local
              climate.  Data would be collected during 6 weeks in summer 2000 and instruments
              left for automated collection over the next 2 years.  The data would be used to
              begin an evaluation the hydrological cycle in eastern Siberia, a region where
              our current understanding of regional climatological is weak.  This work could
              form the basis for more extensive future research on the vegetation and water
              cycles of Siberia following the research format presently occurring in the
              Alaskan tundra.
