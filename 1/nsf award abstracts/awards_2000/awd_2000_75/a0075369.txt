Outcrops of serpentine soil in
              California support a rich flora of endemic
species, many of which are
              naturally rare. This study will test the
hypothesis that species diversity in
              this specialized flora is shaped by the
island-like nature of serpentine
              outcrops, among other factors.  I will
analyze patterns of species diversity
              in the serpentine endemic flora across
the entire state, considering diversity
              at both the regional scale
(subcounties) and the local scale (50 x 20 m
              plots).  The regional data will
be gathered from published sources and
              analyzed with spatial statistics; the
local data will be gathered by intensive
              field sampling at 24 sites
distributed around the state.  Path analysis and
              other statistical
techniques will be used to determine the relationships
              between regional
species diversity, local species diversity, and environmental
              variables
(e.g. soil chemistry, climate, topography, and the spatial
              distribution of
serpentine)."
