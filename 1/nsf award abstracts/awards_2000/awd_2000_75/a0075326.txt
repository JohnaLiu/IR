Abstract    :
              This proposal will add some 172 outrigger counters to Milagro.  This new
              addition will improve Milagro's energy resolution, remove a systematic angular
              bias, and increase the detector aperture.  Funding this proposal will also
              enable Milagro to identify those gamma bursts with high-energy gamma rays in a
              timely way so that this information can be broadcasted to other detectors and
              telescopes for confirming observations.
