Abstract    :
              This grant provides funding for a interdisciplinary collaboration bringing
              together design and manufacturing experts with computer science experts to
              define a scalable information infrastructure to support product design in a
              multi-organization environment with limited but crucial trust and sharing in a
              cooperative context.  To this end, this project will study the decomposition of
              a large design into smaller pieces that are worked on relatively independently;
              it will use and extend the XML internet standard to create a mechanism for
              "self-description" of an object-oriented design database structure so that each
              design group can independently choose to organize information in the most
              suitable form for its purpose, along with a schema description and access
              control meta-data in a standardized format; and it will develop tools to manage
              collaborative design in a diffuse distributed context, with shifting coalitions
              and topics of interest, using a generalized publish/subscribe model.

The end
              result of this project will be to create the basis upon which to build a
              comprehensive inter-enterprise design information management system.  The
              results obtained from this research will reduce time-to-market and increase
              efficiencies in the design of complex products such as automobiles.  It also
              has the potential to revolutionize enterprise resource management.
