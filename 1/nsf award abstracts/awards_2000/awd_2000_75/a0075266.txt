Abstract    :
              Professor Nancy Levinger of Colorado State University is funded by the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry program to perform experimental studies on
              solvation dynamics in micelles.  Solvent molecules inside reverse micelle
              systems are perturbed by interfacial interactions with the walls of the
              micelle, and this is a model system for the more complicated environments such
              as those found in cells and in geological structures.  In this proposal the PI
              seeks to continue her previous work on these systems using a variety of
              advanced ultrafast time-resolved methods such as Stokes shift and photon
              echoes.  Representative micellar systems include ones with varying head groups.
               Ultrafast electron transfer processes are also to be probed.  The overall goal
              is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the way in which restricted
              environments inside reverse micelles influence dynamical behavior of the
              solvent and to understand how this influences chemical reactions.  

The
              results will aid scientists studying reactions and processes in biological and
              geochemical microenvironments such as soils, rocks and biological cells and
              organelles where the effect of the solvent is poorly understood.
