Funding is provided to continue partial support for the
              ICES/GLOBEC North Atlantic Regional Program Office within the International
              Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). ICES is an intergovernmental
              organization designed to coordinate scientific research, fisheries assessment,
              environmental concerns, and oceanographic matters of common interest to
              countries bordering the North Atlantic.  The ICES/GLOBEC program is the North
              Atlantic regional component of the International GLOBEC Implementation Plan.
              GLOBEC (Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics) is an international research program
              intended to improve forecasts of the responses of the marine ecosystem to
              physical forcing and global change by developing our understanding of its
              structure and functioning under varying physical conditions. The project office
              is responsible for coordinating efforts to keep interested research communities
              informed about ongoing work, design means for data exchange, plan cooperative
              research, organize workshops for the collective appraisal and analysis of
              information, and publish results in a timely and adequate way.
