Workshop on Logic Control for
              Manufacturing Systems

Discrete part manufacturing systems typically consist
              of numerous machines
working together in a coordinated and sequential fashion.
               Programmable
logic controllers are widely used to implement the control
              algorithms for
these machines.  Systems with hundreds or thousands of inputs
              and outputs,
many of them simple on/off switches, are not uncommon.  The
              logic
controller must handle not only the normal operation sequence
              and
synchronization of the machines, but also the operator interface and
              error
handling and recovery routines.

The purpose of this workshop is to
              bring together participants from
industry and academia to create an
              understanding of the gaps which exist
between the theory of discrete-event
              systems and control and their
implementation in industrial manufacturing
              systems.  The focus will be on
coordination and sequencing problems,
              complexity management, error handling
and recovery, automatic generation of
              executable code, and control
verification.
