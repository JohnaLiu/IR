Some of the most conspicuous features of organisms are
              differences between the sexes (known as sexual dimorphism).  Sexual selection
              is usually invoked to explain such differences and may explain dimorphism in
              characters that are not directly related to mate acquisition because of a
              cascade of genetic effects.  Previous research with the dioecious  plant Silene
              latifolia, which has remarkable sexual dimorphism in flower production, shows
              that individuals that produce a relatively high number of flowers have
              upregulated metabolisms and may pay life history costs (such as lower
              longevity).  Artificial selection lines will be created that will have both
              increased and reduced sexual dimorphism in flower size and number.  These lines
              will be planted out in experimental arrays to assess the consequences of flower
              production on fitness via two pathways - mating success (sexual selection) and
              longevity (natural selection).

The combination of increasing the phenotypic
              variation in traits via artificial selection and subsequent field
              experimentation with these lines should yield great power in understanding the
              causes and patterns of selection.  This work will help us determine whether
              sexual dimorphism in morphological, physiological, and life history traits has
              evolved via sexual selection.
