Abstract    :
              Most pathogenic fungi have two stages in their lifecycle.  One stage is produced
              by fertilization and has chromosomes from both parents, whereas the other stage
              is produced by mechanisms similar to gamete formation, and therefore has only
              half the number of  chromosomes (the haploid stage).  Often, the two stages
              differ in the degree to which they cause disease.  This study uses molecular
              biology and other experimental studies to explore the link between disease
              ecology and genetic structure of a plant pathogenic fungus where the haploid
              stage is avoided by a special kind of mating (intra-tetrad selfing).  This
              study will use the anther-smut fungus, Microbotryum violaceum, as a
              well-studied model system.

Intra-tetrad selfing also occurs in a wide range
              of organism, including commercially and scientifically valuable fungi, plants,
              and insects (e.g. yeasts and fruit flies), but its consequences have never been
              explored empirically.  The proposed research will therefore have relevance for
              understanding genetic variation in species with this breeding system and
              possible novel mechanisms for changes in pathogenic virulence.
