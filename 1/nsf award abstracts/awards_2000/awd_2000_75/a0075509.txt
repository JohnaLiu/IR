Collaborative Research: Recovery of Ecosystem Structure and
              Function
Following Exotic Species Eradication

The proposed research
              examines how ecosystems respond, not to invasion, but to the elimination of an
              exotic species.  Specifically, this proposal examines the recovery of alpine
              lake systems in the Sierra Nevada, California, after the eradication of exotic
              trout.  
The PI's will ask whether vertebrate and invertebrate species native
              to alpine lakes return after the removal of exotic fish. A long-term whole-lake
              experiment will be used in which exotic fish have been successfully removed
              from three experimental lakes, while fish stocking continues in three control
              lakes. Monitoring of faunal assemblages in these six lakes, monitoring begun in
              1996 before fish eradication, will continue in order to determine the rate of
              recovery and to better understand the life history attributes of species that
              facilitate or hinder recovery.  The PI's will also ask how changes in species
              assemblages influence the functioning of alpine lake ecosystems. They will
              continue limnological monitoring of the whole-lake experiment to evaluate
              changes in nutrients and algal biomass following fish removal.  The results of
              this study have important implications for the restoration of aquatic
              ecosystems worldwide.
