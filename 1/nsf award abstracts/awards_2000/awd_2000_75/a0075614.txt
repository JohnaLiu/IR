Abstract    :
              Freshwater crabs pose a number of interesting evolutionary and biogeographic
              questions.  They represent one of the most speciose groups of crabs, but our
              understanding of their systematics and phylogenetic relationships is severely
              limited.  Although speciose, they are similar in their morphology, their
              dependence on freshwater, and their unusual life history.  Based on a few
              characteristics, freshwater crabs have long been assumed to be monophyletic. 
              This view has been challenged, however, in light of their intriguing
              biogeographical distribution.  This study will undertake the most comprehensive
              phylogenetic study of freshwater crabs to date by using both morphological and
              molecular data for all freshwater lineages and their putative marine relatives.
               Specifically, we propose to use morphological and molecular mitochondrial and
              nuclear DNA data to establish independently phylogenies for both freshwater and
              eubrachyuran marine crabs, to use these results to test monophyly of the
              groups, to estimate the time of origin of freshwater crabs, and to evaluate and
              revise the existing higher order classification of freshwater crabs.
