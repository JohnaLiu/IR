The infrared camera, that has been requested by the two PI's,
              will immediately support five active investigations and it will provide the
              stimulus and basis for future studies.  The immediate studies are in two
              categories:  convective flows of liquid metals and the behavior of catalysis
              units.  These investigations are well motivated in terms of their scientific
              attributes as well as their contributions to the associated technological
              applications.
