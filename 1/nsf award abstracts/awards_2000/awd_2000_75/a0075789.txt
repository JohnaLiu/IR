Anisotropic Thermal Conduction in
              Deforming Polymers

Flow-induced orientation of polymeric molecules results
              in anisotropic 
mechanical, optical and thermal properties and has profound
              effects on 
material properties.  The objective of this study is to obtain
              
quantitative, time-dependent measurements of the thermal diffusivity tensor
              
in deforming polymer liquids.  These measurements will be made using a
              
non-invasive optical technique known as Forced Rayleigh Scattering. 

              Experiments will be conducted on several polymer melts in step-shear 
strain
              and cessation of steady shear rate flows.  Measured components of 
the thermal
              diffusivity tensor will used in conjunction with mechanical 
(stress) and
              optical (birefringence) data to evaluate the stress-thermal
              
rule.
		
Understanding the connection between the flow-induced orientation
              that 
occurs during processing of polymers and their end-use physical
              properties 
is essential.  The thermal diffusivity tensor measurements
              obtained in this 
study will significantly enhance efforts to formulate
              physically-meaningful 
process flow models that can be used for the
              development of advanced 
processing technologies and applications.
