Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at William Marsh Rice University
              will acquire a console for a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will
              enable researchers to carry out studies on a) metallocene-alumoxane
              interactions; b) solution structural characterization of tri-metallic
              molecules; c) characterization of the product distribution and relative yield
              from the facile hydrogen/deuterium exchange in organic and organometallic
              aromatic compounds catalyzed by Group 13-mercury complexes; d) synthesis of
              molecules of precise length and constitution for electronic, photonic, and
              template self-replication applications; e) development of novel organic
              synthetic methods and the total synthesis of natural products; f) metal atom
              chemistry; g) chemistry of novel aromatic systems; h) terpene biosynthesis
              using recombinant microorganisms; and g) the synthesis of single-stranded DNA
              oligomers containing nonnatural nucleotides.   

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. 
              Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry and biochemistry.
