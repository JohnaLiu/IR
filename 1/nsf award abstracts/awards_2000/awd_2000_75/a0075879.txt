This grant is for partial support for a FASEB Summer Research
              Conference on Phospholipases.  The conference aims to review the current status
              of what is known about the structure, function and regulation of phospholipases
              A2, C and D.  These ubiquitous enzymes trigger major signal transduction
              pathways by producing lipid products that mediate diverse cellular responses. 
              Phospholipase A2 enzymes release arachidonic acid, which is the first step in
              the production of the eicosanoids and platelet activation factor, which are
              inflammatory mediators.  Phospholipase C enzymes mediate the production of
              polyphosphoinositols and diacylglycerols, which regulate calcium levels and
              protein kinase C.  Phospholipase D enzymes produce phosphatidic acid  from
              phosphatidylcholine and are implicated in regulating vesicle trafficking,
              mitogenesis, respiratory burst oxidase and other enzymes.  This conference will
              bring together enzymologists and molecular cell biologists to provide an
              opportunity for in depth scientific discussions.  It will also promote
              interactions between young investigators and senior scientists.
