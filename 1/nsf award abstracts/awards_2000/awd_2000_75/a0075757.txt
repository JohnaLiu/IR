The Committee of Astronomy and Astrophysics (CAA) is
              the National Research Council's advisory body for astronomy and astrophysics,
              both ground and space-based.  The objectives of the CAA are to monitor the
              status of astronomy and astrophysics, to provide broadly based independent
              strategic advice to federal agencies, to serve as a multi-agency forum for
              discussion and coordination, and to monitor implementation of the
              recommendations in the report of the decadal Astronomy and Astrophysics Survey
              Committee.   The CAA meets these objectives by conducting meetings and by
              producing reports and studies as needed and as requested by federal agencies
              and by Congress.   The activity is supported jointly by the NSF and NASA.  This
              award is funded by the Division of Astronomical Sciences.
