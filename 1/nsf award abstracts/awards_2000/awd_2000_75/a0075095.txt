The P.I. proposes a project to establish a phylogeny for
              Vernonieae, develop new collaborations with researchers working on the
              subfamily Cichorioideae and evolution within the Asteraceae (Smithsonian's
              Laboratory of Molecular Systematics).  She will acquire sequencing expertise
              for chloroplast and nuclear genomes.  There are four main objectives of this
              work: 1) obtain training in techniques and approaches for sequencing genes and
              gene regions in the chloroplast and nucleus that lead to phylogenetically
              informative data; 2) construct the first subtribal phylogeny for the Vernonieae
              with representative from all known geographical areas and from all known
              lineages; 3) participate in ongoing studies of the Cichorioideae; and 4)
              identify specific clades within the Vernonieae for future study.  This POWRE 
              award will provide the PI with a chance to reinvigorate her research program
              after having spent the last 6 years in adminstration.
