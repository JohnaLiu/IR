              PROJECT SUMMARY

The purpose of this award is to provide travel support to
              allow Douglas Cenzer (University of Florida), Valentina Harizanov (George
              Washington University), Julia Knight (University of Notre Dame), Steffen Lempp
              and Reed Solomon (University of Wisconsin-Madison), and Andre Nies (University
              of Chicago) as well as Marat Arslanov (Kazan State University), Sergey
              Goncharov and Andrei Morozov (Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk), and
              Serikzhan Badaev and Mikhail Peretyat'kin (Kazakh Academy of Sciences, Almaty)
              to make one research visit each to work collaboratively with their counterparts
              in the other country, as well as a total of three additional trips by
              students.

The focus of the proposed cooperative research is the theory of
              computability and its applications to other areas, in particular algebra and
              model theory. Specific research topics include the study of computable
              approximations to sets, the complexity of presentations of algebraic
              structures, the complexity of additional relations on effective structures, the
              complexity of isomorphisms of effective structures, numerations of algebraic
              structures, automorphism groups of computable structures, and applications to
              abelian $p$-groups, to groups of computable permutations, and to Boolean
              algebras
