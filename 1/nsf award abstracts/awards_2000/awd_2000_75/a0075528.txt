Abstract    :
              The American Physical Society (APS), in partnership with the American
              Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT) and the American Institute of Physics
              (AIP) plans to establish a program that will dramatically improve the
              preparation of physics and physical science teachers, nation-wide. This project
              will increase the role of physics departments, in collaboration with education
              departments, to create more and better-prepared future teachers. The PhysTEC
              staff will negotiate signed subcontracts and a detailed Scope of Work from each
              of the preliminary Primary Program Institutions (PPIs) sites. The selection of
              PPIs will be based on the individual institution's commitment to become
              actively involved with teacher preparation reform as demonstrated by their
              degree of effectiveness (success) with previous efforts.  The preliminary PPIs
              initially chosen will include a mix of very large and smaller institutions, as
              well as, one Historically Black College (HBCU).  A small conference will also
              be scheduled in the fall 2000 in Washington, D.C.  If the grant is awarded,
              planning and hiring of the Teacher-in-Residence will commence at each site
              during the spring and summer months of 2001. The full program of course
              revision and departmental changes would begin in the fall 2001. This project is
              co-funded by the NSF Division of Undergraduate Education, Division of
              Elementary, Secondary, and Informal Education, Division of Materials Research,
              and the Division of Physics.
