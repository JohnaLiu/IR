Collaborative Research - The Role of Fatty Acids
              and Limiting Elements in Biogeochemical Cycling and Food Web Dynamics

The
              food quality of plants for herbivores may have profound impacts on a wide
              variety of processes.  These include eutrophication (or nuisance algal blooms),
              the strength of interactions between different levels in the food web (i.e.
              plants and herbivores), biomass accumulation at each trophic level, and
              fisheries production.  The objective of this research is to determine the role
              essential fatty acids and elements such as phosphorus and nitrogen play in
              regulating these processes.  Experimental and modeling results suggest that
              when algal essential fatty acid content is high, zooplankton grow rapidly and
              build up a biomass sufficient to suppress plants.  This results in relatively
              high water quality (high water clarity due to low algal biomass) and high
              fisheries production. Alternatively, algae with low essential fatty acid
              content will result in poor water clarity and zooplankton growth, and reduced
              fisheries production.  The investigators plan to use fatty acid analyses to
              examine energy flow through aquatic food webs: from plants to herbivores to
              carnivores to economically important fish.
