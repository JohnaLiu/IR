Colder soils in a warmer world: A snow
              manipulation in a northern hardwood forest ecosystem

Analysis of the
              indirect effects of climate change on ecosystem processes is a critical
              challenge in ecosystem ecology.  Snow depth is an important regulator of
              nitrogen (N) cycling in ecosystems and is highly responsive to changes in
              climate.  This project is investigating changes in nitrogen (N) cycling and
              loss that occur in response to experimental manipulations of snowpack in a
              northern hardwood forest.  The investigators will experimentally simulate the
              late development of snowpack, which is predicted to occur under warmer climate
              conditions, and characterize effects on soil freezing, soil physical structure
              and N cycling and loss. The project will produce basic information on physical
              control of plant-soil-microbial interactions and will allow scientists to
              evaluate the effects of reductions in snow cover associated with climate change
              on soil fertility, air and water quality, and the N cycling and retention of
              these forest ecosystems.
