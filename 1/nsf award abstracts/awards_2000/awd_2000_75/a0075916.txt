Abstract    :
              This Cooperative Agreement between the National Science Foundation and the
              University of California, Los Angeles, provides funding for the operation of a
              national facility for research in basic plasma science at the University of
              California, Los Angeles.  The core of the facility is the Large Plasma Device
              (LAPD-II), a unique research instrument well suited for collaborative studies
              by multiple users.  The facility provides a place in which to perform
              frontier-level experiments that require physical conditions not suitable for
              small devices.   The LAPD will be operated on a 24-hour basis, except for
              necessary pauses for routine maintenance and upgrades,  providing
              research-grade plasmas at a one Hertz repetition rate and having a wide range
              of possible parameter choices under the user's control.  This project is
              jointly funded by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy
              as part of the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Plasma Science and Engineering. 
              NSF funding is divided between the Physics Division in the Mathematical and
              Physical Sciences Directorate and the Division of Atmospheric Sciences in the
              Directorate for Geosciences.
