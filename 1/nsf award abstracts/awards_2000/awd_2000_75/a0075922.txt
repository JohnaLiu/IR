Abstract    :
              The goal of this Engineering Foundation Conference is to provide an
              international, cross-disciplinary forum for discussion and presentation of the
              latest results in the area of heat transfer and transport phenomena occurring
              at very small time or length scales. This conference will provide an
              opportunity to share the knowledge in the areas of microscale thermophysics and
              transport which are key to a variety of rapidly emerging areas such as
              nanotechnology, biotechnology and microelectromechanical system (MEMS)
              development. The conference will provide the forum for an exchange of ideas,
              results, and industrial needs in the area of thermal phenomena associated with
              microstructures and microsystems.  This 5 day conference will be held in Banff,
              Canada in mid October 2000. Papers presented in this conference will be
              accepted based on abstract reviews. A call for papers for the conference has
              been disseminated throughout the world, soliciting abstracts of papers to be
              considered for presentation at the conference. All accepted papers will be
              included in the conference proceedings, which will be published for wide
              dissemination.
