Abstract    :
              This award will provide partial support to assist younger scientists (graduate
              students, postdoctoral fellows, or beginning faculty) to attend the 2000 Gordon
              Research Conference on Polymer Physics.  The Conference has two major themes
              this year: The first is dynamics in polymers (rheology, phase transition
              kinetics, blends, block copolymers, membranes), and the second is biopolymer
              physics (membranes, folding, recognition, and self-assembly).
