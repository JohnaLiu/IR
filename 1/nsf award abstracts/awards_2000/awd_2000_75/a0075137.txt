Abstract    :
              The 2000 Winter Conference of Gravitational Waves and their Detection will take
              place at the Aspen Institute of Physics from February 20 through February 26,
              2000.  About 75 scientists and engineers are expected to attend.  This is the
              fourth in a series of interactive conferences designed to explore new
              experimental techniques for the detection of gravitational radiation.  The
              grant will provide  funds from the NSF to pay for part of travel expenses for
              about five participants selected on the basis of their need for funds and the
              importance of their participation to the conduct of the conference.  Preference
              will be given to students and research associates.
