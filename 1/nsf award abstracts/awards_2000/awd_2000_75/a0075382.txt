Proteins associated with male reproductive function
              typically evolve much faster than other proteins.  In marine invertebrates that
              release their eggs and sperm directly into seawater, these male proteins, along
              with their egg-borne female complements, determine whether individuals and
              species can interbreed.  Natural selection is known to promote the divergence
              of these male proteins between species; however, the mechanisms causing this
              selection--particularly the role of functionally related female
              proteins--remain unknown.  

Dr. Hellberg will evaluate proposed mechanisms
              for selection on the sperm protein lysin by comparing DNA sequences of the
              genes encoding lysin and its egg-borne receptor (VERL) from different species
              of the marine snail Tegula.  VERL contains about 30 internal repeats of 150
              amino acids, but sequences for flanking regions at the beginning and end of
              this protein are not known.  Using molecular methods, the PI will determine DNA
              sequence information for VERL.  He will then compare patterns of this sequence
              data among different species of Tegula. 

Patterns of VERL variation should
              illuminate mechanisms causing rapid change in gamete recognition proteins, in
              turn broadening our understanding of adaptive molecular change in general and
              the evolution of new, reproductively isolated species in particular.  In
              addition, co-evolution between VERL and lysin may provide insights into the
              design of highly specific molecular glues (which like VERL are often composed
              of repeated molecular sequences).
