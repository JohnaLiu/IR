Abstract    :
              This grant supports an interdisciplinary research project in applied mathematics
              and neurobiology.  Specifically, the PI will spend an academic year leave
              visiting the Department of Neurobiology and Physiology at Northwestern
              University.  The goal of this interdisciplinary research program is: 1) to
              participate
in and assist with the modeling of ongoing experiments on
              hippocampal neurons; 2) to use the focused learning environment to develop a
              sufficient understanding of neurobiology and the skills necessary for continued
              research in this area; 3) to create materials that can be used as part of the
              graduate and
undergraduate curricula in the PI's home department.  Specific
              problems to be examined include the modeling of slow, cumulative sodium channel
              inactivation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, and a study of the causes of
              bursting in subicular hippocampal neurons. To help ensure the project's
              success, the PI will be
externally advised throughout the duration of the work
              by other researchers familiar with the application of mathematics to biology. 
              This IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary
              Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
