The University of Texas (UT) will operate the R/V Longhorn
              during 2000 as a general oceanographic research vessel in support of
              NSF-supported research projects.  The Longhorn is a 103 ft. vessel, constructed
              in 1971 and rebuilt/stretched in 1986, and is owned and operated by UT.  The
              vessel is scheduled for a total of 78 operational days during 2000, of which 19
              days are in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining cruises will
              support University, State, Navy, and private projects.  The projects scheduled
              on the Longhorn include several oceanographic disciplines and will fully
              utilize the capabilities of the vessel.  Operations will take place regionally
              in the Gulf of Mexico.

The Longhorn is part of a fleet of ships used by the
              National Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most
              oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to be permanently
              installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These
              vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a
              result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated
              to oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions
              around the country.
