This program includes experimental and theoretical
research
              in a variety of areas in nuclear physics. The projects are
focussed on
              fundamental understanding of the structure and 
interactions of nucleons and
              the use of nuclear physics to
perform precision tests the standard electroweak
              theory.
A substantial part of the experimental program involves
studies of
              parity violation in electron scattering from
nucleons, nuclei, and electrons.
              A program to exploit
a new intense source of ultra-cold neutrons in Los
              Alamos
will study the beta asymmetry in neutron decay with
unprecedented
              precision as well as other fundamental properties
of neutrons. The education
              and training of students
and postdoctoral scholars is a key aspect of this
              research program.
