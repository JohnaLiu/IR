Abstract    :
              

The principal investigator will convene a workshop of approximately 40
              participants to assess current scientific needs in ocean carbon cycle research
              and to discuss the possibilities of proposing a new research initiative aimed
              at addressing those needs. The workshop on Ocean Carbon Transport, Exchanges,
              and Transformations (OCTET) would be designed to fit within the framework of
              the Carbon Cycle Science Plan (CCSP) prepared for consideration for
              consideration by the federal agencies and addopted by the U.S. Global Change
              Research Program.  As its point of departure, the primary goal of OCTET will be
              to characterized physical, geochemical, and biological controls governing the
              regional and vertical partitioning of inorganic and organic carbon pools in the
              world ocean, including the spatial and temporal variations in the partial
              pressure of carbon dioxide in the surface ocean.  The principal investigator
              will manage workshop preparations, execution, and distribution of its
              scientific findings.
