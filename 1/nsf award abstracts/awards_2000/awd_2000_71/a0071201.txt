AST-0071201

This is a collaborative research project with
              Renyue Cen at Princeton University (AST0071153). The goal of this research is
              to construct detailed models (using an Adaptive Mesh Refinement code which
              allows for finer spatial resolution than previous models) of voids and their
              constituent galaxies and compare these models with data from the Sloan Digital
              Sky Survey (SDSS).  These comparisons will then be used to set constraints on
              different cosmological models, the structure and dynamics of voids, and to
              investigate how galaxies form and evolve in a  low density environment. 

The
              investigators propose to study the lowest density regions of the universe
              (called Voids). Voids play a critical role in the evolution of large scale
              structure and galaxy formation in the universe, yet they are poorly understood
              and poorly studied.
The proposors will conduct theoretical computer modeling
              of void formation and test these models by comparing them with observations of
              galaxy densities and spatial distributions obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky
              Survey. Since these computer models will each depend on input parameters which
              are different for different types of cosmology, the comparison will help
              identify which cosmological models are correct. Funding for this project was
              provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology
              (AST/EXC).
