Abstract    :
              The PI proposed to use a balloon borne instrument to measure the flux of muons
              at different depth in the atmosphere.  The muon flux data will be used to
              crosscheck and refine models that deal with the neutrinos produced by cosmic
              rays in the atmosphere.  Such work is essential to understand the neutrino mass
              studies at SuperK, AMANDA, and IceCube.
