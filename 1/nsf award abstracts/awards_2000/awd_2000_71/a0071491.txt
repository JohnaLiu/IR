Abstract    :
              This research program addresses functionally graded thin film shape
memory
              material (nickel titanium) being produced at UCLA.  Shape
memory alloys have
              the property that they return to a memorized
shape when heated.  The material
              developed at UCLA has the unique
capability of two-way actuation, that is it
              returns to a second
shape when cooled.  This project will develop a
              thermomechanical model
for this new material, consisting of a thermal model, a
              mechanical
model, a constitutive relation, and a phase transformation
              model.

This research will enable the design of shape memory alloy
              devices.
For example, it may make it possible to produce small devices on
              the
surfaces of aircraft to reduce drag or control flight.  It will
              enable
the development of new MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical
              systems)
devices.  This advancement may be especially valuable in
              biomedical
applications since nickel titanium is biocompatible.
