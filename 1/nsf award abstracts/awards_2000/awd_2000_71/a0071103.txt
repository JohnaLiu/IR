Abstract    :
              This project is implementing the image and marketing recommendations from "A
              National Agenda for the Future of Engineering Technician Education" published
              January 1997 by Sinclair Community College. The goal is to create a strong,
              positive image of engineering technology education, to market that image to
              prospective students, and ultimately encourage more students to enter the
              profession. The objectives are to: (1) identify components of a strong,
              positive image of engineering technology education, (2) develop a comprehensive
              marketing plan to convey this image to prospective students (3) produce
              appropriate marketing materials to improve the nationwide image of engineering
              technology careers, and (4) disseminate products on a national basis.

In
              this project, Sinclair Community College is partnering with the American
              Society for Engineering Education/Engineering Technology Council, Middlesex
              County College, Motorola University (a division of the Motorola Corporation),
              the University of Central Florida, and the University of Dayton, Engineering
              Technology Department. Additional community colleges across the country are
              pilot testing and disseminating the materials produced.
