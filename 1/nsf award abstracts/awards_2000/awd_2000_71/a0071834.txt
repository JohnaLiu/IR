Abstract    :
               The proposal focuses on problems in Combinatorial Algebra related to
              The
Burnside Problem and to Lie algebras of finite growth. The three
              main
problems are (i) the version of the restricted Burnside problem
              with
periodic primitive elements, (ii) tau-property of Golod -
              Shafarevich
groups and (iii) classification of conformal algebras of
              Gelfand-Kirillov
dimension one.

 These problems are motivated by deep
              applications in Geometry, Topology
and Mathematical Physics.
