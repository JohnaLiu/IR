The proposed research comprises two distinct projects;
              the
relationship between the Novikov and exactness conjectures for
discrete
              groups, and the use of global analytic techniques to study
quantum mechanical
              systems.  The first is motivated by the observation
that the classes of groups
              for which the Novikov and exactness
conjectures are known coincide to a large
              degree; both classes contain
amenable groups, hyperbolic groups and Coxeter
              groups, for example.
This project is joint with J. Kaminker.  The second is
              based on the
idea that the Berezin-Toeplitz quantization can be analyzed
              using
spectral properties of family of Dirac-type operators.  This project
is
              joint with J. Trout.

The Novikov conjecture, one of the most important
              problems in
topology, has stimulated a tremendous amount of mathematical
              research
over the last thirty years.  The exactness conjecture is
              purely
analytic.  That there could exist a connection between these
              two
conjectures from entirely different branches of mathematics is
somewhat
              surprising, but nevertheless is supported by empirical
evidence.  We plan to
              develop more fully the relationship between
these conjectures.  This research
              has bearing on a number of important
outstanding problems including the
              Baum-Connes Conjecture.  At the
heart of the connection between mathematics
              and physics is the theory
of quantum mechanics.  We propose a new method to
              analyze quantum
mechanical systems based on geometric properties of certain
              systems of
differential equations.  This work should lead to a
              better
understanding of a number of quantum mechanical systems
              from
mathematical physics.
