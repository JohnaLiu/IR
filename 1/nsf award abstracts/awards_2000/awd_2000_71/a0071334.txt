Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic program supports
              research on the synthesis and study of small molecule magnets (SMMs) by
              Professor George Christou of the Department of Chemistry at the University of
              Indiana-Bloomington. These molecules behave macroscopically as magnets at low
              temperature but exhibit quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) which is
              responsible for loss of magnetic behavior at increasing temperature. A series
              of new SMMs will be produced from carboxylic acid derivatives of polynuclear
              manganese complexes as well as from some iron compounds. Supramolecular
              aggregates of  SMMs will be synthesized in order to raise the barrier to QTM
              and allow them to operate as magnets at temperatures higher than a few degrees
              Kelvin.

The goal of this research is to develop molecular magnets which
              ultimately can operate at practical temperatures, analogous to the development
              of higher-temperature superconductors. The results of this research will lead
              to an enhanced understanding of the factors which produce magnetic behavior in
              these molecules, as well as to the factors controlling its loss at higher
              temperatures. The students involved in this multidisciplinary project will
              receive broad training which will prepare them for careers in both industry and
              academia.
