A fundamental idea in
              algebraic topology is to study 
topological spaces by attaching to them
              algebraic 
structures which are invariant under deformations.  
A good
              structure will often produce profound relationships 
with other areas of
              mathematics.  Ando and McCarthy 
propose to investigate problems involving
              three such
structures, elliptic cohomology, algebraic K-theory, 
and the
              calculus of functors.  

Ando proposes several projects involving elliptic
              
cohomology, which provides a relationship between 
topology, algebraic
              geometry, and string theory.  
For example, he proposes a new approach to
              the
rigidity theorems for elliptic genera, based on 
the algebraic theory of
              theta functions. McCarthy 
plans to further pursue  his already successful
              
program of using the calculus of functors to better
understand  algebraic
              K-theory.  For example, he 
hopes that ideas from the calculus of functors
              will 
clarify Neeman's K-theory of triangluated categories.  
Ando and
              McCarthy also plan a joint project to
investigate the role of the calculus of
              functors 
in the new homotopy theory of schemes of Voevodsky 
and others.
