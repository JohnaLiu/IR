Abstract    :
              
The inspiral and merger of black holes and neutron
stars are the most
              promising sources of gravitational
wave signals for the Laser Interferometer
              Gravitational
Wave Observatory (LIGO), expected to become operational
in
              2002.  Inspiral signals take the form of chirps,
i.e. signals with
              monotonically increasing frequency.
Methods will be developed for the
              detection of chirped
signals.  Specifically, a new approach, the Fast
Chirp
              Transform (FCT), will be implemented. The FCT
provides a simple and elegant
              formalism for detecting
a broad class of variable frequency signals, and
              is
is a generalization of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
to non-linear
              phase evolution such as that exhibited by
chirped signals.

Development of
              Fast Chirp Transform techniques will
allow fast on-the-fly realization of
              matched filter
detection techniques without the need for generation
of large
              families of binary inspiral signal templates.
FCT techniques will also allow
              enhanced tests for
detector confidence by measuring the false event
rate for
              chirp signals.  Finally, FCT techniques will
be applicable to the detection of
              binary black hole
inspiral by allowing searches over a wider range of
black
              hole spins.
