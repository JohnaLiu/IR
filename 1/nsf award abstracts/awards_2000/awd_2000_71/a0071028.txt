Abstract    :
              This project will carry out LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC)
              research
activities related to the analysis of data from the NSF-funded
              Laser
Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO).  This
              includes
the development and testing of algorithms and data analysis
              techniques
to search for gravitational waves from known
              astrophysical
sources. Since these will produce extremely weak signals, the
              data
analysis problem is to find these signals in a noisy data stream,
where
              the statistical properties of the noise are not straightforward
to
              characterize.  The UWM group is developing and testing data
analysis
              strategies and algorithms which are not adversely affected by
instrumental
              anomalies.  This work includes the writing of both
prototype and production
              codes, which are then tested and compared
with other techniques. The best
              methods are then migrated into the
LIGO Data Analysis System where they can be
              run on very large data
sets.

This work is crucial to the success of LIGO,
              which is an NSF-funded
project to detect gravitational waves of astrophysical
              origin.  Such
waves are emitted by astrophysical sources such as coalescing
              pairs of
binary neutron stars, supernovae, and pulsars, but are very weak
              and
have never been directly observed.  This is why new and specialized
types
              of data analysis methods are needed.  Direct observation would
confirm a
              fundamental prediction of physics -- the existence of
gravitational waves --
              and provide a unique tool for observing exotic
astrophysical phenomena.  The
              two LIGO observatories are located in
Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA, and have
              been under construction since
1995; they will be completed and operating
              sometime during 2001.
