This award provides partial support for the
              featured speakers and for some graduate students to attend the 2000 Albany
              Group Theory Conference.  The conference will be the eleventh in a series of
              conferences dedicated to the interplay between group theory and topology. 
              There will be seven main speakers, each of whom will give a one hour talk.  In
              addition, there will be 20 - 25 short talks by participants.  The conference
              will be held at the Rensselaerville Conference Center in October of 2000.
