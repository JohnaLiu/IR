              ABSTRACT

 A lacuna of a linear hyperbolic differential operator is a
domain
              inside the propagation cone where its fundamental     
solution vanishes
              identically. The study of lacunas for general
hyperbolic equations was
              initiated by I.G.Petrovsky (1945).
Extending and clarifying his results,
              Atiyah, Bott and Garding
(1970-73) developed a profound and complete theory
              for hyperbolic
operators with constant coefficients. In contrast, much less is
               
known about lacunas for operators with variable coefficients. 
The
              investigation of this classical problem with a view of
generalizing the
              Petrovsky-Atiyah-Bott-Garding theory is one of 
the primary purposes of my
              project. In particular, the
efforts will be aimed at resolving the old
              question of
J.Hadamard on explicit determination of second order
              analytic
wave operators satisfying Huygens' principle on Minkowski
spaces.
              Some new conjectures and problems (mostly from Analysis   
and Algebraic
              Geometry) arising in connection with the theory
of lacunas will be also
              explored.

 The study of propagation of waves in continuous media is one
              of
the fundamental problems in Mathematical Physics with many 
important
              applications in natural sciences and engineering. 
Of special interest (both
              from practical and theoretical point of view) 
is the question of when the
              waves may propagate without diffusion 
to allow the possibility of
              transmitting `clean-cut' (sharp) signals. 
Well-studied in homogeneous spaces
              this question remains largely open 
in general. My project aims to develop new
              mathematical tools 
and techniques to investigate this difficult problem in
              the case of
inhomogeneous and anisotropic media. The results sought are of
              fundamental
interest and significance in mathematical theory of wave
              propagation 
and may have applications in related physical disciplines
              including the
theory of electromagnetic and acoustic waves, space
              communication
technologies, magnetohydrodynamics, crystal optics, etc.
