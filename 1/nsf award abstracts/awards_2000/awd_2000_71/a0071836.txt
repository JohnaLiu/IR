Mendillo, Michael

A renewal of a 3-year grant to operate the
              CEDAR Optical Tomographic Imaging Facility (COTIF) and for the scientific
              analysis of the results obtained is proposed in which COTIF capabilities will
              be applied to several aspects of sub-auroral physics related to sources of
              stable red auroral (SAR) arcs.  Now that solar maximum is approaching, the
              re-appearance of SAR arcs in late 1998 offers the first ever opportunity to
              study the latitude-altitude dependence of volume emission rates for SAR arcs,
              the only possible way to access the height-dependent excitation physics. 
              Issues of thermal excitation, high speed convection excitation, and
              augmentation of emission by proton precipitation can now be addressed.  To
              conduct the latter study, the PI proposes to field a CEDAR funded
              high-throughput-imaging-Eschell-spectrograph (HITIES).  Modeling expertise for
              SAR arc mechanisms is in place, and a leading expert on proton modeling will
              join the group as part of another program.

New to this effort is the
              application of imaging science capabilities from COTIF and HITIES to the study
              of mesospheric gravity waves.  A CEDAR Post-doctoral award to Dr. Steven Smith
              will allow for the study of wave sources and dissipation mechanisms from these
              datasets.  With new FPI and LIDAR instruments being installed at Millstone Hill
              for the CEDAR-TIMED collaboration, a truly robust set of optical diagnostics
              will finally be in place for the first comprehensive study of wave activity at
              a sub-auroral site.
