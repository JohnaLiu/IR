This project in the area of
              dynamical systems concerns two main areas of investigation.  First, it
              investigates singularly perturbed systems with turning points, a class of
              dynamical systems that occur in applications involving multi-scale physical
              phenomena. The presence of turning points, where some eigenvalues of
              linearization along the slow variables change sign, indicates stability loss of
              the slow dynamic and complicates dynamical behavior.  This project extends
              geometric singular perturbation theory to classes of problems to which current
              theory cannot be applied directly.  Second, the project investigates the
              phenomenon of synchronization in systems of non-identical coupled oscillators. 
              The main focus is on the effects of diffusive couplings and individual
              dissipations on synchronizations and their stabilities.

The theory of
              dynamical systems has application to a wide array of natural systems that
              change in time, from the transmission of disease to the motion of planets and
              spacecraft.  This project investigates two open problems in dynamical systems
              whose solution will advance the theory and as a result allow prediction and
              control of important natural systems.  Results of the project will have
              significant impact on the understanding of multi-scale phenomena in biology,
              fluid dynamics, electrical circuit design, and other areas.
