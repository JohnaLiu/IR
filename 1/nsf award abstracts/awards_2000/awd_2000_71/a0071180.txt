Ferland

In this project, PI  Ferland will implement major
              improvements in the plasma simulation code CLOUDY. This computer model of a low
              density, hot plasma is a mainstay of the astronomical community. It is freely
              available on the web ( http://nimbus.pa.uky.edu/cloudy/c90.htm ) and is used to
              generate theoretical emission line spectra which are used in the analysis of a
              wide variety of astrophysical objects, with special emphasis on the spectra of
              Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). The  proposed improvements to CLOUDY will make
              use of the recent advances in computer technology which allow it to use faster
              processors. The goal is to render a more physically realistic spectrum both in
              the Infrared as well as the multi level hydrogen emission line spectrum of
              Quasars.

Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for
              Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).
