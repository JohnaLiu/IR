The goal
              of the first project is to obtain new relations in the
cohomology of the
              moduli space of complex structures on a marked
Riemann surface.  Using
              techniques developed in her earlier work,
the PI found several interesting
              relations, one of which could
prove the Faber conjecture about the generators
              of the
tautological ring. The second project seeks to find relations
between
              the relative and absolute Gromov-Witten invariants.  Such
relations appear to
              be useful in mirror conjecture computations,
as well as in several other open
              problems in enumerative
geometry. The final project suggests two ways of
              extending the
Gromov-type invariants to `nongeneric' situations.  This
              would
provide more refined information about the symplectic manifold.
 
              
Most of the problems in enumerative algebraic geometry are more
than a
              hundred years old. The questions are easy to ask, but the
progress in solving
              them using classical methods has been quite
slow. Recently, the same kind of
              questions arised in two
dimensional topological quantuum field theories from
              high energy
physics. Inspired by these theories, new methods lead in the
              past
couple of years to amazing progress in the field.  The proposal
explores
              two new ways of approaching these old problems that
would further clarify the
              structure of the two dimensional
topological quantuum field theories.
