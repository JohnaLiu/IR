Abstract    :
                  This project is an investigation of the nighttime chemistry of isoprene
              (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene) in a rural forested area.  Previous studies have
              observed surprisingly rapid nighttime decay of this reactive biogenic
              hydrocarbon.  Recent observations suggest that the rapid decay is caused by
              unexpectedly large nighttime concentrations of OH radicals.  This study will
              examine the reactivity of nighttime air using tower and airborne measurements
              of isoprene and several anthropogenic alkenes.  This research will be conducted
              as part of the Program for Research on Oxidants, Photochemistry, Emissions, and
              Transport (PROPHET) at Pellston, Michigan.
