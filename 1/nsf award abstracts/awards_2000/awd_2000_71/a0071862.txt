The
              two main subjects of the proposed research are Teichmueller
spaces of compact
              Riemann surfaces of genus greater than one and
the universal Teichmueller
              space, which can be identified with
the diffeomorphism group of the circle. 
              There is a natural
Riemannian metric on both classical and universal
              Teichmueller
spaces, called the Weil-Petersson metric.  Although those
              spaces
are not symmetric spaces, and there are no classical Lie groups
acting
              on them isometrically (unlike the hyperbolic spaces with
the special linear
              group), one notes that on the classical
Teichmueller spaces the mapping class
              group of the Riemann
surfaces acts isometrically, and that on the
              universal
Teichmueller space the diffeomorphism group of the circle
              acts
isometrically.  These group actions on Teichmueller spaces can
              be
utilized to construct flat bundles over various manifolds with
its fibers
              being copies of Teichmueller spaces, which leads to
the questions of
              strong/super rigidity.  It is in this context
that the investigator intends to
              use the Weil-Petersson geometry
of Teichmueller spaces.

The subject of
              Riemann surfaces has been one of the central
themes of modern mathematics over
              the last two centuries.  In
recent years, it has received renewed attention
              due to the
interest created by the so-called super-string theory, with
              which
physicists hope to construct the grand unifying theory (GMT)
              of
graviation and quantum physics.  The Teichmueller space, which is
the
              subject of this investigation, plays an important role since
it is known to
              parametrizes the "shapes of the string."
Interactions between mathematics and
              theoretical physics have
proved to be fruitful for both sides, and it is
              the
investigator's belief that the proposed research may offer some
new way
              of understanding the outstanding issues in the relevant
scientific fields.
