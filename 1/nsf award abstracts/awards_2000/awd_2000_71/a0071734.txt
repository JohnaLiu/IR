Abstract    :
              Near field scanning optical microscopy is used in this research project
              supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to obtain information
              on the relationship between the morphology of organic thin films and their
              physical properties.  Professor Barbara and his colleagues at the University of
              Texas-Austin address issues of charge injection, charge migration, and energy
              migration in organic thin film materials with applications in organic light
              emitting diodes and related devices.  Method development carried out in the
              previous award period resulted in approaches which are now focussed on
              understanding the spatial extent of energy migration in these materials, and
              the nature of energetic interactions in the layers.  Information obtained from
              these studies is useful in the design and fabrication of state of the art
              optoelectronic devices. 

In order to understand the operation of organic
              thin film light emitting devices, and related optoelectronic materials, high
              resolution spatial information about physical processes and morphology in the
              films must be obtained.  This research project uses near field scanning probe
              microscopic methods developed by the P.I. to examine these questions. 
              Information from this research is clearly applicable in electronic and photonic
              device fabrication problems.
