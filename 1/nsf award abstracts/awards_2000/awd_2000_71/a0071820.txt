This
              project involves topological  and geometric aspects of the

theory of
              three-dimensional Seiberg-Witten monopoles and it

addresses two general
              guiding questions. The first question is

about the topological significance
              of  the  monopole count. Meng

and Taubes have shown that   on a
              three-manifold with nontrivial

homology this count is given by 
              Reidemeister-Turaev torsion. In

the case of rational homology spheres
              numerical experiments with

Seifert manifolds suggest that a suitably altered
               monopole count

 determine in a very elegant fashion both

the
              Casson-Walker invariant and the Reidemeister-Turaev torsion.

The first part
              of the project is devoted to proving this. The

second question is about the
              geometric meaning of

three-dimensional monopoles. The link of a complex
              surface

singularity is  endowed with a natural CR geometry and it
              is

natural to ask how much of it does a monopole capture. More

precisely
              we  address the following fundamental question: how do

monopoles "look like"
              as  the link of the singularity collapses

onto the exceptional divisor of a
              resolution of the singularity?





The three-dimensional world    has
              been a source of inspiration

for many important developments in algebraic
              topology.  It is

within the reach of our physical intuition   so some
              visualization

is possible (think of a cube) yet there is plenty of room
              for

surprises (think of gluing in pairs the opposite faces of the

cube).
              One modern point of view is that, if presented in a

favorable light, the
              three-dimensional world will reveal its

mysteries. The mathematicians  
              phrase this in a more sober way.

If  one can find a nice geometry on  a
              three-manifold then one can

unlock some of its topological features. The
              monopoles are

geometric objects introduced to the mathematical world
              by

physicists. One could think of them as "signals" produced by
              a

three-dimensional space. These ``signals'' depend on  how we look

at
              the manifold.  Since they appeared on the mathematical scene

they have
              provided us with surprising insights about the structure

of low-dimensional
              worlds. This project is about counting these

"signals" in a meaningful way
              and then understanding the

significance of each one of them individually
              when observed under

a favorable light.
