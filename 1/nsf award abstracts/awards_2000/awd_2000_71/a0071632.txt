Abstract    :
              This project has as its long-term goal the development of chemosensing molecules
              that bind metal ions and signal specific metal ion binding.  The specific aims
              of this study are to design and synthesize peptide derived macrocyclic ligands
              with an intrinsic fluorescent signal to indicate metal ion binding.  The
              strategy is to employ peptide based macrocycles incorporating intrinsic
              signalling molecules that display a fluorescence response.  The ion binding
              selectivities will be comparatively studied by NMR, CD, potentiometry and
              fluorescence techniques.  Ground state properties of these macrocycles, in the
              solid state as well as in solution, will be investigated by X-ray diffraction
              methods, NMR and conformational analysis.

With this Award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program's Organic Dynamics Program supports the
              research of Professor Maria Ngu-Schwemlein of Southern University.  Professor
              Ngu-Schwemlein proposes to study the interactions between metal ions and small
              molecules that are modeled on proteins.  With a detectable interaction between
              these molecules and specific ions, applications toward ion selective sensors,
              ion chromatography, and metal ion detoxification will be possible.
