Abstract    :
              This is a standard award.    Automated systems that interact with human users in
              spoken and written communication will greatly enhance productivity and program
              usability.    These systems will allow friendly access to information services
              and are essential for people with disabilities, or for accessing databases
              while performing intricate tasks.    Unfortunately, current technology is
              inadequate for the tasks at hand, and there is a need to make progress.    The
              number of available personnel trained in the field must be vastly increased and
              solutions to long standing problems must be found.    At this time, relatively
              few universities educate students capable of performing the required tasks.   
              Leading professionals are scattered in various industrial, academic, and
              governmental institutions, often duplicating each other's work.    This award
              will allow a summer workshop on language engineering to be conducted where
              mixed teams of leading professionals and students can cooperate to advance the
              state of the art.    The professionals will normally be university professors
              and industrial and government researchers working in widely dispersed
              locations.    Graduate and undergraduate students will join these teams.    The
              participation of undergraduate students is intended not only as an educational
              opportunity, but also to broaden the appeal of the language engineering field
              amongst students considering graduate studies.
