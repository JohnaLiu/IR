Abstract    :
              This RUI (Research in Undergraduate Institutions) award supports the acquisition
              of atmospheric chemistry and aerosol instrumentation. The package will consist
              of an air sampler to collect particulate matter; a microbalance, and ion
              chromatograph, and an instrument to quantify aerosol carbonaceous matter;
              instruments to measure the gas phase concentrations of ozone, sulfur dioxide,
              nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and dioxide; and a portable meteorological
              tower to measure the temperature, humidity, pressure and wind speed and
              direction. The principal investigator will use this instrumentation for
              undergraduate instruction, including field projects at San Jose, California,
              and in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.
