Abstract    :
              This project will perform a systematic investigation of the entry of solar wind
              ions into the magnetosphere.  Particles will be followed from the solar wind,
              through the magnetopause, and then into the various regions of the
              magnetosphere.  It will determine whether there are mechanisms other than
              magnetic reconnection that allow a significant number of ions access to the
              magnetosphere and will also address the question of what contribution the
              ionosphere makes to the ion population.  The project will utilize the results
              from prior MHD modeling of the magnetosphere to define the state of the
              magnetosphere and then will utilize a test-particle tracing technique to follow
              ions from the solar wind into the magnetosphere
