This theoretical research award supports work to explore
              spin-dependent tunneling and hopping conduction in semiconductor-based magnetic
              nanocomposites and heterostructures.  If successful, the research will
              facilitate the development of novel quantum devices which merge magnetism with
              semiconductor technologies.  Three projects will be done:  (1) theoretical
              studies of non-coherent spin-dependent transport in nanocomposites of
              GaAs/Rare-Earth-Group-V and GaAs/Mn-based compounds, as well as III-V and
              IV-VI-based dilute magnetic semiconductors with a random and clustered
              distribution of magnetic ions; (2) a theoretical study of coherent
              spin-dependent transport in confined magnetic structures such as magnetic
              quantum wells and quantum dots, e.g., ErAs or GaMnAs quantum wells in GaAs, and
              ErAs, MnAs or MnGa quantum dots in GaAs; first-principles electronic structure
              calculations of bulk and confined magnetic materials and their interfaces with
              III-V semiconductors.

This theoretical research will explore properties
              of magnetic materials and behavior integrated with semiconductors in the form
              of quantum dots and heterostructures.  While providing a rich field of
              fundamental phenomena, these materials hold great promise for device
              applications.
