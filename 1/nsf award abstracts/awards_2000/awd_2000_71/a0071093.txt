Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21) 
This project is enhancing the two-year mathematics
              curriculum by providing teachers with classroom ready materials that
              demonstrate real applications of mathematics and inform teachers and students
              about jobs in industry and the mathematical skills used in those jobs. The
              principal investigators are conducting four summer workshops (two each summer)
              for secondary and community college mathematics faculty. During these workshops
              faculty teams, consisting of investigators and workshop participants, are
              visiting industries to see first hand how graduates of two-year AAS programs
              are using mathematics. The graduates are interviewed and videotaped as they
              explain and demonstrate how mathematical concepts and methodologies are used
              and how problems are resolved in their jobs. Based on the visit and the
              mathematical topics discussed, a series of snapshots, video clips, and
              accompanying worksheets are being developed and packaged both on a CD and for
              distribution via the Internet. Information about the project is being presented
              at local, state and national conferences.
