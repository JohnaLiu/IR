Abstract    :
              This award supported by the Division of International Programs allows Marianthi
              Ierapetritou of Rutgers University to collaborate with Prof. Anna S.
              Hauksdottir of the University of Iceland in Reykjavik.  The project will
              develop methods and solutions for the control of multiple-input multiple-output
              systems by simultaneous decoupling and pole placement with canceling the
              invariant zeros that arise in classical methods.  In contrast to other methods,
              this procedure will give the system feedback robustness.

This project will
              combine classical control theory with state-of-the-art advances in optimization
              and process systems engineering.  The method should alleviate problems that
              exist with other modern techniques and can have an impact in better
              understanding the fundamental limitations, constraints, and trade-offs in
              feedback control systems.  The results should impact the application of the
              method to chemical engineering problems as well as to multiple-input
              multiple-output problems in general.
