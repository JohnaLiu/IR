Abstract    :
              This proposal considers fundamental statistical research into the theories
              governing clustering of multivariate objects and variables, and the
              interrelation of classification and probability in prediction and explanation. 
              The emphases will be on classification probabilities, probability matching,
              probability searching algorithms, topological and block clustering, and
              multimodality.

Applications of these techniques include grouping and
              ultimate identification of biological entities, the analysis of block voting
              behavior and the determination of multimodal collections in large databases.
