Abstract    :
              
Research in theoretical physics will include work on
supersymmetric field
              theories and superstring theory. Supersymmetric field theories hypothesize that
              for every elementary particle known, there is another particle with very
              closely related properties. These theories are important because they may be
              the correct explanation of why the weak nuclear force is not very much weaker
              than we observe it to be. Superstring theory is important because it is the
              most promising unified theory of all the fundamental forces, including gravity;
              it is also leading to the development of new tools for performing calculations
              in other theories, such as the one which describes the strong nuclear
              force.
