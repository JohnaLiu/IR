Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical high-energy physics will focus on the exploration of
              novel ideas for physics beyond the Standard Model of the elementary particles
              particularly those new ideas that arise from the interplay between string
              theory and traditional particle physics.  In recent years, this interplay has
              had a dramatic effect in reshaping our understanding of the theoretical (and
              indeed the experimental) possibilities for physics beyond the Standard Model. 
              Such new ideas span a very broad range of energies, and include the possibility
              of large extra spatial dimensions. 
	The exploration of the new ideas is
              important to the expansion of our intellectual horizons, and to the planning of
              future experiments.
