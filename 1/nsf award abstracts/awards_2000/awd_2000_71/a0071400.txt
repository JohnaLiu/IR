Abstract    :
              	Research in theoretical physics will include work on superstring theory,
              including studies of underlying unifying structure and its applications for
              deeper understanding of quantum field theories.  Superstring theory is the only
              known candidate for unifying all known forces of nature.  Moreover, the
              insights and tools it provides for understanding quantum chromodyamics, the
              theory of the strong nuclear force, are invaluable.
