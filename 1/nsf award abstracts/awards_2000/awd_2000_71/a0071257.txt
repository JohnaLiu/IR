The goals of this proposal are to study the properties
              and  implications of the damped Lyman-alpha absorption systems seen in quasar 
              spectra. The PI's earlier work suggests that Ly-alpha systems are the gaseous 
              progenitors of most normal galaxies with  kinematics and ionization levels
              which indicate absorption in moving, presumably merging,  clumps rather than
              smooth disks. The PI has started a numerically-intensive simulation program to
              examine consistency between the observations and cosmological
              parameters.

The object of this proposal is to find and observe the ancestors
              of typical current galaxies; i.e., protogalaxies. Current theories, (for
              example, cold dark matter cosmologies (CDM)),  predict that most protogalaxies
              were much less massive than current galaxies. Thus, the starlight emitted by
              exceedingly distant protogalaxies  is too faint to detect by conventional
              techniques. By contrast the surveys for neutral gas discussed in this proposal
              are capable of detecting low-mass objects.
Since stars in current galaxies
              have formed  out of interstellar gas for the past 10 billion years, most of the
              ordinary matter in protogalaxies must have been gas. We detect the gas in
              absorption against the bright light emitted by even more distant quasars. The
              principal signature of gaseous protogalaxies is strong absorption in the
              hydrogen Lyman - alpha line. In principle we can detect low-mass objects since
              the  absorption strength of the gas is  insensitive to variations of the mass
              of the protogalaxy. In this work, the PIs will use the two Keck 10 m telescopes
              to test predictions of CDM, studying the velocity structure of the neutral and
              ionized gas to determine whether gas motions are generated by rotating disks or
              some other mechanism. and measuring the abundance of heavy elements  in order
              to trace chemical enrichment of galaxies over cosmic time scales. and searching
              for emission of starlight from galaxies associated with the absorbing gas.
              These observations will be compared with numerical simulations of the formation
              of damped Lyman - alpha systems in CDM cosmologies. Funding for this project
              was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology
              (AST/EXC).
