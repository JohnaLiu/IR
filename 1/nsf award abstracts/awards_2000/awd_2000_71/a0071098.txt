Abstract    :
              	This proposal requests support for the research program of the high energy
              physics group at the University of Washington to continue their hadron collider
              work on [1] the D0 detector at Fermilab and [2] on construction of the ATLAS
              detector for the LHC program to be run at the CERN laboratory in Geneva
              Switzerland.
On the D0 experiment, the Washington group has
              major
responsibility for the D0 detector upgrade currently under way;
              specifically, the Level 3 Trigger / Data Acquisition System and forward muon
              system.  The group is also committed to full participation in the installation
              and commissioning of the upgraded detector.  In March 2001 the D0 detector is
              scheduled to resume data taking, and this group will have an ongoing major
              responsibility for operation of both the L3 Trigger/DAQ and forward muon
              systems.  They are also committed to D0's Run 2 physics program and will work
              in the top and Higgs physics groups.
On the ATLAS experiment, this group has
              central
responsibility for the design of the critical support structure and
              kinematic mounts for the ATLAS forward muon chambers.  They will fabricate a
              total of 96 forward chambers, of which about 48 will be complete in the period
              2000 - 2002.  This group has assumed the lead responsibility for the design of
              the control system for all of the ATLAS muon detectors.  This work will start
              with the design and implementation of a control system for the muon test
              beam.
