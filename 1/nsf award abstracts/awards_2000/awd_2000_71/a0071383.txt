Abstract

Periodicities
              naturally arise in data involving tides, climatology,
ecology, sociology,
              astronomy, economics, hydrology, etc..  This research
studies general periodic
              time series modeling methods along with some
applications to climatological
              problems.  The specific questions examined
here include efficient computation
              of the autocovariance structure of
periodic time series models, parsimonious
              periodic time series model
development, changepoint and homogeneity methods,
              and trend properties in
monthly average and extreme temperatures.  The
              mathematical and
statistical methods center on periodic autoregressive moving
              average
models (PARMA) time series models - the fundamental modeling vehicle
              for
periodic series.  An efficient algorithm to compute the
              autocovariance
structure of a PARMA model will be explored.  Changepoint and
              homogeneity
methods for periodic series, an issue that arises when weather
              recording
stations move, will also be investigated. 

The developed
              mathematical and statistical results are used to settle
some climatological
              problems.  A study of the trends in monthly
temperature means and extremes
              from United States stations will be
conducted.  This detailed study will
              enhance our understanding of
climate change and global warming.  The
              changepoint aspect is perhaps
the data's most important feature. 
              Periodicities in the autocovariances
in the data need to be parsimoniously
              modeled to compute accurate
standard errors.  Standard errors are needed to
              gauge the reliability of
the computed trends.  The methods also yield improved
              forecasts of
periodic series as a byproduct.
