Abstract    :
              
This project is creating a partnership to develop curriculum concurrently with
              emerging technology for Fieldbus and Process Control Systems (PCS) Maintenance
              Education. This partnership of higher education institutions and national
              industries is writing curriculum modules that interrelate the technical
              programs of computer maintenance and networking, electrical, instrumentation,
              and process technologies because these programs are affected by industries that
              focus on process and computer network technologies. Faculty enhancement
              activities are assuring that faculty and teachers in the consortium are
              prepared to teach the courses.

Another important aspect of the Center is the
              creation of laboratories that 
duplicate the working arrangements for
              technicians. These laboratories serve students and industry as applied research
              facilities that emulate an actual working site rather than an academic
              laboratory. 

The educational partners represent both school districts and
              institutions of higher education. Some of them are Lamar University, College of
              the Mainland, and Del Mar College in Corpus Christi, Texas. Some of the 21
              industry partners supporting the Center are Bayer Corporation, DuPont, Exxon
              USA, Fisher-Rosemont, Kellogg Brown & Root, and Siemens Energy & Automation.
