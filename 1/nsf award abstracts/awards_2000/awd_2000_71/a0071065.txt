              Abstract

The principal investigator proposes to continue his work on
              special
values of L-functions and their relation to arithmetic geometry.
The 
              proposed research would improve our understanding of both
automorphic forms
              and p-adic cohomology  by providing new tools for
studying the former and by
              providing concrete examples of the latter.
Specifically, the research would
              extend the applicability of Explicit
Reciprocity Laws to include p-adic
              analytic families of galois
representations.  This, in turn, would provide a
              new tool for
studying the arithmetic properties of two-variable
              p-adic
L-functions.  It would also clarify how analytic families of
              galois
representations degenerate at semistable non-crystalline points
              and
would describe monodromy  at such points in terms of a deformation in
the
              weight direction, thus enlarging the standard picture of
monodromy in
              potentially useful ways.  This research would also
complement Kato's recent
              work on values of L-functions and K-theory of
modular curves by providing
              tools for deforming Kato's theory in
p-adic analytic families.  In related
              work, the PI hopes to develop
a p-adic Eichler-Shimura correspondence that
              would relate his
theory of  overconvergent modular symbols to Katz's theory
              of
overconvergent modular forms and to construct analytic families
              of
non-ordinary half-integral weight modular forms by generalizing a
p-adic
              theta lifting developed in earlier work of the PI. Finally,
the PI intends to
              generalize these ideas to automorphic forms on
other reductive algebraic
              groups.  This research offers promising
tools for the construction of p-adic
              analytic families of
non-ordinary automorphic representations together with
              natural
deformation spaces of Galois representations, and
multivariable
              p-adic L-functions.   This is connected with a
number of investigations, 
              including p-adic monodromy, Jochnowitz's
conjectures on the square root of the
              theta operator,  and  the
p-adic deformation theory of Galois
              representations.


The investigations of this proposal belong to the
              general
mathematical area of Arithmetic Geometry.  This ultramodern
              research
area combines two of the oldest branches of mathematics: 
              number
theory and geometry.   New insights arising out of this
combination
              are producing increasingly powerful tools to solve
longstanding problems like
              Fermat's Last Theorem, which have
resisted the strongest efforts of over three
              centuries of
mathematicians.  In addition, though Arithmetic Geometry is
              sometimes
regarded as the purest of pure mathematics, it has also
              been
developing insightful new techniques  leading to dramatic progress
              in
such applied areas as error-correcting codes and cryptography.
