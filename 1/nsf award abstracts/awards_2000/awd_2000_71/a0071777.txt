Abstract    :
              This project, which is supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program
              develops new electrochemical methods for studying membrane-bound enzymes in
              complex media.  Conducted by Dr. Albert Sneden and his group at Virginia
              Commonwealth University, the project prepares and characterizes stable
              assemblies of cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) adsorbed on a lipid bilayer that is
              anchored into a silver-coated gold electrode. A quartz crystal microbabance is
              used to coat the electrode with an optimum layer of silver. The electrode is
              then covered with octadectyl mercaptan to form an anchor for the bilayer. 
              Atomic Force Microscopy is used to confirm the structure of the membrane.
              Electrochemical experiments have confirmed that such a bilayer mimics the in
              vivo reactivities of CCO. The known reaction between cyanide and CCO forms the
              basis for these studies. The electron transfer reaction between reduced
              cytochrome under flow conditions, CCO in the bilayer, and the electrode is
              characterized as a function of  cyanide concentration, steady state turnover
              rate, and oxygen concentration.  This research develops new electrochemical
              methods for studying membrane-bound enzymes in complex media.  Results from
              this research  will be useful for assessing the  potential efficacy of
              compounds as enzyme inhibitors and will be important in areas such as drug
              testing.
