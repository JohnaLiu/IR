Abstract    :
               
 

This is a proposal to support graduate students to attend the Third
              International Workshop
on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control, to be held
              March 23-25, 2000, in Pittsburgh,
PA. The goal of this workshop is to provide
              an international forum for presenting novel
results, methodologies, and tools
              for the design of hybrid dynamic systems. The term
'hybrid systems' has
              emerged over the past few years to describe the increasing number
              of
computer-controlled systems that require a mixture of continuous and
              discrete state
variables to be modeled effectively. The lack of a
              satisfactory, cost-effective
methodologies for designing reliable and
              efficient hybrid systems is widely acknowledged.
It is the purpose of the
              workshops on hybrid systems to develop a scientific community
and a body of
              knowledge that synthesizes discrete and continuous technologies. The
meeting
              will include four invited plenary speakers and more than 30
              contributed
presentations selected by a program committee from submitted
              extended abstracts.
Attendance of approximately 100 researchers is expected.
              This proposal asks for financial
support for approximately 20 graduate
              students to attend the workshop.
