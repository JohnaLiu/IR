This is a grant to support theoretical research on the physics
              of correlated electrons.  The quintessential example of strongly correlated
              physics is the fractional quantum Hall effect.  In very strong magnetic fields
              the kinetic energy is completely degenerate, and the dynamics is determined by
              interactions alone.  The focus of the research is to investigate quantum phase
              transitions between possible phases of electrons in strong magnetic fields as
              various external tunable parameters (such as Landau-level mixing, sample
              thickness, disorder, and the Zeeman energy) are varied.  A new approach
              developed by the PI with Shankar will be used, supplemented by standard
              techniques.  The states to be studied include: fractional quantum Hall liquid;
              Wigner crystal; Hall crystal; p-wave superconducting composite fermion states
              and their inhomogeneous generalizations.

              will study a variety of configurations of these systems.  The results will be
              of fundamental importance and will possibly provide insight into device
              applications.
