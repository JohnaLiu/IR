Abstract    :
              A joint research project in theoretical elementary particle physics
involving
              US institutions (Iowa State and SUNY at Stony Brook) and two
institutions of
              the Russian Academy of Sciences (St. Petersburg Nuclear
Physics Institute and
              Institute for Nuclear Research, Moscow) will address
the production of "J/Psi"
              particles in high-energy collisions.  Precision
calculations of the rate for
              production of these particles predicted by
Quantum Chromodynamics, the theory
              of the strong nuclear force, will be
performed.  Our ability to measure the
              J/Psi production rate in both low
momentum and high momentum regions makes the
              J/Psi a unique probe for
exploring the strong nuclear force in physical
              situations where it is
neither weak nor extremely strong. The calculations to
              be carried out are
important to the improvement of our understanding of
              Quantum
Chromodynamics and our confidence in it, and to the furthering of
              our
understanding of the strong nuclear force.
