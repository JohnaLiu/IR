Abstract    :
              A class of tilings of Euclidean spaces, the best known being the Penrose tilings
              of the plane, have proven to be a fertile subject of research with impact in a
              broad range of directions. The investigator continues his interdisciplinary
              research of these tilings, emphasizing consequences of the statistical
              rotational symmetry of the tilings, in particular the full rotational symmetry
              of tilings such as the pinwheel tilings of the plane. The methods are a
              combination  of ergodic theory, ring theory and algebraic topology.

Tilings
              of space have been an important tool to understand the geometric relationships
              that are possible between many small components within a larger whole. In
              particular tilings help us understand geometric symmetries. In recent years
              tilings with unexpected symmetries have been discovered, and used successfully
              in modeling the atomic structure of new types of physical materials. The
              investigator studies these new symmetries, and, making use of the way tilings
              interface with various parts of mathematics, uses the symmetries as a tool to
              investigate structures in diverse parts of mathematics.
