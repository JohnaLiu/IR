This project will
              investigate the theory and applications of equivariant dynamical systems.  In
              particular, using the symmetries of differential equations and models, we will
              study patterns that occur both in space and in time.  We will explore locomotor
              central pattern generators for bipeds and quadrupeds, a classification of
              bursting types, hypermeander of spiral waves, and magnetic dynamos.  We will
              also study a combination of Euclidean symmetry and chaotic dynamics that leads
              to a deterministic mechanism for stochastic Brownian motion, and
              Ginzburg-Landau theory for spatially-extended systems.

Patterns appear in
              physical, chemical, and biological systems in both space and time and are
              striking and reproducible.  Often these patterns result from symmetries, and
              our research will study pattern formation by further developing the theory and
              application of symmetric dynamical systems.  Applications that will be
              investigated range from the study of muscle rhythms in animal gaits and
              intermittency in magnetic dynamos to the complicated ways in which bursting
              signals are produced and spiral waves move.
