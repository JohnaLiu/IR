Abstract    :
              DMS-0071494

Dr. Meyer will  work on a variety of problems involving the
              $N$-body problem,
Hamiltonian systems and dynamical systems. Building on his
              recent work with 
Dr. McCord on the integral manifolds of the spatial three
              body problem he will 
study the geometry and homology of the {\it regularized}
              (compactified)
integral 
manifolds of the spatial three-body problem.  These
              are eight-dimensional
algebraic
sets which vary with the masses, energy and
              angular momentum of the particles. 
These computations should refute Birkhoff
              conjecture, yield information on the
existence of cross 
sections, and answer
              the Birkhoff question on cross sections in the negative as
they did  in the
              non-regularized problem. As another application of the rich
topology found in
              the integral manifolds of the three-body problem, he will use
variational
              arguments to establish new classes of periodic solutions. Dr. Meyer
will also
              work on (i) simplifying the proof of the existence of Xia diffusion
in the
              three-body problem; (ii) the existence of comet-like 
periodic orbits in the
              N-body problem; (iii)  establishing the stability of an
equilibrium point of a
              Hamiltonian system in the case of 1:1 resonance; and
(iv) the evolution and
              bifurcation of invariant manifolds of a Hamiltonian
system which depend on a
              parameter. 



Dr. Meyer will work on a number of problems in the
              qualitative theory of the
equations 
which describe the motion of mechanical
              systems and celestial bodies, namely
Hamiltonian systems.  One of the
              important equations of this type is the N-body
problem which describes 
the
              motion of N masses -- the planets.  Systems of this type typically
              conserve
energy and momentum and these conservation laws place global
              restrictions on
the possible motion of the bodies.  Dr. Meyer has an ongoing
              research program
studying the ramifications of these 
conserved quantities on
              the nature of the motion.  Dr. Meyer will also
investigate the existence of
              regular and chaotic motions in these systems and
how these types of motions
              depend of various physical parameters.  One type of
regular motion he will
              establish is 
periodic motions in the N-body problem and one type of chaotic
              motion he will
try to establish is known as Xia diffusion. Dr. Meyer will also
              study the
evolution of the stable manifold of equilibrium solutions i.e. the
              evolution of
the set of solutions which tend to 
an equilibrium (the stable
              manifold).
