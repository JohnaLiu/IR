The IEEE Solid-States Circuits Society is
              sponsoring the 2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuit Conference (ISSCC
              2000 will be held in San Francisco, CA  from 7 to 9 February 2000.  The central
              conference theme is "ICS for the 21st Century Systems."

This project
              requests travel support to defray the travel expenses for students whose papers
              have been selected for presentation at the Conference, but who lack funds and
              might not be able to attend without travel support.  The total amount requested
              is $4,000 on the basis of an average travel grant of $500 for 8 participants. 
              ISSCC 2000 will be matching the funds awarded.
