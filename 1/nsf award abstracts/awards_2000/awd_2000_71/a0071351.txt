Gas phase pulsed corona reactors have been used for the
              degradation and removal of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur
              dioxide and volatile organic compounds from combustion gases and other gaseous
              waste streams.  A pulsed streamer corona discharge creates streamer channels
              that propagate from one electrode to the other and that typically have
              relatively small diameter.  These streamers lead to the formation of chemically
              reactive degradation of conversion to less harmful byproducts of many
              pollutants.

The PI's are working on reticulated vitreous carbon as high
              voltage and ground electrodes in pulsed corona reactors.  The major advantage
              of using reticulated vitreous carbon electrodes for this application is that it
              allows for the gas to flow through the electrode region where the plasma has
              the highest intensity, thereby facilitating good contact between the waste
              components in the gas and the plasma region.  In addition, preliminary work has
              indicated possible interactions between nitrogen dioxide and the surface of the
              electrodes.  This project is to explore the possibility of improving the
              reactor operation for nitrogen oxide removal through the coating of the
              reticulated carbon electrodes with platinum and other materials in order to
              promote reductive reactions.
