Digital Government: 
              Information Technology Accommodation Research:  Open a Door to Universal
              Access

This proposal describes a collaborative research project involving: 
              Stanford University, Social Security Administration, Census Bureau, and General
              Services Administration (GSA).  The goal of this research is to enable the
              partner agencies to better accommodate blind and visually impaired computer
              users, and to permit development of newer, smaller accessor systems for use
              with the Total Access System, a technology under development at Stanford. The
              long-term goal of this project is to create enabling technology that supports
              disabled members of the workforce at the Census Bureau and other Federal
              agencies and to transfer these technologies to the private sector.

The
              research will be conducted over a three-year period.  Year one will focus on
              the research to select and evaluate appropriate technologies and develop a
              prototype access system for the blind and to document its usability. During
              year two, the prototype will be improved based on usability test results and
              the Total Access System technology will be upgraded.  Key technologies
              necessary for development (multi-modal input and miniaturization) will be
              developed and prototyped.  The third year will bring these technologies
              together in a kiosk prototype.
