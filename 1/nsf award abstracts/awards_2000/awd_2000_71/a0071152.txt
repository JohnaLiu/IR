This project will address the need for standardized sample
              preparation of rock specimens for study by transmission electron microscopy
              (TEM); presently there is no universal method of sample preparation. 
              Ultramicrotomy (UM) is widely used for sectioning biological materials and a
              similar procedure may be applied to geological thin sections.  There are
              several advantages in being able to thin section petrographic slides.  Two of
              these concern preservation of overall particle structure and uniformity of
              specimen thickness.  The former makes it possible to examine textural
              properties of grain boundaries and interfaces with minimal disturbance to their
              microstructures and petrography.  Using methods of UM it is possible to section
              a single 10-mm particle into 200 slices with almost complete preservation of
              internal microstructure in three dimensions.  This project will result in the
              development of ultramictomy methods capable of producing ultrathin sections
              from petrographic slides.  This will broaden the use the use of TEM in
              petrologic studies.
