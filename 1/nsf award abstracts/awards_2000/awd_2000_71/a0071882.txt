Abstract    :
              This US-Argentina proposal requests support for Dr. Peter Sternberg of Indiana
              University on Bloomington to collaborate with Drs. Manuel Del Pino and Patricio
              Felmer at the University of Chile in Santiago on the onset of superconductivity
              in large magnetic fields.

This project is a continuation of an investigation
              of the nucleation of superconductivity in the presence of large applied
              magnetic fields.  The Principal Investigators will use the Ginzburg-Landau
              energy as a model to focus on their goal of describing the behavior of the
              (non-zero) order parameter whose emergence signals the loss of stability of the
              so-called "normal state" once the temperature decreases beyond a critical
              value.  They seek precise information about the critical temperature/magnetic
              field curve in order to provide a theory to support the many experimental
              efforts underway in recent years to capture this relationship.  The project
              will describe states possessing vortex lattice structure (unbounded samples)
              and states localized about high-curvature sections of the sample boundary
              (bounded samples).
