Abstract    :
              This research project, carried out in the laboratory of Professor Robert Hamers
              at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is concerned with the organic
              functionalization of group IV semiconductor surfaces, specifically the (001)
              surfaces of Si, Ge, and diamond.  With the support of the Analytical and
              Surface Chemistry Program, Hamers and his coworkers are investigating the
              reaction of various organic molecules with the double bonded dimer species
              present on the (001) surfaces of these semiconductors.  This is a route to the
              modification of these surfaces with organic overlayers, and the use of this
              chemistry for the subsequent functionalization of these materials. 
              Applications of this chemistry to the construction of molecular electronic
              devices, and the developing "gene chip" technologies are clear.

The ability
              to attach organic molecules to semiconductor substrates in a controlled and
              reproducible fashion is the focus of this research program.  If a reliable
              route to the attachment of organic molecules to these surfaces can be
              developed, the synthetic power and diversity of organic chemistry becomes
              available for the functionalization of these materials for applications in
              electronic device fabrication and in bioanalytical chemistry.  A range of
              scanning probe methods coupled with ultra high vacuum spectroscopic probes is
              used to characterize and understand this interfacial chemistry.
