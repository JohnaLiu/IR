Abstract    :
              An international conference on functionally-graded materials (FGM) will be held
              September 10-14, 2000 in Estes Park, Colorado.  This conference will bring
              together scientists and engineers on a commonality of themes related to spatial
              variations of material properties.  With a continuing emphasis on mechanics,
              the FGM concept has been extended into nearly all applications of materials as
              well as into other types of materials, such as polymers and bio-materials.
              Holding this meeting in the United States affords an opportunity for many
              domestic researchers to become more familiar with this highly interdisciplinary
              topic in North America.  Approximately 200 people will participate in this
              conference.  They will come from 22 countries around the world and be have
              industrial, national laboratory, and academic backgrounds.  Support for this
              conference will be used to enable students of participating faculty to attend
              the meeting.

Functionally gradient materials are of increasing importance
              since today's devices and those of the future will increasingly use materials
              integrated with another material.  This conference will expand the boundaries
              of the knowledge on FGMs.
