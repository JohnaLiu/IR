This project is concerned
              with the study of  the localization process and
its dual, the  colocalization
              process, in homotopy theory. One of the 
goals is to develop tools to analyze 
              the colocalization functors analogous     
to those developed by  Bousfield
              and Kan to study  completion and
localization. Another aspect of the project
              is to find geometric applications 
and interpretations of results on 
              localization. This is related to
certain geometric relations between spaces.
              The key idea is to use a fixed
space as a basic building block and  use 
              operations like push-outs and
wedges to construct more complicated spaces (in
              a similar way as spheres
are used to build CW-complexes). For this purpose the
              P.I. has been
working on understanding an invariant called complication. It
              roughly
gives the minimal number of steps needed  to build a new space out of
              a
given one. There is a close relation between this invariant and the
              so
called Bousfield lattice, the lattice of the localization functors
              on
spaces. Understanding this relation has been one of the purposes  of
              the
P.I.'s work.

Homotopy theory can be perceived as a study of the
              localization process.
The idea is to ignore information which is of less
              interest to us.
In this way homotopy theory works as a simplifying tool. For
              example,
in order to simplify spaces, we can think about the unit interval as
              the
point. In this way we ignore all the consequences caused by the
              difference
between these two spaces. By doing so we identify for example the
              
letter A and the letter O. This gives  the standard homotopy theory.
The
              P.I.'s research has been about understanding what happens if we treat
other
              spaces  as points.
