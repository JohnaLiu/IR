The objectives of this research are (1) to develop
              theoretical and computational methods that can be used to interpret or predict
              the behavior of biological molecules or supramolecular assemblies, (2) to apply
              these methods to help explain the activity of several specific systems of
              biophysical interest, and (3) to train students who will go on to have
              productive research careers in theoretical molecular biophysics and related
              areas.  Key results of the methods development work are expected to include
              faster and more accurate methods for describing electrostatic interactions in
              computer simulations of biomolecular dynamics. Other new methods should allow
              for improved descriptions of the relative stabilities (free energies) of
              biomolecules and their complexes. 

The scientific significance of the work
              lies in the deepening of our understanding of the activity of biological
              molecules and supramolecular assemblies. There will be practical benefits of
              this work in the creation of new tools for designing new proteins, and other
              useful molecules and devices. The educational and infrastructure significance
              includes the mentoring of students and postdoctoral fellows who will move into
              faculty positions and other scientific occupations, and the free distribution
              of new software to laboratories around the world.
