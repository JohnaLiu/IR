Abstract    :
              The long-term goal of this project is to develop improved general circulation
              models (GCMs) of the global weather and climate system.  Under this award the
              principal investigators will construct and test new parameterizations for
              physical processes that can be used in atmospheric GCMs.  These are :  (1)  a
              multi-layer bulk parameterization of planetary boundary layer (PBL) processes,
              (2)  a parameterization of the thermal effects of mesoscale orographic
              variability, and (3)  a unified cloud parameterization.  The PBL
              parameterization combines the local and nonlocal effects of turbulent eddies in
              a way that incorporates the positive aspects of bulk formulation used in the
              current UCLA atmospheric GCM.  The thermal effects parameterization will be a
              new contribution in that current models do not account for this effect.  The
              unified cloud parameterization abandons the artificial separation between grid-
              and sub-grid scales, and develops a unified logical framework that can be used
              for both stratiform clouds and cumulus clouds.  The products from this effort
              will not be model-specific, although they will be tested first in the framework
              of the UCLA GCM.
