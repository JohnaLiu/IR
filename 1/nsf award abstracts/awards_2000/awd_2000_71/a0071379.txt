Abstract    :
              With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              continues its support for the work of Drs. Martin Saunders and James R. Cross
              of the Department of Chemistry at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.  
              The work builds on the seminal discovery that noble gas atoms, and small
              molecules like N2 and CO, can be trapped inside the carbon atom cages of
              fullerenes.   The trapped atoms and molecules perturb the cages, and in some
              cases provide valuable spectroscopic handles for monitoring chemical reactions
              occuring on the outside faces of the cages.   Particularly useful in this
              regard has been trapped 3He, since this isotope of helium has a nuclear spin of
              1/2 and can be readily detected by NMR.   These endohedral fullerenes are of
              the type 3He@Cn, where n=60, 70, and 84. 

Work during the next period will
              focus on using 3He nuclear magnetic resonance to follow the separation  and
              purification of the isomers of 3He@C70 and 3He@C84.   Methods for removal of
              the helium atom from the carbon cages will also be investigated, potentially
              providing a way to supply pure isomers of the C70 and C84 fullerenes for
              further chemical studies.   The PIs have initiated a large number of
              collaborative research efforts with others who are using the new compounds to
              investigate their chemistry and potential applications, which range from
              geochemistry to medicine.
