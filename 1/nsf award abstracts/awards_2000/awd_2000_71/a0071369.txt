Abstract    :
              	Dr. Gray and his colleagues will continue their investigations into the basic
              structure and dynamics of tropical cyclones, focusing on the mechanisms
              responsible for intensity change.  A particularly challenging and intriguing
              part of the work will be an exploration of the nature of the inner core of the
              hurricane and the evolution of the region known as the "eye wall".  A
              relatively new source of observations, the GPS dropwindsondes, will be examined
              and should provide far more detailed information than has been available
              previously.  Other topics to be pursued include studies of processes
              responsible for variations in the tropical cyclone's outer region, factors that
              influence the maximum potential intensity of these storms, and improving
              methods for predicting changes in hurricane structure and intensity.  In
              addition to the dropwindsondes, the reseachers will employ satellite data,
              particularly satellite-derived winds; surface, and aircraft flight level data. 
              

	Although there have been significant improvements in recent years in the
              forecasting of tropical cyclone tracks, the same is not true with respect to
              the forecasting tropical cyclone intensity.  The results of this research could
              have significant impact for improving our understanding and, ultimately,
              forecasting storm intensity.

              Mesoscale Dynamic Meteorology and Large-scale Dynamic Meteorology Programs.
