Abstract    :
              This award supported by the Division of International Programs allows Mary J.
              Roth of Lafayette College to collaborate with research staff members of the
              Norwegian Geotechnical Institute in Oslo, Norway.  The project will apply
              Roth's expertise with multi-electrode earth resistivity testing into
              investigations of slope stability, leakage in dams and tunnels, and the study
              of frozen soils in Norway and other locations in Europe.  

Earth resistivity
              testing is being rapidly incorporated into geotechnical engineering
              investigations for a wide range of projects.  The results of this research will
              be a better understanding of the uses, reliability, and limitations associated
              with earth resistivity testing as well as a better assessment of the
              applicability of this technique in new engineering applications.
