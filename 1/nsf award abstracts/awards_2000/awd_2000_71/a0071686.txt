Abstract    :
              The research program entitled "Molecule Liftoff from Surfaces" will be performed
              by Dr. Barbara Garrison of Pennsylvania State University and is supported by
              the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program.  This  computational research
              program will focus on modeling the behavior of solid organic surfaces under
              impact by fast particles or during laser ablation.  These basic calculations
              will provide a fundamental framework which will lead to a better understanding
              of analytical techniques such as Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) and
              Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI).  The
              calculations are based on experimental data provided by collaborators which is
              a significant component of this project.  The goals of the project include
              developing simulations to better understand the desorption of large organic
              molecules from surfaces, the enhanced desorption efficiency when using
              polyatomic projectiles, and the experimentally observed differences between
              UV-MALDI and IR-MALDI.

The analytical techniques of SIMS and MALDI have
              applications in biochemistry, surface chemistry, polymer chemistry and many
              others.  They are widely used techniques in the pharmaceutical industry,
              electronics industry, and chemical industry.  The fundamental research to be
              performed in this project will lead to improved interpretation of the data
              obtained and more effective use of these techniques in problem solving
              applications.
