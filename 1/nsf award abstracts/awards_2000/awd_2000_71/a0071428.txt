Abstract:
This proposal covers a wide range of topics relating
              topology, algebra, combinatorics, and probability.  Specifically, the principal
              investigator proposes to study: The poset of cosets of a finite group; Markov
              chains associated with hyperplane arrangements, Coxeter groups, and buildings,
              including a chain that is related to the Moran
model in population genetics;
              the topology at infinity of Artin groups; the spectral radius of random walks
              on certain infinite groups; and the graph of generating sets of a finite
              group.

This work reveals unexpected connections between different fields of
              mathematics, thereby illuminating both fields.  For example: (a) a random walk
              on an abstract combinatorial object sheds light on a model in population
              genetics; (b) geometry and algebra have led to new results about Markov chains,
              which are used for simulations in many areas of science and applied
              mathematics; and (c) a probabilistic question about groups, which are algebraic
              objects used in the study of symmetry, leads to a new topological tool for
              investigating these groups.
