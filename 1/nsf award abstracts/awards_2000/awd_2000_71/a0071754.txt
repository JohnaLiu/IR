Abstract    :
              This project requests funds for a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER).
              In the wake of the recent conflict and vote for independence from Indonesia by
              the people of East Timor, East Timorese refugees have been relocated to various
              parts of Indonesia. This project will analyze the case of one group of refugees
              to Flores Island, assessing the impact of conflicts over land and other
              resources on resource allocation patterns and social organization. This initial
              project will generate an ethnographic base for further, long-term research. It
              specifically addresses the consequences of population displacements resulting
              from ethnic conflict and warfare, and thus has relevance to many other parts of
              the world. It also addresses issues of minority populations' interactions with
              state/military governments in the developing world. The researcher will be able
              to capture these processes as they unfold. Methods include community surveys
              and detailed interviewing with villagers, leaders, church officials, and
              government/military officials.
