Abstract    :
              The quantum-classical correspondence of non-linear dynamical systems is
              investigated using signal-processing methods.  This approach has been shown to
              be capable of extracting long-time quantum information from short-time periodic
              orbits.  The theory is applied to a number of problems of current interest.  In
              addition, a small amount of effort is devoted to looking at Pade summation
              techniques to accomplish the needed summations.
