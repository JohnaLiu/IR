Abstract    :
              Jim Weisshaar of the University of Wisconsin at Madison is supported by a grant
              from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the reactions of
              transition metal ions, atoms and ligated species  with organic alkanes and
              alkenes in the gas phase.  The studies will be carried out in flow tube and
              crossed beam apparatuses, with laser induced fluorescence, photoionization mass
              spectrometry, mass spectrometry and a special emphasis on a new technique of
              velocity mapping.  These studies will be paralleled by ab initio electronic
              structure calculations.  Information on how metal atoms and ions insert into CC
              and CH bonds will be obtained.

Reactions will be studied which involve
              organometallic species containing transition metal atoms.  These reactions have
              important applications to the catalysis reactions used to breakdown
              hydrocarbons and synthesize polymers.  The new technique of mapping the speed
              distributions of the products will be used to take "snapshots" of the products
              as they depart from the reaction.  This will enable theoretical models of the
              reactions to be evaluated.
