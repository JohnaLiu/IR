The aim of this proposal is to conduct a detailed
              investigation of 838 dwarf galaxy candidates in 34 Hickson Compact groups. The
              plan is to obtain spectroscopy (to derive metalicities), multiband imaging (to
              investigate stellar populations and ages) and HI observations (to identify
              tidal tails). These observations will be used to try and distinguish between
              dwarf galaxies which have been formed in the debris left behind when larger
              galaxies were tidally disrupted and those which were formed
              primordially.

Tidal dwarf galaxies have long been recognized as occasional
              interlopers in the debris of galaxy interactions. The proposers have recently
              conducted a census of the dwarf galaxy population in Hickson compact groups,
              and the results strongly suggest that tidal dwarf galaxy formation is quite
              common.  Depending on the survivability of the population, this process may be
              
quite significant, even as compared to primordial formation of dwarfs. The
              proposed project incorporates spectra obtained with the 8-m Hobby-Eberly
              Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope images, and Very Large array radio maps of
              the neutral Hydrogen from which the dwarfs form. With these data, we will
              compare properties of tidal dwarf galaxies to the galaxies at large in the
              groups, look for HI bridges connecting departing dwarfs to their parents, and
              assess the survivability of the dwarfs in the compact group environment.  If
              the results of this study are extrapolated to consider other environments, it
              will be possible to evaluate if tidal dwarf formation is merely one of the
              occasional curiosities of the universe, or if it is important to our overall
              understanding of galaxy formation. Funding for this project was provided by the
              NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).
