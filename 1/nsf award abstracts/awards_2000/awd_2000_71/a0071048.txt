This is a collaborative research project with Sandra Faber
              and colleagues at University of California, Santa Cruz (AST0071198).  The goal
              of this research is to conduct a large, systematic survey of galaxies with
              redshifts Z > 0.7. This survey (Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe - DEEP)
              is designed to measure both the properties of distant galaxies and their
              distribution in space. It consists of two parts: a 1-hour survey (1HS), to map
              the spatial locations of ~50,000 galaxies with Z>0.7, and a 3-hour survey
              (3HS), on a sub sample of the 1HS targets, to measure redshifts, line widths,
              and structure for ~5,000 galaxies, using HST imaging data, and going ~ 1
              magnitude deeper into the luminosity function than the 1HS. Faber, Davis, and
              collaborators will use the data to determine fundamental properties of galaxies
              at Z~1 such as: number densities, the galaxy correlation function, and
              clustering statistics as a function of galaxy type. They will also use the data
              from the 3HS to determine the dark halo masses and underlying dark matter
              distribution at this redshift, as well as the "biasing function." 

This
              collaborative project  supports a 120 night observing program on the Keck
              telescope in Hawaii that will garner spectroscopic data on approximately 60,000
              faint galaxies, with the goal of elucidating the properties of faint, distant
              galaxies, as well as the statistics of their spatial
distribution.  The DEEP
              survey will provide an unprecedented, detailed look at the universe at
              cosmologically significant lookback times.  The survey will generate
              information on high redshift galaxies and their environment that is comparable
              in quality to data currently available for nearby galaxies.  This dataset,
              which will be made Web accessible to the broader community, will
enable
              powerful tests of the evolutionary predictions of alternative cosmological
              models.  By counting the abundance of galaxies versus measured redshift, one
              can precisely determine the acceleration rate of the expansion of the Universe,
              a test of fundamental physics.  The DEEP survey will take full advantage of a
              new spectrograph being prepared for the Keck telescope, DEIMOS, which has a
              large field of view, high spectral resolution, and wide spectral
coverage. 
              The scientific program of the DEEP survey cannot be replicated efficiently on
              any other instrument or telescope worldwide. Funding for this project was
              provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC)
              and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.
