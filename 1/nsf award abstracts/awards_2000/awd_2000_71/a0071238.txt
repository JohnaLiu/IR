The goals of this project are to use redshifted [O
              III]-5007 filters to imagie and identify planetary nebulae (PNe) associated
              with the nearby galaxies: M31, NGC 720, 1399, 4406, 4472,  and 4636 and the
              intracluster stars (associated with PNe) found in nearby galaxy clusters. These
              PNe will then be studied spectroscopically (using the Hobby-Eberly Telescope at
              McDonald Observatory) to obtain their kinematics and abundances which can be
              used to study the distances, gravitational potential, and evolutionary history
              of their surroundings.

Stars like the Sun do not live forever.  Eventually,
              they expand to tremendous size, throw off their atmosphere, and die.  In the
              process, the stars become "planetary nebulae" (PN), beautiful formations of
              glowing gas that are lit up by the stars' last embers.  When viewed  at great
              distances, one cannot see the details of these nebulae.  However one can use
              the PN's distinctive emission to investigate a host of problems in astrophysics
              and cosmology.  Specifically, PN can be use to a) better define the
              extragalactic distance scale and Hubble Constant, b) study post-asymptotic
              giant branch evolution in old stellar populations,  c) probe the stellar
              motions dark matter content of elliptical galaxies,  d) measure the chemical
              composition and chemical evolution of nearby galaxies, and e) study the
              structure and evolution of galaxy clusters via their intracluster stars.  We
              are proposing to continue our successful program of using planetary nebulae to
              probe these topics.  Our immediate goals will be to measure the chemical and
              star formation history of our nearest spiral galaxy, M31, explore the mass
              distributions of the large elliptical galaxies of Virgo, and learn about the
              formation and dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters.   Our observations will
              lead directly to improved constraints on the formation and evolution of
              galaxies, and the nature of dark matter halos.
