Rapidly evolving technology places a billion
              transistors on a chip within reach of the computer architect.  Several
              approaches to utilizing the large amount of silicon resources have been put
              forth, with the single important goal of obtaining the most performance out of
              approximately one square inch of silicon.  These approaches exploit more
              parallelism in one or more instruction streams.  Examples include more
              aggressive superscalars, multiscalars, processor-coupled designs, simultaneous
              multi-threading processors, multiprocessors on a chip and VLIWs. The goal of
              this project is to discover, implement and evaluate simple architectural
              mechanisms that scale with increasing VLSI clock speed, and software techniques
              that orchestrate high-level computations on the low-level architectural
              resources for maximum efficiency.
