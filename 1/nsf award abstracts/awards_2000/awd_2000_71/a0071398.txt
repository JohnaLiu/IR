The project contains five research problems:
1. Analytic
              properties for scattering/inverse scattering
transforms.
2. Perturbation on
              NLS.
3. Perturbation for Toda lattice.
4. Random matrices.
5. Multiple
              orthogonal polynomials.
  All these problems will be studied via the
              Riemann--Hilbert
problem approach, which has shown tremendous potential
              in
solving various integrable problems in broad sense.


This project
              analyzes several mathematical problems ranging
from partial differential
              equations, random matrices, to the 
approximation theory. Some of these
              problems have pure mathematical
interest and others have applications in
              physics and engineering.
One of such applications is the soliton solutions of
              the perturbed
nonlinear Schrodinger equation. These soliton solutions are
              used
in the fiber optical transmission.
