Abstract    :
              	This research centers around some problems in the technique of model reduction
              known as stochastic averaging. Although stochastic averaging has been around
              for at least 30 years, recent developments in stochastic analysis suggest a new
              look at it. In particular, it is now clear that the reduced model can take
              values in a stratified space. This proposal outlines a number of questions,
              with the goal of a better understanding of both stochastic averaging and Markov
              processes on stratified spaces. 
	Roughly, the proposed research attempts to
              better understand the effects of small noise upon oscillations. As many
              mechanical, manufacturing, and biological systems have oscillatory behavior
              affected by small noise, the proposed research can inform our understanding and
              design of a host of systems. The more particular goal of this research is to
              find accurate methods of simplifying more complicated models. These simplified
              models could then be used in control and design procedures.
