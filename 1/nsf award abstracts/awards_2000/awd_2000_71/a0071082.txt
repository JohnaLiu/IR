Part of an international effort involving a partnership of
              researchers and indigenous organizations in Greenland, Canada, Norway, Sweden,
              Finland, Denmark, Russia, and the United States, this project seeks to
              understand the relationships between economic development and Native-state
              arrangements and their effects on living conditions among Inuit, Saami, and
              Chukotkan peoples. Results of the study are intended to provide circumpolar
              Native organizations and local governments with information to help make policy
              decisions. The key research question is how are the rapid social, political,
              economic and environmental changes occurring in the Arctic today affecting the
              people there? This portion of the international study will address this
              question as a formal pretest of the research design (questionnaire and field
              methods) in Alaska.
