Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, Inc. will operate the
              R/Vs Seward Johnson, Edwin Link, and Sea Diver during 2000 as general
              oceanographic research vessels in support of NSF-supported research projects.
              

The Seward Johnson is a 204 ft. vessel, constructed in 1984 and converted
              in 1994, and is owned and operated by Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution,
              Inc.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 269 operational days during 2000,
              of which 177 days are in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining
              cruises will support Navy, NOAA, and DOE projects.  The projects scheduled on
              the Seward Johnson represent several oceanographic disciplines, including
              physical and chemical oceanography, and will fully utilize the capabilities of
              the vessel. Operations in 2000 will mainly take place in the South Atlantic,
              subtropical North Atlantic, and the western Equatorial Atlantic Ocean.

The
              Edwin Link is a 168 ft. vessel, constructed in 1982/84, and is owned and
              operated by Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, Inc.  The vessel is
              scheduled for a total of 160 operational days during 2000, of which 53 days are
              in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining cruises will support
              Navy and other private projects.  The projects scheduled on the Edwin Link
              represent several oceanographic disciplines, including biological and chemical
              oceanography, and will fully utilize the capabilities of the vessel. The vessel
              will support several cruises which will use submersibles.  Operations in 2000
              will mainly take place in the North Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and
              off the coast of Venezuela.

The Sea Diver is a 113 ft. vessel, constructed
              in 1959 and converted in 1992, and is owned and operated by Harbor Branch
              Oceanographic Institution, Inc.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 88
              operational days during 2000, of which 26 days are in support of NSF-supported
              investigators.  The remaining cruises will support Navy projects.  The projects
              scheduled on the Sea Diver represent several oceanographic disciplines, mainly
              biological oceanography, and will fully utilize the capabilities of the vessel.
               Operations in 2000 will take place mostly in the Gulf of Mexico and
              Caribbean.

The R/Vs Seward Johnson, Edwin Link, and Sea Diver are part of a
              fleet of ships used by the National Science Foundation in support of marine
              science research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized
              equipment to be permanently installed on the vessels, thus the necessity for
              specialized ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same mode as general
              cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of
              ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by
              universities and institutions around the country.
