Abstract    :
              This project is aimed at providing Native American undergraduate chemistry and
              physics majors opportunities to carry out research on the synthesis,
              characterization, and applications of composite materials formed from
              solventless reactions of layered silicates with organic monomers and
              biomolecules.  Three specific research topics will be addressed: synthesis of
              novel layered silicate clay/polymer composite materials as the active
              components in chemical sensors; the interaction of biological molecules with
              layered silicate clay materials.  The educational goals of this project are to
              train up to five Native American chemistry or physics majors by providing
              one-on-one faculty mentoring (up through graduation) on research experiences
              that include all aspects of the research process from project inception to the
              final reporting of results.

New inorganic-organic hybrid composite materials
              are increasing viewed as important technological materials because of uses that
              include coatings for chemical sensors, and for biomedical applications such as
              bone cement and optial implants.  These are excellent areas in which to train
              students because of the strong job markets due to high industrial relevance.
