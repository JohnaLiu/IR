Abstract    :
              A broad class of transport processes in matter at high densities and
              temperatures will be studied.  One of the main objectives of this research is
              to study elementary processes associated with the evolution of neutron stars. 
              The study will focus on examining how various factors affect the evolution, to
              facilitate comparison with the existing and future observational data.  The
              outcome of this study will contribute to the understanding of basic
              interactions among elementary constituents of matter under extreme conditions. 
              In addition, the properties of the nonrelativistic electron-positron plasma
              will be studied.  The understanding gained will help guide the experimental
              efforts to create the electron-positron plasma in the laboratory and interpret
              the recent experimental data.
