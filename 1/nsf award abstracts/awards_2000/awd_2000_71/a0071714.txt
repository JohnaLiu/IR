	The Conference on the Intersections of Particle and Nuclear
              Physics has served as an excellent forum for the exchange of results and ideas
              of common interest to the two fields, notably the fundamental implications of
              the strong interaction (quantum chromodynamics) and the use of strongly
              interacting systems to study other fundamental symmetries and interactions.  As
              such, this conference represents a very good opportunity for graduate students
              and junior investigators (support for whom is the sole purpose of this award)
              to gain exposure to a broad but unified set of research areas.
