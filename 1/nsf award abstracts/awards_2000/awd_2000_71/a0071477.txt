Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks support to develop a curation facility for land-based
              sediment cores at the Limnological Research Center (LRC), UofMN, in close
              collaboration with the Large Lakes Observatory (LLO) UofMN-Duluth. Unlike the
              long-established successful curation of marine cores, no curation is currently
              available for terrestrial material. This facility will serve the paleorecords
              community by providing access to consistent management including
              logging/sampling systems, data management, and archiving. The strategy for the
              proposed curation facility is long-term, keeping pace with projected expanding
              needs. Phase I calls for construction of a prefabricated cold room for 17,500
              core sections and establishment of organizational infrastructure, database, and
              protocols. As the International Continental Drilling Programme becomes a
              reality bringing increased needs for core documentation and archiving, Phase II
              will be implemented, including evaluation of the facility, response to drilling
              initiatives, and likely expansion to 100,000+ capacity. The facility will be
              operated as a cooperative agreement with NSF using an appointed External
              Advisory Group (EAG) reflecting the wide spectrum of Earth System History (ESH)
              interests.
