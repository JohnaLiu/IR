Abstract    :
              Dr. Smoot request funding for studying neutrino physics with AMANDA II detector.
               Dr. Smoot will develop tools to handle complex data sets, distribute many
              levels (raw, filtered, reconstructed, ...) of the data, monitor the
              instrumental performance (extensive studies will be carried out to evaluate the
              performance of the digital modules developed by Dr. Smoot and his LBNL
              co-workers), and provide data bases critical to the scientific analysis of
              these data.  He will also produce simulations to improve the understanding of
              the instrumental performance and capabilities.
