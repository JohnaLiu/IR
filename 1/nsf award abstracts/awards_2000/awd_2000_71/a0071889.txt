Abstract    :
              This project, funded by the Chemistry Division, supports Dr. Gary Sulikowski and
              other members of the Chemistry Department at the Texas A & M University in
              establishing and conducting a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
              site in chemistry. For the period 2000-2002, 30 undergraduate students will
              spend ten weeks each conducting summer research under the supervision of
              Chemistry faculty.  Participants will be involved in research projects along
              with graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, research staff, other
              undergraduates and their faculty mentors. Students will achieve a realistic
              understanding of the demands of independent chemical research and gain self
              confidence in pursuing such studies.
