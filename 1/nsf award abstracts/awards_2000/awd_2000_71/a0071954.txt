TITLE:  Experimental
              Partnership: Adaptive Interactive Team Video

This project will create a
              collaborative virtual environment for group work and/or group study, in which
              semantically structured videos concerned with instruction, design, or prior
              discussion of a team effort are delivered over heterogeneous Internet links to
              heterogeneous platforms in an efficient and adaptive manner.  The proposed
              system will enable: the measurement of the effectiveness of semantic
              summarization and indexing on the access and use of video resources, the
              measurement of the effectiveness of semantic summarization and indexing on the
              access and use of video resources, the measurement of the quality of service
              effects which heuristic forecasting and monitoring of team work actions will
              have on video delivery, and the measurement of the degree of success of system
              resource management algorithms for the perfecting and progressive refining of
              video segments into the caches of clients with varying capabilities from a
              server cluster subject to resource contention under varying loads. 
              Additionally, this project will provide an efficient distributed environment
              useful for collaborative and educational purpose in its own right-one that will
              be tested in the PI's own courses.
