Abstract    :
              
Continuing research in theoretical physics will examine elementary
particles
              through their long-range interactions.  Applications
include quantum
              chromodynamics, the increasingly confirmed but
still not fully-analyzed theory
              of the strong nuclear interactions, and
"solitons," objects critical to
              elementary-particle theory, string
theory, and condensed-matter physics.  The
              work is important
because of the fundamental systems studied, and productive
              because
long-range interactions give strong constraints on microscopic
              structure.
