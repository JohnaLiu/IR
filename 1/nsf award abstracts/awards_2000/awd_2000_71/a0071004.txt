Knot theory
              applications from a newly emerging area 
of dynamics, the study of dynamical
              systems of algebraic 
origin, will be developed. The set of representations
              into 
a compact group of the derived group of a link group will 
be studied
              as a dynamical system.  New results about knot 
symmetries and branched covers
              of links are expected. 
A recently discovered relationship between symbolic
              
dynamical systems and topological quantum field theory 
will be  explored.
              The research will address open questions 
in knot theory and dynamics and
              expand on previous results 
in these fields. It will continue a new program of
              research 
in knot theory that incorporates ideas from symbolic 
dynamical
              systems. 

The investigation of knots and links has attracted great
              
attention not only in the mathematical world but also 
in the larger
              scientific community. Knotting and linking 
phenomena are found in molecular
              biology and plasma physics, 
for example, while striking similarites in
              computational 
methods arise frequently in theoretical physics. The proposed
              
research will provide new understanding of knots and links 
by using
              techniques from symbolic dynamical systems, 
a mathematical branch of
              information theory. The research 
will also strengthen interaction between
              researchers in 
the fields of topology and dynamics.
