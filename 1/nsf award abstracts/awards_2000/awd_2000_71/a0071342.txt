Abstract    :
              The objectives of the proposed work are to (i) demonstrate that the techniques
              to determine and to understand the relaibility of dynamical predictions of
              ENSO, work in a representative cross section of current state of the art
              coupled ocean-atmosphere model forecast system; (ii) determine the physical
              basis for the variation in the skill amongst forecasts; (iii) investigate the
              usefulness of a collection of forecasts from different models in producing both
              a better forecast and an indication of forecast robustness; and (iv) develop a
              general theory of linear prediction in order to extend and refine the
              methodology developed to date. 

The PI proposes an investigation of the
              predictability of ENSO in a range of numerical models.  The work is important
              because it will lead to better understanding of ENSO predictability and
              physical processes involved in tropical Pacific variability. Improvement in
              understanding is likely to lead to more accurate ENSO forecasts.
