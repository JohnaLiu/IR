Abstract    :
              This project, funded by the Chemistry Division, supports Dr. Kathy Rowlen and
              other members of the Chemistry Department at the University of Colorado in
              establishing and conducting a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
              site in chemistry. For the period 2000-2002, 36 undergraduate students will
              spend ten weeks each conducting summer research under the supervision of
              Chemistry faculty.  The theme of the project is interfacial chemistry examples
              of which include atmospheric aerosols and self assembly of molecules on solid
              surfaces. Participating students will interact with faculty, post-doctoral
              associates, graduate students and other undergraduates in weekly meetings  in
              which research progress is discussed as well as in the laboratory.
