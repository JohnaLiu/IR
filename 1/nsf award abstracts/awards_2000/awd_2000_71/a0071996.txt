Abstract    :
              This award will support a U.S.-Brazil collaboration between Dr. Franz-Josef Ulm
              of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Professor Nelson Ebecken of 
              the School of Graduate Studies (COPPE) at the Federal University of Rio de
              Janeiro (UFRJ) in Brazil.  These researchers will develop a simulation platform
              for high performance computing for the prediction of the durability performance
              of concrete dams.  The simulation-based prediction, repair, and retrofitting of
              gravity dams with regard to the deleterious effects of expansive reactions such
              as the alkali-silica reaction is another focus of the research.  Computation
              modeling will be performed at MIT, while experiments will be conducted in
              Brazil.

This research will make it possible to predict and limit the risk of
              early-age concrete cracking during dam construction, induced by the exothermal
              nature of the hydration reaction.  The application to gravity dams is expected
              to have a lasting impact on sound planning for the repair and retrofitting of
              critical infrastructure.
