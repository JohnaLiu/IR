This proposal requests
              funds to support the participation of young investigators (primarily graduate
              students) in the 5th Symposium of Supercritical Fluids to be held in Atlanta on
              April 8-12, 2000.  The Symposium has a unique focus:  the importance of
              supercritical fluids in meeting the challenges of sustainable development.  No
              previous meeting of this kind has been devoted exclusively to this important
              field.  In addition, the meeting will cut across many areas, and will bring
              together people from the separations, thermodynamics, analytical chemistry,
              environmental sciences, and process engineering communities.  Past Symposia
              were held in:  Nice (France) in 1988, Boston (USA) in 1991, Strasbourg 
              (Germany) in 1994, and Sendai (Japan) in 1997.  The Symposium will therefore
              return to the USA after nine years.  As mentioned above, the 2000 meeting, in
              keeping with the advent of the new millennium, will differ from previous
              meetings and will focus on challenges associated with sustainability and the
              environment.  It will also have a greater interdisciplinary focus, brining
              together engineers and scientists with diverse backgrounds but complementary
              interests.  Yet another innovation will be the inclusion of scientists working
              in analytical applications of the technology.
