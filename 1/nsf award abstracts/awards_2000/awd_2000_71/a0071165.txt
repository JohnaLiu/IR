The formation and evolution of blue straggler stars in
              glob-ular clusters will be modeled by using hydrodynamic simulations to
              determine the remnants of stellar mergers.  These models of remnants will then
              be used to initiate stellar evolution calculations.  By combining the
              theoretical evolutionary tracks with dynamical models of globular clusters, it
              will be possible to predict the observable characteristics of blue stragglers,
              including their numbers, luminosities, colors, and radial distribution in the
              globular cluster.  These hydrodynamic simulations will be the first to use
              realistic models for the main sequence parent stars in single-single star
              collisions, single-binary collisions, binary-binary collisions, and binary
              coa-lescences.  Based on these results, a set of simple algorithms will be
              developed that can be used to generate the structure of merger remnants without
              actually running large-scale hydrodynamic simulations.  These subsequent
              stellar evolution cal-culations will be the first to treat rotating merger
              remnants and the first to examine chemical mixing in blue stragglers due to
              meridional circulation.  Detailed comparisons with observations will be made
              and the results of the comparisons will place interesting limits on cluster
              mass functions and binary fractions.  In this way, the results of the research
              will enable one to probe the nature of stellar populations in the dense
              environments of globular clusters.
