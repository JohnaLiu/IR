	The principal investigator studies stochastic models for
              evolving biological populations in which individuals interact with each other
              and their environment.  He investigates coalescing tree processes that arise in
              both physical and chemical models of polymerisation, coagulation, and
              condensation, and in the study of stepping-stone models in population genetics.
               He suggests a new approach using the theory of symmetric Markov processes to
              the study of large random matrices that appear in particle physics and certain
              conjectures in number theory.  He proposes a family of models originating in
              stochastic differential geometry for the evolution of genetic types in
              biological populations.
	The various strands of the principal investigator's
              work lead to a greater understanding of: the dynamics of evolving genetic
              profiles in large populations, general physical processes in which units clump
              together over time to form larger units, and a class of models in particle
              physics that have not only successfully explained a wide array of experimental
              results but also have deep connections with a number of other seemingly
              unrelated areas of mathematics.
