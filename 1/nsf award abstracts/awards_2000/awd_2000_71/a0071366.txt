This proposal requests partial support for the 1999 Technical
              Activities Program of the Federal Facilities Council (FFC).  The program
              supports:

completing two information studies:  Performance Measures for
              Facilities Management-Related Activities; and, Integrating Sustainable Design,
              Life-Cycle Costing, and Value Engineering into Facilities
              Acquisition;

redesigning and substantially upgrading the FFC Internet home
              page to significantly enhance the FFC's networking and information-sharing
              capabilities; allow sponsoring agencies' field offices to participate more
              fully in FFC activities and networking; and to expand outreach efforts to other
              public and private sector organizations involved with facilities design,
              operations, and management;

convening a Government/Industry Forum on Best
              Practices in Design Review Processes; a workshop on Building Commissioning: 
              Developing Electronic Operation and Maintenance Manuals for Computerized
              Maintenance Management Systems; a workshop  series on The Changing Nature of
              the Workplace:  Planning for Office and Administrative Facilities in the 21st
              Century, and a workshop on facilities condition assessment
              practices.

publishing and distributing six technical reports containing the
              findings of the information studies and summarizing the proceedings of the
              forums and workshops; and

providing administrative support and technical
              expertise for approximately 45 standing committee meetings of the member
              organizations.
