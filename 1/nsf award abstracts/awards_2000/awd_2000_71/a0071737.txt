Abstract    :
              This project involves studies of the mechanisms of carbon nanotube formation
              using selected precursors.  Two approaches will be taken: the solid-state
              synthesis and the vapor phase processing.  In both cases the project will
              involve the study and the identification of parameters that are important to
              the synthesis of high quality nanotube formation.  From these investigations,
              new ways to produce large quantities of carbon nanotubes will be developed.  In
              the area of application, design and construction of a proto-type triode flat
              panel display will take place.  In addition, copper composites using nanotubes
              will be formed and their properties studied.  Education will be emphasized as a
              research program.  Graduate students, postdocs, undergraduates college
              teachers, and high school teachers will participate in this
              project.

Carbon nanotubes offer significant advantages to various
              potential applications areas due to their superior mechanical, electronic, and
              chemical properties.  This research area is viewed as excellent for the
              integration of education goals with research goals that focus on one of the
              most interesting new materials being investigated by the materials research
              community.
