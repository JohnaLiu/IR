Abstract    :
              This research focuses on two theoretical aspects of electron-molecule
              collisions; dissociative attachment in small linear and non-linear molecules
              and vibrational excitation of the hydrogen molecule.  The former problem will
              be treated using density functional methods.  The latter problem has been
              undertaken to resolve a long-standing controversy between the experimentalists
              performing swarm measurements and those using molecular beams.
