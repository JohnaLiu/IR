The proposed research will use sophisticated N-body
              simulations to study the galaxy--supermassive black hole connection in galactic
              dynamics. The HST-STIS spectrograph  can be used to measure velocity
              dispersions and velocity gradients in galaxy nuclei which can be used to test
              the predictions resulting from these simulations.

Virtually all galaxies
              appear to contain supermassive black holes at their very centers, which are
              almost certainly relics of the quasar era when the black holes accreted gas and
              generated enormous luminosities. These black holes are now nearly quiescent and
              comprise on average only ~0.3% of the mass of their host galaxies. There is a
              growing body of work suggesting that the gravitational influence of the relic
              black holes can extend far beyond the center of a galaxy. Moreover, the
              formation and growth of black holes may be intimately connected with the
              evolution of galaxies on larger scales. For instance, mergers between galaxies
              containing nuclear black holes would produce supermassive black-hole binaries
              which would eventually coalesce while emitting gravitational radiation. The
              proposed research would address these questions by studying the link between
              black holes and their host galaxies. A major component of the work would be a
              study of supermassive black hole binaries. The formation and decay of these
              binaries may be relevant to a wide range of phenomena.  Another goal is to
              understand how black holes affect the dynamical state of their host galaxies by
              influencing the motions of individual stars. The work would be heavily
              computational, relying on state-of-the-art N-body codes and massively parallel
              supercomputers.
