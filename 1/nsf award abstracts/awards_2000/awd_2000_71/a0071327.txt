Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will conduct research with the Laser Interferometer
              Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).  The effort will be based at Carlton
              College, an undergraduate institution.  The LIGO construction is nearly
              complete and the facility is being commissioned for operations.  A first
              science run is scheduled for 2002.  The focus of this research will be the
              analysis of data from LIGO.

The project involves a new strategy for the
              statistical analysis of data recorded by LIGO.  Over the last decade there has
              been a revolution in the computational methods for treating  Bayesian
              statistics.  Without these new methods the multidimensional integrals over the
              parameter space make a Bayesian analysis computationally prohibitive. With the 
              new technique known as Markov Chain Monte Carlo the integrals are evaluated by
              a controlled random walk through the parameter space.  This research will apply
              the techniques of Markov Chain Monte Carlo to LIGO data in an attempt to
              identify the signature of gravitational radiation and to estimate the
              parameters of the astrophysical source of the gravitational radiation.
