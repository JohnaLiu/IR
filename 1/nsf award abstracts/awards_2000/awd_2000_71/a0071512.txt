Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical physics will cover a broad spectrum of topics focussed
              on string and M theory, and on cosmology.  String and M theory are our best
              candidates for a theory that can unify all the basic forces of nature,
              including gravity.  Efforts will be made to make progress towards a fundamental
              formulation of string and M theory, and to sharpen our ability to calculate in
              these theories, so as to ultimately be able to make contact with experimental
              data.  In cosmology, research will include attempts to understand the
              "cosmological constant," whose apparent presence in nature is resulting in the
              acceleration of the expansion of the universe.  The presence and nature of the
              cosmological constant is one of the outstanding puzzles in cosmology.
