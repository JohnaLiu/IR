Moore
	The purpose of this grant is to explore the interface
              between
physics and computer science.  Recently there has been an increased
              amount of interaction between these two fields, in which methods and metaphors
              from one field are being successfully applied to the other.  These include
              quantum computation (the idea that quantum mechanics can help us compute in new
              ways), and "phase transitions" in search problems from computer science (a
              sharp jump from solvability to unsolvability, not unlike the physical jump from
              water to ice).
	Specifically, Prof. Moore will use this grant to study
              parallel
quantum algorithms, where many operations are carried out at once,
              and phase transitions in optimization problems, where we are trying to find
              solutions to a problem that satisfy many constraints at a minimum cost.  He
              will also continue to study how much computational effort is needed to solve
              problems in statistical physics, or to predict the outcome of a simulation.
