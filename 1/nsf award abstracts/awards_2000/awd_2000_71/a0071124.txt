     This project uses
              extensive Census data to study variations in crimes against school children
              throughout the day.  The area of study will be a large county (about 750,000
              residents) in Maryland.  Crime victimization rates come from all incidents of
              person crimes reported to the police from 1992 through June 1999.

     The
              overall goal of the research is to assess hypotheses derived from an
              established perspective in criminology, called "routine activity."  According
              to this view, crime rates are importantly influenced by opportunities,
              surveillance, and the mix of actors in a setting.  To date, studies to assess
              this perspective have been hampered by inadequate data bases; the number of
              people who are potential crime victims has not been known, so it is difficult
              to assess crime rates.  Using children enrolled in schools and focusing on
              crimes that take place at the school should solve that problem, leading to
              cleaner tests of the hypotheses than have previously been conducted.

    
              The main benefit of this research will be to produce a good test of this
              perspective in the sociology of deviance.  This view is considerably more
              structural than individualistic perspectives, which focus, for instance, on
              characteristics of perpetrators rather than on properties of social
              situations.
