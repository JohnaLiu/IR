Abstract    :
              The Andean Cordillera extends the length of western South America, and the
              combination of high elevations and latitudinal range give rise to several types
              of specialized alpine environments.  Jalco formations are essentially confiend
              to habitats between 3000 and 4500 meters and are usually considered
              intermediate in moisture regimes.  This proposal seeks funding to conduct a
              three-year specimen-based floristic inventory for the jalca formations of
              northern Peru.  Collecting will consist of appropriate vouchers of vascular
              plants, ferns and fern allies, bryophytes, lichens and fungi.  The project will
              yield a robust specimen database documenting the biodiversity of the jalca
              formations in northern Peru, and produce an annotated checklist detailing the
              flora of the formations.  Collaroborators include Peruvian researchers and
              students; vouchers will be distributed in the host country and other
              institutions.
