This
              proposal is predominantly concerned with qualitative aspects
of the theory of
              surfaces as well as its application to the
construction of a complete theory
              of equilibria for the general
elastic membrane.  The work on surface theory is
              uncovering
previously unsuspected qualitative behavior of the
              principal
foliations near an isolated singularity (umbilic) in a
              smooth
surface in space, which strikingly distinguishes them from
general
              foliations. This behavior explains the Caratheodory
conjecture and, in many
              cases, proves the conjecture as a mere
numerical consequence. The work on
              elastic membranes establishes
the equilibrium equation of the most general
              stretched elastic
membrane in equilibrium under an applied force field ---
              a
far-reaching generalization of the classical Young-Laplace
equation which
              was only valid for isotropic membranes. The
context for this work is the unit
              circle bundle of the membrane
surface equipped with the canonical lift (Sasaki
              metric) of the
induced metric on the membrane surface; the key idea is
              the
construction of a vector-valued 1-form on this bundle which
completely
              encodes the responding forces of surface tension set
up within the
              membrane.

Surfaces are mathematical entities which are fundamental to
              the
understanding of the structure of matter in physics, chemistry
and
              biology. The surface at the interface of two different types
of matter is
              frequently modeled by an elastic membrane. An
observer of an elastic membrane
              in equilibrium can see the shape
of the membrane, understand the forces that
              are being applied and
even measure the average surface tension but has no idea
              of the
responding forces of surface tension set up within the
membrane. This
              work reveals the precise relationship between
these observables and the
              internal surface tension forces for the
general membrane.  It follows that the
              response is never entirely
predictable from the observables (membrane
              geometry, applied
force, average surface tension) but that a certain core
              behavior
is determined --- except for a very remarkable family of
membranes
              (whose exceptional nature is defined solely by their
geometry and not their
              physics) which live by a different set of
rules. By example, it is shown that
              the common ad hoc assumptions
of isotropy are seriously flawed. The authors'
              work on the
principal foliations of surfaces has already provided a
              key
result which has been applied by Rozoy to settle a long-standing
problem
              on the symmetry of a liquid ball in general relativity,
as well as relating
              streamlines of a plane fluid flow to surface
theory.
