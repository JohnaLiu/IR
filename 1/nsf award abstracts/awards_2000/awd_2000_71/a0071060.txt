              Abstract

The planned research lies at the junction of three areas, modular
              representations of finite groups, finite projective geometry and the theory of
              designs and their codes.  Under this project, Sin will continue to develop a
              general framework in which techniques of representation theory and group
              cohomology can be applied to attack combinatorial problems about codes and
              geometries, at the same time studying how the latter areas may provide a more
              geometric viewpoint in representation theory.  The successful outcome of this
              research should lead to further new methods and results in all three theories
              and speed the circulation of ideas among them.
