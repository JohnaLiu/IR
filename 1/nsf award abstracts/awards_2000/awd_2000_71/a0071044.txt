Abstract    :
              The main areas of research will be in general-relativistic astrophysics and
              cosmology.  In the former area, the nonlinear evolution of the unstable r-modes
              of rotating neutron starts will be investigated.  In addition,
              general-relativistic models of binary neutron stars and of
              neutron-star-black-hole pairs will be constructed, as part of an iterative
              procedure to obtain accurate initial data for binary inspiral.  In the area of
              cosmology a new model will be investigated, in which nonperturbative vacuum
              energy of a quantized field causes an acceleration of the recent expansion of
              the universe.

In relativistic astrophysics, recent surprises have
              dramatically improved the likelihood that the spin of rapidly rotating, newly
              formed neutron stars is limited by an instability driven by gravitational waves
              - and that the emitted waves may be detectable.  Developing an accurate
              numerical solution for binary coalescence is crucial to maximize events that
              gravitational-wave detectors (LIGO and LISA, in particular) will see and to
              extract from observed events the physics of the coalescing objects. In
              cosmology, the most exciting and least understood recent observational
              discovery is that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, not slowing
              down.
