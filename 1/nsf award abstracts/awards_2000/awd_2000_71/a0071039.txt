Abstract    :
              	A Workshop on the Interface of Probability and Number Theory will be held at
              the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on May 19-20, 2000. The workshop
              will provide a unique and unprecedented opportunity for researchers from the
              number theory and the probability communities to meet and exchange ideas. This
              workshop is expected to stimulate collaboration between number theorists and
              probabilists and foster research in areas of common interest. Topics to be
              covered in this workshop include probabilistic number theory, uniform
              distribution and discrepancy, probabilistic models in prime number theory,
              probabilistic methods in additive number theory, and probability theory on
              random combinatorial structures.
