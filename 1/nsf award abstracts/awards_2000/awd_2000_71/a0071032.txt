Abstract    :
              This US-Argentina award funded by the Division of International Programs and the
              Division of Chemistry provides support for Dr. Julio C. Facelli of the
              University of Utah to work with Dr. Marta Ferraro at the Universidad de Buenos
              Aires in Argentina.  They will focus on modeling 13C and 15N chemical shifts in
              periodic systems, such as crystals, with particular emphasis on including
              intermolecular effects.  This project will accelerate an ongoing collaboration
              between the two research groups in developing computational tools to model the
              intermolecular effects observed on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical
              shieldings in crystalline systems.
The Utah group has expertise in measuring,
              analyzing and calculating NMR chemical shifts tensors.  The group in Argentina
              has substantial theoretical and programming expertise in calculating chemical
              shifts.  Combined resources between the two groups will speed up the process of
              developing the necessary software to take full advantage of the vast solid
              state NMR data that are available.  The results are applicable to a wide range
              of organic, biological macromolecular and inorganic materials, such as polymers
              and pharmaceutical chemicals.
