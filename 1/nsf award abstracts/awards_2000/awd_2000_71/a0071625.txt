The
              principal investigator plans to study invariants of
Hamiltonian Lie group
              actions using methods from differential
topology, Lie theory and geometric
              invariant theory.  Expected
applications include: extensions and stronger
              versions of
classical inequalities in matrix analysis, and new results
              on
moduli spaces of parabolic vector bundles.  The tools to be used
include
              methods for handling the singularities that inevitably
arise from Hamiltonian
              actions (desingularization, quantization),
which were developed in a previous
              NSF-funded project.

This project involves graduate student participation
              and
collaboration with researchers at other US and Canadian
institutions. 
              The type of question I seek to answer is: given
the singular values of two
              matrices (of the same size), what are
the possible singular values of their
              sum?  In this form the
question goes back at least to H. Weyl, who early in
              the last
century found a partial answer and from this obtained his
              famous
estimates for the eigenvalues of a Laplacian.  The question is
not
              only related to such classical spectral problems, but also to
mechanics
              (classical and quantum) and to the representation
theory of Lie groups.  Two
              ramifications of the problem which I
particularly wish to pursue are versions
              for noncompact groups
and for the infinite-dimensional groups known as
              Kac-Moody
groups.
