The
              principal investigator and his collaborators, Quo-Shin Chi
and Gary Jensen,
              will study submanifolds of Euclidean space and
the sphere within the context
              of Lie sphere geometry.  Of
particular interest are submanifolds with special
              curvature
properties.  These include isoparametric hypersurfaces, which
have
              constant principal curvatures, and Dupin hypersurfaces,
which have the
              property that each principal curvature is constant
along each of its
              corresponding curvature surfaces.  The main
problems to be studied are the
              classification of isoparametric
hypersurfaces of the sphere with four
              principal curvatures, and
the classification of locally irreducible Dupin
              hypersurfaces
with four or six principal curvatures.  This research
              is
primarily local in nature, using the method of moving frames in
Lie sphere
              geometry.

This project focuses on an important class of surfaces,
              Dupin
surfaces, which have very special curvature properties.  Examples
of
              Dupin surfaces are planes, spheres, circular cylinders and the
cyclides of
              Dupin, which have been useful in recent years in
advanced computer-aided
              design.  Dupin surfaces have higher
dimensional analogues which were first
              studied by the great
French mathematician Elie Cartan in the 1930's and which
              have
been researched extensively by many mathematicians over the past
thirty
              years.  The goal of the proposed research is to classify
these higher
              dimensional Dupin surfaces.  Another important
aspect of the proposal is the
              principal investigator's mentoring
work with undergraduate students.  Over the
              period of the grant,
three undergraduate students will be supported by the
              grant for a
summer of directed independent study in an area related to
              the
principal investigator's own research. Each of these students
will then
              write an honors thesis based on this study.  In the
past ten years, most of
              the students who have written honors
theses under the principal investigator's
              supervision have then
pursued graduate study in mathematics.  In this way,
              the
principal investigator's previous grants have played a
significant role
              in the education of some of the next generation
of scientists.
