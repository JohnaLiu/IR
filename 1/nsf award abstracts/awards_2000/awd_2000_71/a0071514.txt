              ABSTRACT:


The proposed research involves the study of higher-order Hankel
              forms,
related analytic function theory on product domains, operator
              space
structures on algebras of analytic multipliers and
              related
similarity/dilation problems.  One of the main goals in the study of
              higher-order Hankel
forms is to provide a unified framework in which to
              understand the
structure theory and, at the same time, fully exploit
the
              interface with cohomology, algebraic geometry, analytic function
theory and
              multivariable operator theory.  A main goal of the proposed operator
space
              theory is to determine necessary and sufficient conditions on a
              multiplier
algebra to be completely isomorphic to the minimal operator space
              structure in
terms of the underlying reproducing kernel and the "canonical
              model"
associated to the algebra.

The study of Hankel forms (or operators)
              arises in prediction theory,
systems theory, interpolation and control theory.
               Higher-order analogues of these forms arose in a purely mathematical
              framework, namely, group representations.  However, non-commutative analogues
              of these forms live on weighted Fock space and are closely connected to the
              model theory of theleft and right creation operators from particle physics. 
              The theory of operator algebras is the mathematical framework of quantum
              mechanics while the study of operator space structures on operator algebras is
              the "quantization" of this theory.
