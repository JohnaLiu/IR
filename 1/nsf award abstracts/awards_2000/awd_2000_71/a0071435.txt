The researcher will work on three projects.  Investigation
              will be
continued on the connection between hyperbolic dynamical systems
              and
K-theory of C*-algebras. In particular, the zeta function of a
              Smale
space will be expressed in terms of the K-theory of the stable
              algebra
and the induced homomorphisms.  This leads to a general program to
              use
the K-theory of these C*-algebras as a replacement for ordinary
homology
              groups which were used in the past to study hyperbolic
systems. The second
              direction involves the study of the relation between the
Exactness conjecture
              and the Novikov conjecture for finitely presented
groups.  If a group acts
              amenably on a compact space then both of
these conjectures hold.    The
              relation between the existence of such
an action and approximation properties
              for the reduced C*-algebra will be
studied and precise relations between the
              two conjectures will be established.
In a third direction, work will be done
              on obtaining a higher index
formula for regular Lie groupoids.  This will
              provide a formula for
the pairing of certain cyclic cocycle on the smooth
              convolution algebra of
the groupoid with the class in K-theory representing
              the analytic
index of an elliptic operator.

These projects are part of a
              general program to see how symmetry, in
its various forms, effects different
              parts of mathematics.  It is
often the case that unexpected symmetry has
              important implications.
Solutions to important equations in physics and
              engineering have
been discovered and studied by using the fact that their form
              must
be unchanged under certain transformations.  It is hoped that
              the
results of the present project will have similar applications.
