Abstract    :
              Mesoscale convective systems (MCS's) consist of a collection of thunderstorms
              that organize themselves into distinct patterns.  MCS's have been shown to be
              the source of both beneficial Spring-time rainfall and severe weather. 
              Building on previous research, the Principal Investigator will continue
              research directed towards improved understanding of mid-latitude MCSs with a
              focus on their organization, longevity, embedded mesoscale circulations
              (especially mesoscale convective vortices, MCV's)  and coupling with the
              atmospheric boundary layer.  The Principal Investigator has two
              objectives:

1. To investigate the mechanisms for organization, growth,
              maintenance and dissipation of mid-latitude MCS's.
2. To conduct a
              climatological study of  MCV's and to study how MCV's initiate convection that
              regenerates or sustains MCS's.

MCV's are mid-level, stable, weak vortices
              that appear to form from the remnants of MCS's.  They are believed to be
              important for they often appear to be the source of initiation of new
              convection many hours after the demise of the original MCS.  That is, after
              MCS's have dissipated, they appear to spawn weak MCV's which may be the trigger
              for the next day's round of MCS's.  If so, a complete understanding of these
              phenomena holds the promise of improved predictability of thunderstorms.
