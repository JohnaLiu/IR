Abstract    :
              This award by the Chemistry Division supports Dr. Donald R. Bobbitt and other
              members of the Chemistry Department at the University of Arkansas in a
              continuation of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site in
              chemistry. For the period 2000-2002, 30 undergraduate students will spend ten
              weeks each conducting summer research under the supervision of Chemistry
              faculty.  The activities of the participants are planned to promote student
              independence and to develop professional skills and judgement. Each participant
              will be given the opportunity to present her/his research at a departmental
              meeting. Participants will also visit industrial and national research
              laboratories and attend a meeting of a chemistry or biochemistry professional
              organization. The participants will be given hands-on experience with state of
              the art instrumental techniques, obtain a realistic experience of modern
              chemical research and learn what is expected of students in post graduate
              education in chemistry.
