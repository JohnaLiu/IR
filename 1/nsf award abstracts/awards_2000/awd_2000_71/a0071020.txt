Abstract    :
              Under this grant Prof. Charles Misner of the University of Maryland with the
              assistance of graduate students will develop simplified computer models of
              idealized systems of binary neutron stars emitting gravitational waves.  These
              models should allow the testing of novel methods for simplifying the
              computation of the gravitational wave signals from such exotic systems.  After
              development and testing using a simplified gravitational theory, these methods
              are intended to be introduced into large multi-institutional computational
              
efforts where the full Einstein gravitational theory is being modelled
              numerically.  

This theoretical and computational effort is being done in
              support of the NSF's gravitational wave observatory LIGO whose shakedown is
              expected to end, and science runs to begin, in 2002.  Improvements in the
              accuracy of the computational models of expected sources of gravitational
              radiation will result in improved sensitivity for the LIGO facility in
              observing the corresponding gravitational waves.  There is hope that this new
              (gravitational) eye on the cosmos will produce results as exciting as those
              given in the past by radio astronomy, X-ray astronomy, and gamma ray
              astronomy.
