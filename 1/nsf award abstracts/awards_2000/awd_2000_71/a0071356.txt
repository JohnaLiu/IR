This award to University of Miami will provide instrumentation
              for oceanographic research for use on four research vessels operated by both
              the university's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science and by the
              Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, all four operated as part of the
              University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. Specific
              instrumentation to be acquired includes an acoustic doppler current profiler
              for use from R/V Walton Smith, a new vessel operated by RSMAS beginning in
              2000, and a suite of sensors and water sampling system that will be used from
              both R/V Smith and from the three vessels operated by HBOI, R/Vs Johnson, Link
              and Sea Diver.  The shared-use instrumentation supported here will assist
              marine scientists conduct studies, particularly in  the North Atlantic Ocean
              and Caribbean Sea, during 2000 and future years.
