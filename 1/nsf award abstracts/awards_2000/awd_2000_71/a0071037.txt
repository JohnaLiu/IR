Geometric group theory and rewriting
              systems

This project involves three main areas of exploration in the field
              of geometric group theory, using both computational techniques (in particular,
              rewriting systems) and geometric methods to study groups.  The first area is
              the extension and application of geometric group theory techniques to groups,
              monoids, and algebras.  The second topic is a study of polyfree groups,
              including algorithmic problems for these groups and connections to braid groups
              and Artin groups.  The third area is a study of well-founded and admissible
              orderings, including constructions of rewriting systems which have applications
              to noncommutative Groebner bases.

Groups are a useful mathematical tool
              which originated in the study of symmetry, including symmetries of naturally
              occurring objects such as crystals and molecules.  For example, the reflections
              and rotations of the plane that map a square back to itself form a group.  This
              project is in a field which is at the interface between group theory, geometry,
              and computer science.  The principal investigator's work focuses on the
              interplay between these areas, and in particular on the pursuit of
              computationally effective and efficient algorithms for working with groups that
              are associated with certain geometric structures.  This project also includes
              applications of these techniques to other areas of algebra.
