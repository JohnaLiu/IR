Abstract    :
              This is an award proposed by Dr. Peter Chen, Louisiana State University.  Dr.
              Chen requests funds for 5 to 7 U. S. Scientists to travel to Paris to
              participate in a workshop on the Internet, Conceptual Modeling, and Operating
              Systems on Nov. 17-18, 1999. The focus of the workshop is on the development of
              a conceptual framework for web-based Operating System software development. 
              For example, one of the issues of interest to the workshop participants is the
              design methodology useful to those working in the operating systems, software
              engineering, and data engineering areas.   The workshop has other invited
              participants from Europe, Asia, Brazil and other countries.
