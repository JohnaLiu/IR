The goals of this research are to simulate the history of
              cosmic structure formation from the first generation to the highest redshifts
              where galaxies and the intergalactic medium are observed. This will be done
              using hydrodynamic simulations (developed by the CO-I) to improve semi-analytic
              models (developed by the PI). The work requires very powerful computational
              facilities which are available to the PI.

Following the Big Bang, the
              universe started its expansion from a nearly smooth initial state. As the
              universe aged, small variations in the density of matter grew due to the effect
              of gravity. Eventually, regions denser than average collapsed and formed bound
              objects. This project will develop computer models with which to study the
              nature of the first generation of stars and galaxies that formed as a result of
              this process. These computer models will be tested over the coming decade with
              the next generation of telescopes, both from the ground and from space.
