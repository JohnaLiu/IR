>Project Abstract for NSF Proposal Number 0071412 (Schatz and
              Wahlbin).
>
>Our work deals with the fundamental behavior of the finite
              element
>method. We propose to study the the general question of a
              posteriori
>error estimation. Here we aim to develop a sharp theory which
              will
>predict with precision the error on a single element.
              Fundamental
>technical tools have to be created for this. The work will first
              be
>done in the context of second order elliptic problems. We will
              also
>consider extensions to time-dependent problems involving a second
              order
>elliptic operator, such as parabolic, hyperbolic and
              partial
>integro-differential equations.
>
>The mathematical field called
              Numerical Analysis is at the heart of
>high-performance computing (which then
              applies to almost all scientific
>and technological endeavours). Our work has,
              basically, two
>interrelated aims: i) we try to gain a detailed and
              fundamental
>understanding of the behavior of existing high-performance
              methods. ii)
>we try to devise even better (more reliable and/or faster) new
              methods.
>The second step in this program is fundamentally dependent on
              the
>insight gained in the first step.
