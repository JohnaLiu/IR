This project addresses aspects of island biogeography
              theory in relation to ecological restoration.  The research will evaluate
              whether larger island size and/or shorter distance from seed source increase
              the rate of seed recruitment, seedling establishment, and subsequent island
              expansion of woody species in a "sea" of abandoned pasture. Artificial tree
              islands will be created by planting woody cuttings of two species (one that
              fixes nitrogen and one that does not fix nitrogen). The two species will be
              evaluated for their relative ability to serve as island "regeneration foci". 
              In addition, to evaluate the efficacy of the two artificial island treatments
              on regeneration processes, comparisons will be made to three other habitats:
              open pasture, remnant islands, and secondary forest.  This study will
              contribute a test of a theoretically based and possibly universally applicable
              model for accelerating succession in degraded pastures that have become
              widespread in tropical regions.
