Abstract    :
              This award provides infrastructure and research funding for the Center for
              Ultracold Atoms, a joint effort between the Massachusetts Institute of
              Technology and Harvard University designed to take advantage of the recent
              dramatic progress in atom optics on the one hand and in methods for creating
              coherent atoms on the other to explore opportunities for scientific advances
              and new technologies that would be difficult to implement within the context of
              individual investigators working in isolation.   The goals of the Center
              include developing coherent atom sources of unprecedented intensity, devising
              techniques for manipulating the atoms for scientific and technological
              applications, developing methods for trapping and cooling new species of atoms,
              studying surface interactions with coherent atoms, loading atoms into surface
              waveguide structures, and developing methods for new types of spectroscopy. 
              The Center will reach out to the scientific community with a substantial
              visitors program that will encourage senior and junior scientists to
              participate in the research and carry the Center's expertise elsewhere.  A
              companion educational project is also being undertaken with the Museum of
              Science in Boston and Wellesley College.  This project is jointly supported by
              the Atomic, Molecular, Optical, and Plasma Physics Program, the Condensed
              Matter Physics Program, and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the
              Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.
