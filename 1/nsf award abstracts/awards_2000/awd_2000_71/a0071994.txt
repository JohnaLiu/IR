ABSTRACT

Matrix analysis finds
              applications in many fields 
including control theory, differential equations,
              
economics, electrical engineering, graph theory, 
numerical analysis,
              operations research and 
optimization, psychology, quantum physics, and
              
statistics.  However, many researchers in these 
areas may not be able to
              use the existing results 
and proof techniques in matrix analysis to develop
              
their theory effectively because their expertise 
is not in matrix theory
              and there is a lack of 
communication between them and researchers in 
matrix
              theory. We have considerable experience in 
matrix analysis and have
              developed, adapted, or 
borrowed many techniques to study the subject. In
              
this project, they plan to develop and apply matrix
methods to different
              problems that arise from 
applications.  In addition to proving the necessary
              
results we will put them in more general and 
accessible settings, so that
              the new results and
techniques can be readily used by non-specialists. 
              

Matrix analysis is a basic tool in the physical 
and social sciences,
              applied mathematics, statistics 
and engineering. Matrices are a way of
              organizing 
and analyzing data.  Sometimes simple results in 
matrix analysis
              are all that are needed, however, 
often one needs rather subtle results. Most
              
scientists and engineers receive an only an
introduction to matrices.  We
              will develop and 
apply matrix methods to a variety of applied 
problems and
              will disseminate our results and
techniques to researchers in these applied
              areas.  
Our goal is to advance the boundaries in matrix 
analysis and equip
              applied researchers.
