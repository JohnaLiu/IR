Abstract    :
              The probabilistic method pioneered and chiefly developed by Paul Erdos has
              become one of the most powerful tools in combinatorics. Extensive research has
              been carried out in the study of random graphs and other combinatorial
              structures, often motivated by applications requiring the proof of existence of
              certain combinatorial objects. This project is oriented to this vigorously
              developing area in which probabilistic reasoning plays a crucial role in the
              proof of deterministic statements. One of the most notable examples is the
              Regularity Lemma of Szemeredi. This lemma allows one to decompose any graph
              into components whose quasi-randomness ensures the existence of certain
              substructures, as though they were random objects. Proof methods based on the
              Regularity Lemma already have numerous applications in graph theory and
              theoretical computer science. Recently, some of these techniques have been
              extended to sparse graphs (to which the original regularity lemma could not be
              applied) as well as to some set systems. The Principal Investigator plans
              systematic study of such techniques.
