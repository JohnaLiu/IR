Abstract    :
              Pandharipande will study problems in the Gromov-Witten theory of algebraic
              varieties. In the first two parts, recently developed methods in Gromov-Witten
              theory will be used to study the geometry of the moduli space of curves.  In
              particular, Hodge integrals and tautological rings will be studied.  The third
              part of the project is an investigation of the Toda equation for the potential
              of the projective line.  The fourth part is a study of degenerate and multiple
              cover calculations for threefolds and their relationship to M-theory.

In
              this project, Pandharipande will study basic questions in the geometry of
              Riemann surfaces using  new ideas from topological string theory.  The research
              undertaken will involve computations of basic integral series that play a
              central role in Gromov-Witten theory.  Also, the current perspective leads to
              many fundamental new lines of inquiry that will be pursued.  The whole subject
              lies on the boundary of several fields of mathematics and string theory.
