The goal of this research is to study the
              effects of the Virgo cluster environment on spiral and peculiar galaxies. 
              Using deep imaging, spectroscopic data, and HI observations, the investigators
              will obtain data on the kinematics and distributions of stars and gas in a
              sample of 25 galaxies. They will then generate computer simulations of models
              for intercluster material (ICM) - interstellar material stripping (ISM), ICM
              pressure-induced star formation, HI accretion, low and high speed tidal
              interactions, low velocity mergers, and high-speed collisions.
They will
              compare their data with these models to try to determine which interaction
              processes are at work in peculiar galaxies in Virgo. 

The Virgo Cluster of
              galaxies is one of the closest clusters to our own galaxy. Many of the spiral
              galaxies in the Virgo Cluster are small galaxies with less active star
              formation than is seen in our own galaxy. This reduced star formation seems to
              occur only in the outer parts of these galaxies and the investigators doing
              this research hypothesize that this truncation of starformation is the result
              of environmental effects related to the proximity of other galaxies within the
              cluster. This research will conduct several types of observations and compare
              them with computer simulations to try and identify just which environmental
              effects are important for the inhibition of star formation. Funding for this
              project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic
Astronomy &
              Cosmology (AST/EXC).
