	Theoretical investigations of hadron properties and
              interactions will be
carried out through a non-perturbative modeling of
              Quantum Chromodynamics 
(QCD), the strong interaction field theory of quarks
              and gluons.   
Specific topics to be addressed include: meson decays and meson
              interaction 
coupling constants and form factors, the mass and important decay
              modes of an
exotic meson (rho-hat(1405) that is beyond the reach of the
              constituent 
quark model, issues beyond the ladder Bethe-Salpeter
              approximation and 
relevant for the masses and flavor mixing of eta and
              eta-prime mesons 
as well as the 3P0 scalar meson nonet, CP violating decays
              of hadrons, 
and hadron properties at finite temperature and baryon density. 
              The work is 
aimed at providing a bridge between quark-gluon dynamics and
              effective hadron 
dynamics that will be necessary as experimental programs,
              such those at 
JLab and RHIC, probe nuclear interactions at a distance scale
              within the 
size of hadrons. 
	The approach being followed is fully
              covariant, incorporates absolute
quark confinement and dynamical chiral
              symmetry breaking, and implements
solutions of the quark-antiquark
              Bethe-Salpeter equation directly in 4-space.
The models of continuum QCD are
              guided by, and developed from, the
truncated Dyson-Schwinger equations for the
              dressed propagators and vertex
functions.  Phenomenology enters through the
              modeling of the infrared
form of the gluon two-point function.  In the
              ultraviolet region, care is 
taken to preserve the one-loop renormalization
              group behavior of the 
running coupling.  Parameters are fit to the low mass
              pseudoscalar meson
properties.  This produces a description of hadron
              observables in terms 
of quarks  dressed with nonperturbative gluon effects. 
              The distributed
space-time extent of the meson modes is retained.   Integral
              equation and 
eigenmode techniques are used in numerical investigations.
