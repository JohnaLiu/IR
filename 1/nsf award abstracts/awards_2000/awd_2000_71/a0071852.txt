Abstract:
During the last 100 years
              there has been tremendous interest in
understanding the topology and geometry
              of 3-dimensional manifolds.  In
part, because a 3-manifold is (roughly
              speaking) a mathematical object
modeled on our familiar 3-dimensional
              environment.  A 3-manifold has the
property that sufficiently small subsets
              can be parametrized by 3
coordinates.

The problem of characterizing the
              geometry and topology of surfaces, i.e.,
manifolds of dimension 2, was
              completely answered nearly a century ago.  It
was determined that the only
              closed orientable connected surfaces are the
sphere, torus, and the
              multi-holed tori.    Furthermore, such surfaces can
be given geometries of
              constant curvature, +1 for the sphere, 0 for the
torus, and -1 for the other
              surfaces.

Although great progress has been made during the last century,
              the
situation for dimension-3 is not nearly so well understood.  Nevertheless
              a
conjectural picture for the structure of 3-manifolds emerged almost
              25
years ago (by Thurston) and there has been much theoretical
              and
experimental evidence supporting his conjecture.   The
              hyperbolic
3-manifolds, i.e. the manifolds of constant -1 curvature, play a
              central
role in this picture.  In this proposal the PI in collaboration
              with
various other mathematicians, plan to investigate the structure
              of
hyperbolic manifolds and the structure of manifolds which are
              conjecturally
hyperbolic.  In particular they will study the structure of
              the
diffeomorphism group of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and the structure
              of
hyperbolic 3-manifolds of low volume. They will also address whether or
              not
a closed aspherical, atoroidal, 3-manifold has a Gromov negatively
              curved
fundamental group.  A positive resolution would imply that a
              3-manifold
which is conjecturally hyperbolic, has at least the coarse
              algebraic
structure of a hyperbolic 3-manifold.
