Abstract    :
              This award will support the 2-3 day assembly of students and professionals to
              celebrate the achievements of atmospheric scientist from traditionally
              underrepresented groups (primarily Hispanic Native and African Americans) in
              the atmospheric sciences during the 20th Century. This conference will be held
              at Howard University (in Washington, DC) during the week of March 19th, 2000.
              The conference has components that include: (1) a historical perspective of
              traditionally underrepresented groups in the atmospheric sciences. (2) A
              plenary session devoted to several outstanding atmospheric
              scientists/meteorologists who served as pioneers or as current role models. (3)
              Panel sessions addressing important themes. (4) A short but special afternoon
              session devoted to undergraduate and graduate students called "Free zone ". 
              (5) A poster session with contributions from students and professionals. (6) A
              career fair with vendors from industry and professional schools for graduate
              students or professionals in the field of atmospheric sciences. (7) A banquet
              with a short awards ceremony will close out the workshop. This workshop will be
              announced in EOS, BAMS, on the Howard Web site and announcements will be sent
              to the meteorology departments We expect that this workshop will produce a
              volume summarizing the important contributions of the workshop that will be
              distributed to each participant, interested administrators and mangers at
              government labs, private industry and the university setting.
