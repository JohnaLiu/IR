Abstract    :
              A workshop on the physics - cosmology interface will be held at the Aspen Center
              for Physics, Aspen, Colorado, January 30- February 6, 2000.  This workshop will
              consider physics that is far beyond what is presently understood, and try to
              identify signatures of this new physics that could be sought experimentally. 
              Thus, the workshop is very important to the long-term future of research at the
              physics - astrophysics interface.
