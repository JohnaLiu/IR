The University of Delaware will operate the R/V Cape
              Henlopen during 2000 as a general oceanographic research vessel in support of
              NSF-supported research projects.  The Cape Henlopen is a 120 ft. vessel,
              constructed in 1975, and is owned and operated by University of Delaware.  The
              vessel is scheduled for a total of 178 operational days during 2000, of which
              143.5 days are in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining
              cruises will support Navy and other private projects.  The projects scheduled
              on the Cape Henlopen represent several oceanographic disciplines, including
              biological and chemical oceanography and benthic ecology, and will fully
              utilize the capabilities of the vessel.  Cape Henlopen is a regional vessel
              that typically operates in the coastal water from Long Island to Cape Hatteras,
              as well as the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays, but occaionally sails as far north
              as the Gulf of Maine, as far south as Florida and as far offshore as Bermuda. 
              Operations in 2000 will mainly take place around the Delaware and Chesapeake
              Bays and off the New York and New Jersey coasts.  The Cape Henlopen will have a
              ship yard period in February.

The Henlopen is part of a fleet of ships used
              by the National Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most
              oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to be permanently
              installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These
              vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a
              result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated
              to oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions
              around the country.
