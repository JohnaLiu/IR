Abstract    :
              This project focuses on investigations of cooled and trapped atomic vapors
              composed of multiple atomic species.  The work will begin with laser cooled and
              trapped atomic mixtures prepared in a novel multi-species magneto-optical trap.
               Four areas are emphasized:  1) photoassociation to create a source of
              ultracold heteronuclear molecules; 2) an investigation of different trap
              designs for trapping ultracold heteronuclear molecules; 3) a measurement of
              atom-atom, atom-molecule, and molecule-molecule scattering parameters; and 4)
              an investigation of the properties of Bose-Einstein condensates of complex
              systems.  The experiments will be accompanied by theoretical
              investigations.
