The Euler-Poisson equations
              describe a plasma consisting of ions and electrons.  A universal property of
              these equations in a bounded domain is the existence of a bulk quasi-neutral
              plasma domain and a thin space charge sheath near the boundary.  This project
              studies various aspects of sheath formation:  rigorous justification of the
              quasi-neutral limit for two- and also multi-species plasmas, rigorous
              derivation of limit equations, rigorous derivation of rules for defining the
              sheath boundary, connections with kinetic theory, and development of relaxation
              schemes for solving the Euler-Poisson equations on the various scales to be
              found in sheath formation problems.

Confined plasmas form space charge
              sheaths, relatively thin zones where the ion density is greater than the
              electron density. The phenomenon is important in various technological
              applications (plasma etching, microelectronics, gaseous lasers).  This project
              is an interdisciplinary mathematical-experimental program for studying space
              charge sheaths.  The objectives of the research are to:
(1) develop new tools,
              including mathematical models, numerical methods, and analytical techniques,
              for prediction of plasma sheath formation and dynamics;
(2) perform new
              laboratory experiments to examine the formation, behavior, and
various
              properties of plasma sheaths;
(3) integrate the results of (1) and (2) to
              provide input for both the mathematical and experimental aspects of the
              research.
The research will bring to the attention of the U.S. mathematical
              community the myriad of open problems surrounding the analysis of plasma
              sheaths.
