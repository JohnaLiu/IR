Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will continue his research to investigate new
              techniques to improve the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors.  The
              thrust of the effort is to explore isolation systems with low frequency
              performance superior to those currently in use.  These developments have
              application in the NSF supported Laser Interferometer Gravitational- Wave
              Observatory.

Three areas will be pursued: the magnetic levitation of test
              masses, the suspension point interferometer, and the use of paramagnetic
              materials for test masses.  These developments may be expected to mature five
              to ten years from now and could have important applications in future versions
              of LIGO.
