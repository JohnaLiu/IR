This project seeks to develop combinatorial methods to determine
              the
manifold dimension of causal set representations of curved spacetimes. 
              The purpose of this study is to help forward the effort to construct a theory
              of discrete quantum gravity via the causal set approach.  An analysis of the
              failure of currently existing, coarse-graining invariant, methods for flat
              spacetime dimension determination will be employed to facilitate this
              work.
The ability to perform curved spacetime dimension determination on
              causal sets will provide a major step forward in the ability to identify those
              causal sets that are good candidates for a physically viable model of the
              small-scale structure of spacetime.
