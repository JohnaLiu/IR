Abstract    :
              This project will bring to  conclusion 12 years of field and
herbarium work on
              the flora of the region of Parque Nacional Amboro in the
department of Santa
              Cruz, Bolivia. The Park and surrounding areas constitute
one of the most
              species-rich national park areas in the world, with 3000
species of vascular
              plants documented at this time and a total of over 3500
expected for this
              flora. This will be the only floristic treatment for an
area of this size in
              Bolivia, the poorest-known floristically of tropical
American countries, and
              will be indispensable for making natural resource
and conservation decisions.
              This project will finish the
processing and identification of over 4000
              collections previously made by
the PI and collaborators in the area of Parque
              Nacional Amboro. Dissemination of results will include production of a book to
              be printed in Bolivia, and construction of a fully web-searchable database on
              species treatments.
