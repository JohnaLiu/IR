Abstract    :
              Dr. Wiseman will conduct research applicable to the detection of gravitational
              waves.  The research will have two distinct components:  (1) participation in
              practical software implementations of searches for signals from astrophysical
              sources (about 60%), and (2) theoretical calculations of expected
              gravitational-wave signals from highly relativistic orbiting binary star
              systems (about 40%).  The first is highly collaborative research and will
              include taking on the duties of ``Software Coordinator'' for LIGO Scientific
              collaboration (LSC), as well conducting Mock Data Challenges to test the
              software and algorithms being implemented.  The second part is largely an
              independent effort to study the nature of radiation reaction effects in  curved
              space time. This, in turn leads to better theoretical understanding of the
              astrophysical sources that produce the radiation.  Together these form a
              healthy mix of practical and theoretical research, as well as collaborative and
              independent work.

Over the past ten years Wiseman has participated in a
              broad collaboration to use post-Newtonian techniques to calculate the chirp
              waveform produced by  binary star systems (e.g. pairs of neutron stars or black
              holes).  In recent years, he has broadened his efforts to to study the problem
              of radiation in curved spacetime.  Continuation of these efforts will improve
              our quantitative understanding of the signals produced by highly relativistic
              inspiralling coalescing binaries. This, in turn, improves our ability to find
              these signal buried in detector noise.
