Preservation of Geoscience Data and Collections

With
              budget cuts and the downsizing of the U.S. oil industry and some
              federal
agencies, combined with the lack of space in private and public
              museums, the
preservation of geoscience data (e.g., cores, cuttings, maps,
              paper reports,
digital data) is becoming a critical issue for federal
              agencies, academic
researchers, museums, institutes and industry. This study,
              by the Board on Earth
Sciences and Resources at the National Research Council,
               will (1) develop a
strategy for determining what geoscience, paleontological,
              petrophysical and
engineering data to preserve; (2) examine options for
              long-term archival of
these data; (3) examine 3-5 accession and repository
              case studies as examples of
successes and failures; and (4) distinguish the
              roles of the public and private
sectors in data preservation. The overall goal
              of the study is to develop a
comprehensive strategy for managing geoscience
              data in the United States.
