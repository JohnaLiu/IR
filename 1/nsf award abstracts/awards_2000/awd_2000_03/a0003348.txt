Recent observations of waves preceding the arrival
              of seismic PKP waves (that traverse the Earth's core) suggest that scattering
              not only occurs in the D" layer at the core-mantle transition, but may occur
              over a wide depth range in the lower mantle. Determining the location and
              length scales of inhomogeneities in the mantle has important implications for
              both geodynamics and geochemistry. 

The goal of this project is to study the
              origin of scattering in the Earth's mantle by applying multiple scattering
              (radiative transfer) theory to PKP precursive waves, rather than with the
              single scattering (Born) approximation. 

In this project we aim to:
-
              Develop radiative transfer modeling for realistic variations of the background
              velocity, such as those in PREM. 
- Use this realistic formulation to explore
              the consequences of multiple scattering  for the interpretation of scattered
              waves. 
- Invert a global collection of PKP precursors for the length scales
              and depth extent of scattering using the new theoretical tools.
