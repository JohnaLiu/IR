This U.S.-Mexico award will support 15 U.S. participants to
              the "Seventh US-Mexico Workshop in Numerical Analysis," that will take place in
              Merida, Mexico, January 2001. Organizers are Dr. Richard Tapia, Rice
              University, Houston, Texas, in collaboration with Dr. Jose Luis Morales, of the
              Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico (ITAM)in Mexico City.  Participants
              will include academics, engineers and students.

The main themes of the
              workshop are nonlinear optimization, semi-definite programming, numerical
              linear algebra related to optimization, and application of optimization in
              network design, finance, and chemical engineering. This meeting follows a
              series of workshops organized during the 1980s and beginning of the 90s, which
              played an important role in the development of numerical analysis in Mexico. 
              The themes of the workshop reflect emerging research areas with important
              practical applications. A volume of proceedings will be published thus ensuring
              dissemination of the results of the workshop.
