The investigator has developed and implemented a
              spectral-element method (SEM) for the simulation of three-dimensional (3D)
              seismic wave propagation.  The method has been benchmarked against
              discrete-wavenumber/reflectivity synthetics for layercake models, and it has
              been demonstrated that the effects of free surface topography, attenuation,
              anisotropy, and fluid-solid boundaries can be accurately accommodated.  The
              method will be used to assess seismic risk in the L.A. area based upon a 3D
              basin model.  The main objective of this proposal is to extend the SEM to
              include global wave propagation.  The code has been successfully benchmarked
              against normal-mode synthetics for a 3D Earth model with a size of 1/6th of the
              mantle by volume and the isotropic, elastic structure of the Preliminary
              Reference Earth Model PREM.  A conforming mesh that enables the modeling of
              wave propagation in the entire Earth has been constructed.  To accurately model
              3D global wave propagation the effects of anisotropy, attenuation,
              self-gravitation, and a stably stratified fluid core need to be
              incorporated.
