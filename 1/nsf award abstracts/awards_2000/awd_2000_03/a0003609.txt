This proposal is for the installation, maintenance, and
              data analysis of equipment on the R/V Laurence M. Gould to measure dissolved
              carbon dioxide gas (pCO2) along with occasional total carbon dioxide (TCO2) in
              surface waters on transects of Drake Passage.  The proposed work is an
              extension of similar measurements made aboard R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer, and
              complements similar surface temperature and current data.
The Southern Ocean
              is an important component of the global carbon budget.  Low surface
              temperatures with consequently low vertical stability, ice formation, and high
              winds produce a very active environment for the exchange of gaseous carbon
              dioxide between the atmospheric and oceanic reservoirs.  The Drake Passage is
              the narrowest point through which the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and its
              associated fronts must pass, and is the most efficient location for the
              measurement of latitudinal gradients of gas exchange.  The complementary
              tempearture and current data, supplemented by satellite imagery will allow not
              only the quantitative description of the sources of pCO2 variability and the
              calculation of air-sea CO2 fluxes, but also estimates of the net production and
              carbon export by the biological community.
