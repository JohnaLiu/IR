A  workshop on quantitative and evolutionary approaches to
              environmental problem solving will be 22-24 March 2001 at the University of
              California, Santa Cruz. The interdisciplinary group of participants will
              discuss multiple needs in environmental problem solving and some potential
              numerical approaches to address these needs. The project fits nicely under the
              Division of Environmental Biology's nascent initiative on quantitative
              environmental and integrative biology (QEIB) and with the Ecological Studies
              Cluster interest in efforts to blend social and ecological sciences.  The
              workshop already has financial support from UC Santa Cruz.
