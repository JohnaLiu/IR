Abstract    :
              This project for six (6) months' duration will bring advisors and designers
              together to plan an environment of interactive touch-screen displays to draw
              high-school students and their parents into thoughtful consideration of careers
              in science, mathematics, and technology. Housed at Kennedy Space Center's
              Visitor Center and in keeping with the theme of space exploration, the visitor
              will become a crewmember on a future voyage and solve problems encountered on
              the journey via computer simulations.

Veteran astronauts will narrate the
              scenarios, since they have actually encountered unexpected problems in space. 
              The proposed final exhibit will have six (6) stations, each featuring a
              different episode and levels of complexity of a common storyline.  After
              solving the problem using math, science, technology and critical thinking
              skills, a registration mechanism will enable the student to request information
              on spedific careers and information about post-secondary schools that offer
              such training.
