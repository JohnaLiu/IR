Abstract    :
              Plants are sessile organisms that respond to changing environmental conditions,
              such as light quality.  Research on photomorphogenesis has provided insight
              into light perception and light signal transduction.  Yet, little is known
              about how light can control cell division patterns.  This research will focus
              on identifying which signaling pathways are involved.
