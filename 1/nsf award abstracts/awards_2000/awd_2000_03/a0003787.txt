This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              involves Maciej Zborowski at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and Mauricio Hoyos
              of the Ecole Superieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielle in Paris, France.
               The project addresses magnetic cell separation in general and magnetic cell
              sorting processes.  The investigators have developed a research scale, open
              gradient, quadrupole magnetic flow sorter in order to study cell behavior in a
              magnetic field, in flowing aqueous media.  They will further evaluate this
              system and its separation potential over current, batch-wise magnetic separator
              systems. The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in cell
              sorting and cell separation equipment.  This is complemented by theoretical
              expertise in fluid dynamics and separation methods (split-flow thin channel
              separation or SPLITT) developed by the French group.  The project will advance
              understanding of fluid dynamics that contribute to cell separation and sorting
              and applications in biotechnology and biomedical research.  

This award
              represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National
              Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living
              expenses for the US investigator and  graduate student.  The CNRS will support
              the visits of French researchers to the United States.
