Accretionary and subduction complexes are
              commonly difficult to reconstruct due to subsequent structural complexity and
              lack of distinctive lithologies, fossils or stratigraphic sequences. 
              Ophiolites, either of ocean floor or back-arc origins, provide unusually robust
              data that can guide structural and stratigraphic correlations and tectonic
              reconstructions in areas of controversial histories.  This collaborative
              project will examine the Ingalls ophiolite complex of the north Cascades in
              order to help discriminate between several regionally important assembly
              possibilities.  The work involves geochemical characterization, age dating and
              provenance analysis of the Ingalls complex and comparison of the results to
              other ophiolites that extend for 1000 km along the western United States
              margin.  These data will help determine whether the Ingalls complex was formed
              near its present position, was transported long distances laterally as part of
              Baja-BC, or is exotic with respect to stable North America.
