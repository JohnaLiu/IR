This project is focused on the area around a 5 km drill hole
              the Chinese are going to drill in the Sulu ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic
              terrane in east-central China.  The goal of the project is to understand the
              formation and exhumation of UHP rocks through study of ultramafic (mantle)
              rocks from a "forbidden zone" of P-T conditions (i.e., very high P, very low
              T).  Some specific questions to be addressed are:
	o	What type of crust-mantle
              interaction occurs when continents are subducted?
	o	How much of continental
              mass is recycled in this manner?
	o	Can timing of fluid-rock interactions be
              constrained?
	o	What do the UHP garnet peridotites tell us about
              "petrotectonic" processes?
             o	How were UHP peridotites emplaced
              into the crust?  How did they evolve during exhumation?  What mechanisms and
              rates of ascent are necessary to preserve their high P, 	low T
              assemblages?
	o	What roles do slab hydrous phases play in recycling of
              					volatiles into the mantle?
	o	Can we tell the difference between
              subduction/collisional 					architecture of orogens from younger events using
              deep-seismic profiles?
             o	In what tectonic settings does UHP
              metamorphism and subsequent exhumation occur?  Is continent-continent collision
              required?

The Principal Investigators  will employ a variety of methods in
              their study:  1) mapping and structural analysis; 2) petrology & geochemistry;
              3) geochronology;  4) geophysics at the Donghai drill site;  and 5)  geodynamic
              modeling.
