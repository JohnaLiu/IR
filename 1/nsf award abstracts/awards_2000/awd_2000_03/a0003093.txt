Abstract    :
              For more than 20 years, Dr. Guthrie has distinguished herself as a Chemistry
              Professor and mentor of K-12 students. Her accomplishments include the
              establishment in 1986 of the Greensboro Area Mathematics and Science Education
              Center.  The Center's pre-college component serves 450 7th through 12th grade
              students annually through a school-based academic enrichment program; a
              Saturday Academy in the sciences and mathematics for minority youth; mentored
              research experiences during summer; and, a parental involvement program. 
              Ninety-seven percent of the pre-college program graduates have matriculated to
              college and 75% percent have majored in science, mathematics or engineering. 
              Dr. Guthrie also coordinated the North Carolina State Science Fair for fourteen
              years.  She is presently a member of the faculty at North Carolina A&T State
              University.
