Abstract    :
              This award will support a post-doctoral researcher for two years to investigate
              the temporal evolution of gravity wave ducting the mesosphere and lower
              thermosphere (MLT) region using a two-dimensional model to perform numerical
              simulations.  The model will include the effects of molecular and eddy
              diffusion to simulate the wave dissipation.  Earlier studies of wave ducting in
              the lower thermosphere thermal duct show excellent results compared with the
              observations.  However, the earlier results were based on models that assumed
              the existence of monochromatic waves superimposed on a steady mean-state
              atmosphere.  This approach is oversimplified.  The new model will provide the
              temporal evolution of ducting in a time-dependent atmosphere.
