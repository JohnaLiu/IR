Abstract

The objective of the proposed research is to realize
              order-of-magnitude improvements in the interference mitigation capability of an
              antenna array with its associated multi-channel digital signal processing
              algorithms, compared with performance presently attainable using conventional
              linear processing.  The motivating commercial applications include
              high-capacity cellular telephony, personal communications systems, and wireless
              local area networks.  Such huge increases in interference mitigation capability
              translate to similar magnitude increases in system capacity.  With no end in
              sight to the accelerating demands on communications capacity, the commercial
              value of a breakthrough of this type would be tremendous.  

The signal
              processing method being investigated is joint demodulation of multiple signals
              using a multichannel Viterbi algorithm modified to trade signal quality for
              computational cost.  The goals are to 1) characterize the number of interfering
              signals that can be separated and 2) characterize the degree of reduction in
              complexity of the Virterbi algorithm that can be realized while maintaining
              acceptable bit-error-rate, both as functions of the number of antenna elements
              in the array, and parameterized by signal-to-noise ratio.  The interference
              environments simulated model cellular telephone channels with GSM and/or IS-136
              signaling.
