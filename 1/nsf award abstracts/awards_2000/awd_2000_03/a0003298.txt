Abstract    :
              This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) focuses on methodology and
              procedures to enhance the creation of engineering design alternatives.  The
              creation of design alternatives is often thought of as the creative aspect of
              engineering design, and current methods hold that creativity is best expressed
              in a value-free environment.  This research takes the opposite view and, in an
              approach called value-focused thinking, seeks to evoke creativity by focusing
              specifically on values or preferences relevant to the design.  Preferences in
              the case of engineering design are made explicit by design objectives. 
              Procedures will be developed to aid in the elicitation of a full set of design
              objectives, and methods will be developed and tested to use these objectives to
              stimulate the creation of design alternatives.

If successful, this research
              could represent a breakthrough in how creativity is viewed, taught and
              practiced in engineering design.  Creativity is extraordinarily important in
              engineering design, with the efficacy of the entire design process hanging in
              the balance.  Advances toward a theory of creativity could have enormous impact
              on all of engineering design and engineering education.
