Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to develop consistent methods for determining
              the acidity functions of solid acid catalysts.  Three components are proposed:
              evaluation of Lewis acidity by complexation of linear ethers, examination of
              Bronsted sites by adsorption of pyridine derivatives, and exploration of
              reaction mechanisms associated with conversation of saturated hydrocarbons. 
              One aspect will be the development of a quantitative scale for Lewis acidity
              using ethers as bases and nuclear magnetic resonance as the probe.  The
              dependence of acid strength on local curvature has been observed and will be
              investigated.  In addition to a calibration of acid strength from equilibrium
              measurements as higher temperatures, reactions of hydrocarbons on zeolites at
              lower temperatures, where thermal activation is less important, will be
              studied.  The reactants chosen, paraffins and cycloparaffins, are those that
              require the greatest strength of catalyst for an acid-catalyzed reaction.  This
              work will help provide a clearer, fundamental understanding of some
              newer-generation solid acids such as zirconia-supported sulfates and
              heteropolyacids.
