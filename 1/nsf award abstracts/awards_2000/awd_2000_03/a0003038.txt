Abstract    :
              Previous work by the investigator showed that transient predators (schools of
              jacks) are capable of density-dependent predation on newly-settled coral reef
              fish (Chromis cyanea).   This study will use new telemetry techniques to help
              answer fundamental questions about how predators can regulate local populations
              of marine fish, leading to a better understanding of both fish population
              dynamics and also potential impacts of fishing and other human activities. The
              investigator will capture, tag, and acoustically track up to 20 small bar jack,
              following their movement (along with their associated schools) for 5 weeks
              during August and September 2000.  The study area, in the Bahamas, will be a
              matrix of 32 natural and 16 artificial reefs, where prey density can be
              experimentally manipulated.  The goal is to determine: whether tagged jacks
              spend more time at reefs with high prey densities, as previously documented
              using remote video samples; whether jacks move randomly or systematically among
              reefs; and what the overall range of movement of the predator is.  The data
              should provide new insights on the behavioral mechanisms by which predators
              cause density-dependent mortality and lead to more detailed studes that
              separate the relative roles of aggregative vs. functional responses in
              predator-prey dynamics among marine fishes.
