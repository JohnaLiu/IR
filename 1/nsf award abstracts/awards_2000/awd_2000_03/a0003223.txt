Abstract    :
              The State University of New York College at Brockport  is requesting support to
              upgrade its current computer facilities.  The funds will be used to upgrade
              SUNY current file server and replace existing SUN LX workstations.  The present
              equipment will not satisfy the demands of the faculty or the students due
              outdated software.  With the new equipment, students and faculty can improve
              their research activities and the Earth Sciences department can improve its
              role as a Unidata archival and relay site.  Furthermore, the upgrades will
              allow a full integration of Unidata supported meteorological analysis and
              display software packages into SUNY's meteorology curriculum.
