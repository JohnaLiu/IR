This project will use the eastern syntaxis of the Himalayan
              orogen to address key questions in the geodynamics of continental collisions: 
              how do orogens and associated plateaus come to an end, how do tectonic and
              surficial processes interact to shape the crust during orogeny, and how is
              deformation partitioned at various scales?  Specific hypotheses to be tested
              are: 1) rheology controls topography and lithospheric mechanics across
              plateau/indentor margin; 2) erosion controls lithospheric dynamics to the same
              extent as crustal thickening and lateral accommodation;  feedbacks between the
              two ultimately shape the evolution of the orogen; and 3) there is complete
              decoupling between upper crustal and lower lithospheric deformation within the
              "syntaxial" region.  The approach to be used involves tracking the magnitude,
              rates, and type of mass fluxes through the central region of the eastern
              Himalayan syntaxis.  To do this, the Principal Investigators will use
              geochronologic, geomorphic, GPS, petrologic, seismic, and structural
              techniques, fully integrated by three-dimensional modeling.
