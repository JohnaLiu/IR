This proposal is focused on the study the elastic
              properties of two unquenchable mantle phases, high pressure phase of
              clinoenstatite, and calcium silicate perovskite. This project will utilize the
              DIA-type cubic anvil high pressure apparatus (SAM85) installed at beamline
              X17B1 of the NSLS at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) using synchrotron
              X-ray radiography and X-ray diffraction techniques in conjunction with high
              pressure ultrasonic interferometry. The investigators will use an X-ray
              radiography technique to record the sample image at the same time as the travel
              time through the sample is measured, providing the length of the sample needed
              for the calculation of velocity. When the formation of the unquenchable phase
              is confirmed by X-ray diffraction, simultaneous measurement of pressure,
              temperature, volume, Vp, Vs, and the length of the sample (P-V-T-Vp-Vs-L) at
              subsequent P-T conditions will provide data for both equation of state analysis
              and the determination of the pressure and temperature derivatives of the
              elastic bulk and shear moduli. Such data for clinopyroxene and calcium silicate
              perovskite phases are crucial for interpreting seismic observations to
              determine the composition and the mineralogy of the mantle.
