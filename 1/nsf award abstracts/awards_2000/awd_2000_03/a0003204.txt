Abstract    :
              The Department of Geosciences at the University of Louisiana at Monroe (ULM) is
              requesting support to replace its current server.  ULM plans to purchase a
              dual-processor Pentium III personal computer.  This computer will enable   ULM
              to resume its role as a relay site in the IDD topology, to archive data, and to
              have a reliable data ingestor for the University.  Furthermore, ULM will be
              able to expand its research opportunities having the capability to ingest
              satellite and radar data and storing data for longer periods of time.
