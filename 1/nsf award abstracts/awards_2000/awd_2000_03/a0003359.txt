A fundamental goal of geochemical research at
              mid-ocean ridge and ocean-island volcanoes is to infer the process of basaltic
              melt generation and transport.  The U-series isotope abundances of young lavas
              (e.g., 226Ra and 230Th) are particularly well suited for this purpose because
              the half-lives of 226Ra and 230Th (1600 yr and ~75 kyr, respectively) are
              thought to be similar to the time scale of magmatic processes.  This unique
              feature of U-series isotopes offers the potential to study both the nature and
              timing of magma genesis.  The goal of this project is to investigate the
              dynamics of mantle melting within the Reunion plume using the 226Ra-230Th-238U
              disequilibria of a detailed time series of historical lavas from Piton de la
              Fournaise Volcano (1931-1998).  This volcano is ideally suited for a U-series
              isotope study of mantle melting because (1) its historical lavas display
              systematic temporal fluctuations of incompatible trace element ratios that are
              thought to result from rapid changes in the degree of partial melting and (2)
              it is known to tap a homogeneous mantle source region.  Thus, we expect to be
              able to isolate the U-series isotope signatures of mantle melting at Piton de
              la Fournaise from the complicated effects of source heterogeneity, which is
              difficult at most mid-ocean ridge and ocean-island volcanoes.  We will evaluate
              a range of melting models with this data set.  These model results will be used
              to explore the basic links between the geochemical and geophysical parameters
              of mantle melting within the Reunion plume, such as the melt fraction, the
              fertility of the mantle source region, the rates of mantle melting and
              upwelling, the melt-zone porosity, and the mechanism of melt generation and
              transport.  Additionally, we will compare our new data and model results for
              Piton de la Fournaise with previous U-series isotope and other geochemical work
              from Kilauea and Mauna Loa to test the common assumption that Hawaiian
              volcanoes serve as models for other ocean-island volcanoes.
