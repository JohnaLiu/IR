The University of Wisconsin will support
              the project funded by Office of Polar Programs at NSF that require support
              taking ice-cores from, or drilling into, glaciers and ice-sheets. This involves
              maintaining the NSF's current inventory of drill systems and making them
              available to science projects, or operate them for projects. The projects are
              expected to be diverse, and to vary from year to year.  They will occur at both
              poles, and at more temperate and high altitude sites.  University of Wisconsin
              will work with the science community to define requirements, scope solutions
              before formal proposals are submitted to OPP.  Additional engineering
              development that will occur during the first year of the contract will include
              the development of a drill to rapidly making shot-holes in polar firn, and
              another system to prepare a 300 meter bore-hole in the ice sheet at the South
              Pole for a broad-band seismometer array.  A longer term activity will be to
              evaluate the current 5.2" deep drill system to recommend improvement, and make
              a development plan to implement the improvements.
