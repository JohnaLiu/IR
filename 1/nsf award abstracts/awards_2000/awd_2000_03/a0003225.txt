Abstract    :
              This project will support measurements of VOCs (volatile organic compounds) from
              plants under conditions of leaf senescence and frost damage. Compounds include
              hexenals, hexanal, pentenols, and other C5 and C6 VOCs. The field measurements
              will be carried out at the PROPOHET (Program for Research on Oxidants:
              Photochemistry, Emissions, and Transport) site in Michigan during the fall.
              Ancillary measurements will be available to determine air mass origin etc.
              These measurements will be carried out using on-line proton transfer
              reaction/mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) in collaboration with the University of
              Innsbruck, Austria, and adsorbent cartridges and GC/MS (gas chromatography/mass
              spectrometry), in collaboration with NCAR. A recently developed relaxed eddy
              accumulator (REA) cartridge sampler will be used for flux measurements. This
              work will enhance our understanding of the contribution to tropospheric
              photochemistry and air quality of organic compounds emitted from plants.
