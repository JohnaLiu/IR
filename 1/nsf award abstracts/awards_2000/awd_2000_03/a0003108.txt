Abstract    :
              Since joining the faculty at California State University, Northridge in 1988,
              
Dr. Zavala has afforded intensive research experiences to 112 undergraduate
              students, including 89 underrepresented minorities and 81 females, primarily
              from families with no history of university attendance.   Under Dr. Zavala's
              tutelage, students analyze and present journal articles, and learn to write
              applications and favorably present themselves.  Dr. Zavala accompanies them to
              national conferences where they present their research in a scientific forum,
              and meet scientists from different institutions.  Under her reassuring
              guidance, students quickly gain self-confidence as they learn what is expected
              of them as scientists and how to think like scientists.   To date, 70% of Dr.
              Zavala's mentees have begun graduate studies with 52% of them continuing in
              doctoral programs.  
Dr. Zavala also conducts pre-college science teaching
              outreach. As president-elect of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and
              Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), Dr. Zavala further extends her national
              influence.
