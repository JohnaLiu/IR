Abstract    :
              Symposium 2000 on Adaptive Systems for Signal Processing, Communications and
              Control (AS-SPCC) sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
              Engineers Canada (Region 7) is seeking a grant toward the cost of conference
              publications and to partially support graduate student participation.  The
              symposium is the first International Symposium presenting work in Fundamentals
              of Adaptive and Learning Systems, Pattern Recognition, Adaptive Signal
              Processing, Radar Signal Processing, Wireless Communications, Adaptive Control,
              Nonlinear Dynamical Systems and Computational Intelligence in Finance.  The
              Symposium is being held in Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, October 1-4, 2000. 
              The Symposium site is the Chateau Lake Louise.
