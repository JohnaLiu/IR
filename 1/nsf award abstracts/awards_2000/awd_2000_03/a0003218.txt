Abstract    :
              The investigators will deploy an all-sky imager to perform mesosphere
              temperature mapping at the Air Force's high altitude Space Surveillance
              facility on Maui.  The Air Force and the National Science Foundation are
              jointly funding a campaign to study the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere
              (MALT), referred to as Maui/MALT.  The investigators will participate in the
              Maui/MALT campaign by (1) providing unique data on gravity wave and tidal
              characteristics and their induced intensity and temperature perturbations, and
              (2) providing frequent measurements of mesospheric temperature and intensity
              variability at two heights.  Measurements will be made over a two-year period
              permitting long-term, seasonal studies of the mesosphere and lower
              thermosphere.  The long-term measurements will complement and enhance the wind
              and temperature measurements to be made by a coincident lidar instrument
              coupled to the 3.67m Advanced Electro-Optical System telescope.  These studies
              contribute to knowledge of the dynamics and energetics of the middle atmosphere
              and its sensitivity to global change.
