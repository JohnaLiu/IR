Title: Broadband Seismic
              Investigation of Crust and Upper Mantle Structure Beneath Kenya

PI: A.
              Nyblade, Penn State

In this project, we will critically evaluate models for
              the origin of rifting, volcanism and uplift in East Africa by imaging the
              seismic structure of the upper mantle beneath the Kenya rift using broadband
              seismic data.  Although East Africa has long been regarded as a classic area in
              which to study the early stages of continental breakup, the origin of the
              Cenozoic rifting, volcanism, and plateau uplift found there is still poorly
              understood.  For a variety of reasons, the rifting, volcanism, and plateau
              uplift has been commonly attributed to one or more mantle plumes.  However,
              whether a plume exists beneath East Africa is a contentious issue because
              geochemical and geophysical data from there, until recently, have provided
              little information on mantle composition and thermal structure beneath the
              lithosphere where the plume is hypothesized to lie.  To further test plume
              models for East Africa, as well as non-plume models, we will conduct a passive
              source seismic experiment in Kenya to obtain broadband seismic data.  The data
              will be analyzed using a number of proven modeling techniques for imaging crust
              and upper mantle structure.  The resulting seismic images, combined with
              geochemical and other geophysical data from East Africa, will let us identify
              thermal and/or compositional structures in the upper mantle that can, in turn,
              be used to discriminate between models of the structure and development of East
              Africa.
