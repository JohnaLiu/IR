Title: High Resolution Imaging
              of the Geometry and Seismic Properties of the Karadere-Duzce Branch of the
              North Anatolian Fault at Depth

              Southern California

This research will conduct a comprehensive high
              resolution imaging of the Karadere-Duzce branch of the North Anatolia Fault,
              using near-fault seismic data collected along and around the Karadere-Duzce
              rupture zone during the 5.5 months following the Mw7.4 August 17, 1999,
              earthquake by a RAMP PASSCAL seismic network. The study area straddles the
              structurally important eastern and western ends of the August 17 and November
              12, 1999, M 7+ ruptures. Research will include analysis, interpretation, and
              integration of information from the following categories of studies: (1)
              regional imaging using earthquake travel time tomography; (2) several possible
              seismic signatures of damaged fault zone material at depth including
              anisotropy, non-linear wave propagation, and fault zone trapped and head waves
              effects; and (3) high-resolution hypocenter locations of recorded seismicity.
              Goals of the research are: 1) providing high resolution imaging of width,
              continuity, and seismic properties of the fault zone at depth; and 2)
              establishing correlations between (a) lithology and fault offsets at the
              surface, (b) space-time patterns of large earthquake ruptures, (c)
              microseismicity patterns at depth, and (d) properties of damaged fault zone
              rock at depth as imaged by various seismic signals. Results of the research
              will contribute to a better understanding of properties and mechanics of major
              transform plate-boundary fault zones. The developed integrated methodology will
              be useful for applications to other fault systems.
