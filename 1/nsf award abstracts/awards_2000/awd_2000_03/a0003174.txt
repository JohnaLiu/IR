Abstract    :
              The investigators will study the source of variability of the equatorial
              F-region vertical plasma drift.  Two possible sources will be investigated: The
              day-to-day changes in the amplitude of the tidal modes propagating from the
              lower atmosphere, and the variability induced by fluctuating magnetospheric
              sources at high latitudes.  The first study will involve forcing the model with
              realistic hour-to-hour and day-to-day variability in the tidal modes at the
              base of the thermosphere.  This will be based on the measurements from
              incoherent scatter radar sites, from meteor wind radar, and from satellite
              observations.  The second study will involve forcing the model with realistic
              hour-to-hour and day-to-day changes in the magnetospheric sources.  The study
              will make use of a coupled global model of the thermosphere, ionosphere, and
              plasmasphere.
