This award supports a
              one year lab-based study which will allow a detailed calibration between
              ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data and existing drilled sediment sequences 
              from Lower Taylor Valley, which will improve the lithostratigraphy in the
              region.  In addition, exposure-age dating of existing samples from the Hjorth
              Hill locality in Taylor Valley will also be carried out in order to test the
              multiple drift-sheet interpretation of the GPR data.   All of the goals
              described in the revised scope of work are consistent with the goal of the
              original proposal, which was to resolve multiple WAIS glaciations and regional
              climate change.   This work is complementary to studies of the variability of
              the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) and will help to improve resolution of
              alpine and piedmont glacier variability during the latest Pleistocene.
