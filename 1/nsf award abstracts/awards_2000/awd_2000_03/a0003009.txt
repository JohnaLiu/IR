Abstract    :
              The Evaluators' Institute provides high-quality short-courses taught by
              nationally recognized experts in the evaluation field.  Courses are scheduled
              to allow participants to take 2-3 courses over the period of a week.  This SGER
              will test whether SMET professionals can be involved in these courses by
              offering $1000 Tuition scholarships.  Since the Evaluators' Institute is
              providing courses this summer and a limited set again in the fall, decisions
              about future planning by the Evaluation Program can be made in a timely manner.
