Project Abstract

This award focuses on the
              maintenance and enhancement of the Biology Workbench; an integrated set of
              tools for sequence analysis, originally created as part of the NPACI/NCSA
              project and recently relocated to UCSD. The project will add additional public
              domain tools and continue to serve a wide base of molecular biology researchers
              and educators as a single, integrated data retrieval and analysis resource.
