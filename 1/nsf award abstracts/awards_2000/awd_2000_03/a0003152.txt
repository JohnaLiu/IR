Abstract    :
              This PI received a posdoctoral fellowship in 1997 to work on how ecological
              history affects the strength of trophic cascades in lakes.  Dr. Fischer worked
              with Dr. Nelson Hairston at Cornell University for her fellowship.  She is now
              in a tenure track position at Franklin and Marshall College and proposes to
              test the hypothesis that direct and indirect effects can be distinguished using
              simultaneous PRESS and PULSE perturbation experiments.  She will do this by
              assessing the effects of the two types of manipulations on freshwater
              zooplankton communities and fish predators.  She will conduct in situ mesocosm
              experiments and overall, will assess the breakpoint where a PULSE becomes a
              PRESS for freshwater zooplankton in the north temperate zone.
