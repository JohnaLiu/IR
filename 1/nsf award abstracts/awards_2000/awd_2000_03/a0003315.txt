Tectonic overpressure is an old, fundamental but still
              controversial problem in geology.  Recent work clearly demonstrates that, in
              non-Andersonian stress regimes, the magnitude of tectonic overpressures is not
              limited by the rock strength.  Ductile high-strain zones are non-Andersonian
              stress domains. Little is known of overpressures in such important tectonic
              environments.  This investigation uses numerical and analytical modeling
              techniques to address two questions: (1) Can high overpressures be generated in
              high-strain zones, given realistic rheology and natural deformation conditions?
               (2) Can high overpressures,if generated, be dynamically maintained for
              significant geological times to affect metamorphic reactions?  Regardless of
              whether the answers are positive or negative, the research results will have
              significant scientific merit.   A negative answer to either question would
              place the now widely-practiced pressure-depth conversion on a rigorous basis. 
              A positive answer to both questions implies that the pressure data from
              
high-strain zone rocks cannot be converted to depths without qualification. 
              Current tectonic interpretation of geothermobarometric data needs to be
              reconsidered.  Since many high-pressure and ultrahigh-pressure rocks show
              evidence of a high-strain zone origin, a significant overpressure would imply
              that these rocks may have formed at depths considerably shallower than
              currently believed.  A higher-than-lithostatic pressure gradient as a result of
              overpressure buildup is a possible driving force to be considered for fluid
              flow, melt extraction and migration, and pluton emplacement.
