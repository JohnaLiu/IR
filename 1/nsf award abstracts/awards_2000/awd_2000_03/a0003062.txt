This project requests travel support for 24 participants
              from U.S. universities in the Student Paper Competition at the 2000 IEEE MTT-S
              International Microwave Symposium (IMS).  The IMS is the annual meeting of the
              Microwave Theory and Techniques Society (MTT-S) of the Institute of Electrical
              and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).  The IMS is also the major international
              symposium in the microwave field and a focus of research results in wireless
              telecommunications.  The 2000 IMS will be held in Boston, MA on June
              11-16,2000.

Each year, the Microwave Theory and Techniques Society promotes
              student education in microwave theory and techniques through the number of
              mechanisms.  One of the most important is the Student Paper Competition at the
              IMS.  This selective program brings the world's best students together in an
              integrated program in which they present their work not only to a technical
              audience but again to a group of judges.  The program helps develop the
              students' technical acumen as well as their communication and presentation
              skills.  It also helps introduce then to the international technical community
              and helps to build a community students who will lead the next generation of
              microwave engineers.

The IMS provides financial support of various forms but
              does not reimburse travel expenses.  Travel support from NSF will ensure that
              the program is open to the widest range of interested applicants from U.S.
              universities.
