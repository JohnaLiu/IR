Abstract    :
              This award establishes a coordination office for the U.S. and international
              Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics (SO-Globec) programs at Old
              Dominion University.  The office will carry out administrative functions for
              the twenty-five principal investigators that make up the U.S. SO-Globec study. 
              Specifically the office will serve as the single point of contact for the U.S.
              SO-Globec community; provide contact with the broader international Globec
              program, the International Whaling Commission, the Scientific Committee on
              Antarctic Research, the Scientific Committee for Ocean Research, and other
              international bodies; coordinate workshops and investigator meetings for the
              U.S. SO-Globec study; provide visibility through newsletters, popular articles,
              and other types of publications, and coordinate special sessions on Southern
              Ocean Globec activities at national and international meetings.
