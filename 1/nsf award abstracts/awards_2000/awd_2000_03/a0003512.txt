Two important problems obstruct understanding of the tectonics of
              central Asia.  The first is the consistent pattern of disturbingly low
              paleolatitudes derived from a large number of high-quality paleomagnetic
              studies of Tertiary rocks from sites that reach all the way from eastern China
              to Kyrgyzstan, 3,000 km to the west. The difference between these
              paleolatitudes and those expected from paleomagnetic reference poles for
              Eurasia averages 18o in western China and Kyrgystan, implying northward
              displacements relative to Siberia in the Tertiary that are much larger than
              geological estimates of shortening across intervening mountain belts. Many
              researchers in Asian tectonics have recognized this problem.  A significant
              clue to its solution may lie in the fact that none of the Eurasian reference
              poles for Tertiary time is from rocks anywhere near Siberia, suggesting that
              they may not be appropriate for calculating convergence with Siberia.  This
              question must be answered before it will be possible to evaluate how much of
              the discrepancy is tectonic, geomagnetic, and rock magnetic.  The second
              problem is the history of closure of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean.  This large
              ocean used to separate the Mongolia-North China composite block from Siberia. 
              The geologic evidence concerning this subject is interpreted in a wide variety
              of ways, resulting in controversy over the timing and geometry of closure and
              when and to which margin accretion of terranes occurred.
