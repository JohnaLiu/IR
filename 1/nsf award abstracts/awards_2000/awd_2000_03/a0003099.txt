Abstract    :
              For more than 20 years, Dr. Villarreal has directed research and mentoring
              programs that have enhanced the science careers of hundreds of women and
              minority students at the undergraduate and graduate levels.  His contributions
              include the implementation and management of an international research training
              program for minority students, now in its 6th year of operation; a laboratory
              research training program for 40 undergraduates and five graduate students per
              year; a bridge program that provides research training for community college
              students; and, a research-based course in writing that imparts communication
              and critical thinking skills to undergraduate students.  During the past eight
              years, more than 225 students have benefited from Dr. Villarreal's commitment
              to mentoring. At least 50 of these students earned or are pursuing graduate
              degrees in science.  Dr. Villarreal is presently a member of the faculty of the
              University of California, Irvine.
