Abstract    :
              The evolution of many species was facilitated by changes in feeding capacity.
              Extensive testing has shown modifications in tooth size, shape, and biting
              forces are critical determinants of feeding capacity. However, changes in the
              mechanical performance of dental tissues, which may also play an integral role
              in this process, are little understood. Data regarding material level
              mechanical capacity is lacking since dental tissues are minute and preclude
              most testing protocols. In the present research this problem will be overcome
              using a new engineering technique called nano-indentation  (miniaturized
              mechanical testing) whereby the measurement of strength, hardness, and
              scratch-resistance of small materials is feasible. The method will be applied
              to enamel (the primary contact tissue between food items and the dentition)
              from a diversity of species with a broad range of feeding abilities. 
The data
              generated from this study will serve to tie together the current data on dental
              morphology and biomechanics. Furthermore it will move the field considerably
              closer to a comprehensive understanding of the form, function, and ecology of
              animal feeding--past and present--including how and why our own dentitions
              function as they do.
