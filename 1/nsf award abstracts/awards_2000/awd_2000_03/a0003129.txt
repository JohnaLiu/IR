Abstract    :
              Upon arriving at The City College of New York in 1981, Dr. Akins opened his
              research laboratory to both high school students and undergraduates with a keen
              interest in science, who were willing to work hard both academically and in the
              laboratory.  With the assistance of a cadre of like-minded faculty, Dr. Akins
              expanded this model by establishing the Center for Analysis of Structures and
              Interfaces (CASI), a major research center and training laboratory for high
              school students in their junior and senior years, high school chemistry and
              physics teachers, and undergraduate and graduate students.  These efforts have
              led to City College being one of the nation's leaders in providing Ph.Ds. to
              minority students. During the 1997-98 Academic Year, eleven underrepresented
              minority students obtained their Ph.Ds. at City College in chemistry or
              engineering.
