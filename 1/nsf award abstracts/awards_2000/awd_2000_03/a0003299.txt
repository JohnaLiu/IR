Abstract    :
              DGE-0003299

The Triangle Coalition for Science and Technology Education,
              through its Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellow Program, provides
              school teachers with an opportunity to bring their knowledge and experience to
              appropriate branches of the federal government that impact the educational
              system of the 
United States. Einstein Fellows bring a wealth of information
              and experience concerning the teaching and learning of science and mathematics
              in K-12 schools. This proposal requests funding to support one Albert Einstein
              Fellow to work in the Division of Graduate Education.  This Fellow's expertise
              would be benefical 
to the Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12 (GK-12) program
