Abstract    :
              In 1988, The University of Alabama's Office of Minority and Special Programs
              established the Comprehensive Minority Faculty and Student Development Program,
              a series of coordinated and integrated approaches to increase the number of
              ethnic minority students earning doctoral degrees in the science, mathematics,
              and engineering disciplines.  Efforts include summer research experiences for
              40 high school students annually; tutoring, faculty mentoring, research
              experiences and scholarships for 10 undergraduate students per year; and, eight
              graduate fellowships each year.  To date, 146 (66%) of the undergraduate
              program participants have earned a baccalaureate degree; 12 earned a master's
              degree; 27 earned the Ph.D.; and, 26 remain enrolled in graduate programs.
