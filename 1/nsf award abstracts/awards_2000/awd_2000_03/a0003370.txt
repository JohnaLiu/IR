Abstract    :
              The investigators will study the cosmic ray flux incident upon Earth during the
              Pleistocene epoch. The main effort is to measure the cosmogenic radionuclide
              10Be in samples of sea sediment obtained from the Blake Outer Ridge, together
              with other relevant physical and chemical properties of the sediments. Prior
              work by the investigators has demonstrated that the concentration of 10Be
              varies inversely with measures of the paleo magnetic field (paleointensity) of
              the sediments, and that it is unlikely that this relationship arises from
              climate forcing. Extension of the high-resolution record will address several
              problems raised by the earlier work. Specifically, the investigators will
              concentrate on understanding the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion (41,000 years
              ago) and the Blake Event (115,000 years ago).
