This award would support the continued
              development of the technique of computerized ionospheric tomography through
              application of this technique to the analysis of phase observations of radio
              signals from the TRANSIT satellites by a network of radio receivers.  The
              results of this analysis would be a collection of 2-dimensional images of the
              low latitude distribution of ionospheric electron density over a latitudinal
              swath of about 20 degrees.  About 15 such images are available for each 24 hour
              period.  These results would be examined to study the average daily behavior
              for a typical day in each season to establish a baseline behavior during solar
              minimum conditions.  Images corresponding to atypical behavior relating to
              special events such as solar eclipses, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions would be
              examined and interpreted to improve the understanding of ionospheric behavior
              under these circumstances.  All images constructed with applications of this
              technique would be made available through the means of Web access.
