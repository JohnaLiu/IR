Granitic plutons of the
              Coastal Maine Magmatic Province (CMMP) commonly display dramatic field
              relations that record interaction between magmas of markedly different
              composition (chemical and isotopic) and physical properties. Silicic magma
              chambers, derived from the crust, received influxes of denser mafic magma that
              spread out along the floor of these chambers to produce a compositional
              stratification know as Mafic and Silicic Layered Intrusions (MASLI). The
              spectacular field relations and large compositional variation in the vicinity
              of the interface between contrasting magma types are well document by recent
              studies. In contrast, the extent of physical and chemical coupling between the
              base of the chamber, that receives mafic influx, and the overlying silicic
              magma remains poorly understood. Three known or presumed MASLI plutons in the
              CMMP, the Vinalhaven, Deer Isle, and Mt. Waldo granites, have been selected for
              study to address this important issue. Specifically, what processes and other
              factors determine the extent to which heat and material are exchanged between
              contrasting magma types? Is heat and mass subsequently distributed to the upper
              reaches of the chamber? By combining textural, compositional and isotopic
              studies of zoned plagioclase and accessory minerals (using electron and
              ion-microprobe techniques), along with data for magmatic enclaves from each of
              the granites, the relative timing and extent of variation in composition of the
              magma from with individual minerals crystallized can be assessed. Comparison of
              internal variations among adjacent mineral grains will be used to constrain the
              relative extent to which material is redistributed within the chamber.
              Furthermore, studies such as this will enhance our understanding of magma
              chamber dynamics and growth, enable recognition of the contribution of mantle
              and crustal components in granite petrogenesis, and evaluate models for the
              growth and evolution of continental lithosphere.
