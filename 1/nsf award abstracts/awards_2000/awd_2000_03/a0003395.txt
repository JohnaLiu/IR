Paleomagnetic data tell us that the geomagnetic field
              changes polarity yet the causes and controls of this astonishing behavior
              remain a mystery. Furthermore, the frequency with which the field reverses has
              changed dramatically through time and has been steadily increasing from zero
              reversals in a 51 million year time interval in the Cretaceous (the Cretaceous
              Normal Superchron, or CNS) to about four per million in the more recent past.
              Why the field stopped reversing and why it started again is unknown. Was the
              geomagnetic field simply too strong to reverse? To address this issue, we
              require estimates of the average field strength for the recent past and the
              CNS. Despite major gains in paleointensity research, the average field
              intensities during these intervals is poorly constrained. Under this grant, the
              investigators will endeavor to improve the estimate of average paleointensity
              for the early Brunhes and for the CNS using basaltic glass samples from the
              Hawaii Drill Core and the Troodos Ophiolite, respectively.
