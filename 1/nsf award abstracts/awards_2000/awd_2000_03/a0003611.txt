Abstract    :
              The California Science Center Foundation will develop the California Science
              Center's Air and Space Gallery, a 12,000-square foot exhibit space.  The
              California Science Center will reopen Aerospace Hall (closed in 1998) with new
              and re-designed exhibits and offer a full complement of learning experiences. 
              Funding from NSF will support design, fabrication and core program development
              of the Air and Space Gallery.  The Gallery will feature four themed areas that
              explore the depth and breadth of aeronautics and space exploration:  Air and
              Aircraft; Humans and Their Spacecraft; Mission to the Planets; and Stars and
              Telescopes.  Also featured will be a Discovery Room for young learners and
              their parents, a changing exhibit gallery and educational programs for the
              public and for schools.
