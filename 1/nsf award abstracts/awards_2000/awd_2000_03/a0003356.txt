Modeling of geologic features is
              considerably assisted by an extensive data set that quantifies an adequate
              number of descriptive parameters of the feature in question.  Such studies on
              normal faults have prompted a significant step forward in understanding
              extensional tectonics, but no such population studies exist for thrust faults,
              which are common features in convergent tectonic settings.  This project will
              generate an extensive data set quantifying geometric parameters, displacement
              length scaling, population statistics, displacement transfer and similar items.
               It is expected that this research will provide a robust statistical foundation
              for description of the geometric properties of thrust faults, and thus such
              research should under pin a significantly improved understanding of thrust
              faults and convergent tectonics.
