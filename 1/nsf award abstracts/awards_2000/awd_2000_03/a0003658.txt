"Beluga Whales in the Bering and Chukchi
              Seas"

Beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) are found in the tens of
              thousands in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Seas. At least four distinct
              stocks have been identified by genetic analysis, and satellite tagging has
              shown that the migratory paths of some stocks link Canadian, American, and
              Russian waters. Belugas are an important subsistence species for many
              communities in Alaska and Canada, and are taken opportunistically in Chukotka.
              While recent studies have expanded our understanding of beluga ecology, many
              questions remain. For example, are there separate stocks of belugas that remain
              in Russian waters? Which North American stocks migrate to Russian waters and
              when? To answer these questions and to promote scientific cooperation
              throughout the region, especially with Russia, a workshop will be held in
              November 2000 with participants from Russia, Canada, and the United States.
              This effort is expected to lead to greater interaction among beluga scientists
              and indigenous experts in the region, and to a better understanding of the
              ecology of this important arctic species.
