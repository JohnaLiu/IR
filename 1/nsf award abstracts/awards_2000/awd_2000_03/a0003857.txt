Although there is a research base for how students learn many
              of the concepts in science, there is almost no research on the effectiveness of
              research-based curricula in classrooms.  The project provides the necessary
              tools and instruments to facilitate future research on how teachers use
              inquiry-based science curricula in high schools.  Developers are interviewed to
              determine their goals for the materials.  Publishers and implementation site
              personnel are interviewed to determine their view of how materials are
              implemented in the classroom.  Focus groups of teachers help set the issues to
              be investigated.  Instruments are developed and tested in classrooms by
              observing and interviewing teachers.  The preliminary research results and
              model instruments are published.
