Abstract    :
              This project involves participation in an historic cruise through the Northwest
              Passage on a Canadian icebreaker accompanying a second ship that is sailing in
              celebration of the anniversary of several Canadian historical events. A marine
              biologic sampling program and associated environmental measurements will be
              conducted in coastal waters of the Northwest Passage, Canada.   The samples
              collected during the cruise will be used to examine biogeographical patterns
              and the biocomplexity of benthic faunal populations.  The baseline information
              of environmental factors and benthic populations in this area is critical for
              comparative studies of an area undergoing dramatic warming during the past
              decade.  The warming may be causing significant changes in the quality and
              quantity of carbon reaching the seafloor.  The comparison of these data to
              future distributions of faunal assemblages will allow examination of long-term
              ecosystem change in a area that may be undergoing significant climate change
              driven by anthropological effects on the environment.
