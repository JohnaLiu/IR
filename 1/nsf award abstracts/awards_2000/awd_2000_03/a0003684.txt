A SGER exploratory investigation
              of the occurrence and characteristics of noctilucent clouds (NLC) at
              mid-latitudes will be carried out to investigate the unususal occurrences of
              these events at mid-latitudes during the summer. These clouds are more
              typically observed at polar latitudes (> 55 N) and the detection of NLCs during
              the 99 summer at Logan Utah on the two dates of 22/23 and 23/24 of June was by
              happenstance.  These two events may have been simply a rare occurrence with a
              low probability of re-occurrence. However, increases in NLC occurrence
              frequency and/or changes in their latitudinal extent have been linked to
              potentially serious changes taking place in the upper mesospheric climate. 
              This award will support a systematic series of optical observations with high
              resolution digital photography to determine the properties of these clouds were
              they to re-occur.  This work will be carried out over the summers of the next
              two years.  If the occurrence of mid-latitude NLC displays is indeed
              established and if they are found to be on the increase, then this study could
              have a profound influence on future NSF sponsored research efforts as such
              results may well portend major, long-term, global changes taking place in the
              upper atmosphere.
