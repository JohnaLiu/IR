This award supports a three-year collaborative research
              project between Professor Aaron Mitchell, Columbia University and Professor
              Mitsuhiro Shimizu of Meisei University in Tokyo, Japan.  The researchers will
              be undertaking a study of mechanics of chromatin-mediated repression in early
              meiotic genes in yeast.  The objective of the study is to understand how the
              genetic transcriptional machinery responds to changes in chromatin structure. 
              Chromatin is the complex of protein and DNA that comprises eukaryotic
              chromosomes.  The protein constituents are largely histones, an evolutionarily
              conserved group of proteins that coat DNA with little sequenced specificity. 
              Chromatin has long been thought to affect the expression of genes, and several
              biochemical mechanisms by which chromatin may govern gene expression have been
              explored.  Proposed studies examine directly two mechanisms by which chromatin
              may influence gene expression.  The studies focus on two yeast repressors,
              Rme1p and Ume6p, that function in regulation of meiosis in yeast.  The project
              brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary
              expertise and research capabilities.  The researchers hope to learn how a
              repressor can act over a substantial distance (2Kbp) to affect activity of
              several transcriptional activators and how does a proximal histone deacetylase
              inhibit promoter actifity.   Results of this research should be applicable to
              the understanding of transcriptional repression in plants and animals.  Through
              the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of
              basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The
              researchers plan to publish results of the research in scientific journals and
              report on the findings at scientific meetings.
