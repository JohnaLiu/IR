Abstract    :
              The importance of semiconductors in the contemporary industrial society is
              strikingly evident.  Their pivotal role in defense applications is equally
              manifest.  With its beginnings in the Second World War, the rapid post war
              developments in the science and technology of semiconductors show how basic
              science leads to revolutionary applications with profound impact on all aspects
              of life.

The symposium proposed will feature internationally known experts
              in the physics of semiconductors and related materials.  Their talks will focus
              on an exciting range of contemporary issues in the field and how they are being
              addressed with powerful experimental techniques and theoretical approaches. 
              While underscoring Purdue's role in the history of one of the major industrial
              revolutions of the 20th Century, it will serve to instruct and inspire the
              current generation of young and aspiring scientists by exposing them to a broad
              spectrum of current activities in semiconductors.

The symposium is to be
              held at Purdue University on October 21-22, 2000.
