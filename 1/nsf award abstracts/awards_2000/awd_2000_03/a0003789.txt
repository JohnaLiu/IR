This award supports Robert Constable and students from
              Cornell University in a collaboration with Joerg Siekmann of the Computer
              Science Department at the University of Saarland, Germany. The research funded
              by this award will focus on computer-based mathematical proofs. Current
              automated theorem prove non-trivial theorems, but must search huge spaces in
              order to do so, requiring a lot of time and computer resources, and a
              combination of automated tools and user interaction is necessary to solve
              complex problems.  In order to develop a new breed of proof planning systems,
              this reseach will lead to improvements in knowledge acquisition for computer
              proof planning, development of techniques to guide searches in computer theorem
              proving, standards for computer mathematical library functions, and user
              interfaces  Each of these results will have significance for industrial and
              educational applications. The opportunity this joint, collaborative research
              effort presents junior researchers is substantial, and the work done on this
              proposal will help institutionalize the relationship between the German and
              U.S. research groups.
