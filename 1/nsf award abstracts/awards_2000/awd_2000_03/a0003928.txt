This award supports Professor Perry L. McCarty, Director of
              the Western Region Hazardous Substance Research Center, Stanford University, to
              conduct collaborative research with Dr. Jaeho Bae, Department of Environmental
              Engineering, Inha University, Korea.  The joint study will investigate the
              process of biological degradation of chlorinated ethenes.  Principal objectives
              of the project include development of a numerical model that integrates the
              many factors involved in the reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes,
              and to verify the model using field data.
 
Because of their wide use in
              industry, chlorinated ethenes have become major contaminants of groundwater and
              soil.  Remediation of groundwater contaminated with chlorinated ethenes is very
              difficult because they are dense, only partially soluble in water, and
              relatively resistant to chemical and biological degradation.  Nevertheless,
              biological reductive dechlorination is one of the promising methods for
              bioremediation of contaminated sites, as it may be cost-effective compared to
              chemical and physical treatment, and it is also environmentally friendly as
              contaminants are degraded into non-toxic ethene.  The multiple processes
              involved in reductive dechlorination are highly complex, and our knowledge of
              this process is still rather limited.  This project will combine the
              complementary expertise and facilities of the American and Korean laboratories
              to advance our mutual understanding of the process.
