Abstract    :
              The Developmental Studies Center (DSC) will implement "Home, School and
              Community:  AfterSchool Math for Grades 3-5," a program that targets at-risk
              and low income children in afterschool programs.  AfterSchool Math trains youth
              workers to help students in grades 3-5 better understand measurement and
              geometry concepts, building on the success of the NSF-funded Home, School and
              Community mathematics program for grades K-2 (ESI #97-05421).  The project
              develops, field-tests and evaluates thirty math games and ten story guides,
              which support the social and mathematical development of children, while
              emphasizing cooperative learning.  The content for all materials will be
              aligned with national standards in mathematics.  A 12-hour professional
              development workshop for youth workers and an 18-hour workshop for facilitators
              or youth worker leaders are also planned.  Two training videos and a
              facilitator manual will be produced to support this aspect of the project. 
              Field testing will occur in Kansas, Louisiana and Missouri.  This proposal has
              been augmented to include a special emphasis on rural communities which doubles
              the number of field test sites from 50 to 100.  A Rural Outreach Specialist
              will conduct focus group meetings to determine needs unique to rural programs
              and lead the field testing in these communities.  It is anticipated that over
              3,200 youth workers will be trained and a national cadre of more than 300 youth
              worker leaders will be created.
