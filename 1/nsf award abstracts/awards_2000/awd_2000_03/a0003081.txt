Abstract    :
              Washington MESA is a statewide partnership of school districts, families and
              alumni, community organizations, higher education, industry, business, and
              government.  In 1982, MESA served 88 students in four schools; today it serves
              over 3,000 traditionally underrepresented students in 71 schools and 17 school
              districts across the state.  MESA promotes academic achievement by increasing
              students' interest in science, mathematics, and engineering (SME); expanding
              students' career options to include SME fields; and, by developing students'
              habits of high expectations and success.  Services provided by MESA include
              tutoring, mentoring, summer technical camps, internships, and after-school
              enrichment for students, parents and teachers. Ninety-four percent of the 374
              MESA students that were seniors in 1999 enrolled in postsecondary institutions.
              Sixty-eight percent of these students are pursing degrees in SME fields.
