This two-year award for U.S.-France collaboration involves A.
              Marjatta Lyyra and her group at Temple University and Michel Broyer and Amanda
              Ross at the University of Lyon I.  They propose to conduct experimental and
              theoretical studies of electronic states of alkali atoms and dimers using a new
              photoassociation technique and high resolution multiphon spectroscopy. The
              Temple University group brings to this collaboration experimental expertise in
              high frequency resolution and triple resonance spectroscopy.   This is
              complemented by the French group's theoretical expertise and their precise
              techniques in Fourier Transform Spectrometry and ab initio and long-range
              calculations.

This award represents the U.S. side of a joint proposal to the
              NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will
              cover travel funds and living expenses for the U.S. investigator and graduate
              students.  CNRS will support the visits of the French researchers to the United
              States. The collaboration will advance understanding of the behavior of
              molecular interactions and future experiments in cold atoms. mechanical
              properties of magnets and the approach for tailoring sample properties for
              application in magnetic recording media.
