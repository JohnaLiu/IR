Abstract    :
              While maintaining a vigorous chemistry research program involving under-graduate
              and graduate students, Dr. Lopez-Garriga also manages an extensive K-12
              outreach agenda.  Through the Science on Wheels program, Lopez-Garriga has
              intrigued and excited thousands of elementary and secondary students by
              conducting simple experiments at K-12 schools throughout Puerto Rico. His
              undergraduate and graduate students helped Lopez-Garriga provide training in
              cooperative and active learning techniques to 500 K-12 teachers during the past
              eight years. In addition, 103 teachers enhanced their scientific competency
              through the GLOBE program (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the
              Environment). The Puerto Rico GLOBE franchise is headed by Lopez-Garriga. 
              Since 1990, Dr. Lopez-Garriga has mentored 35 graduate students of which eleven
              are currently pursuing doctoral degrees.  Lopez-Garriga is presently a member
              of the faculty at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez.
