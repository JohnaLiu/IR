This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              involves Govind P. Agrawal and Robert W. Boyd of the Institute of Optics,
              University of Rochester and Albert Le Floch and his group at the Universite de
              Rennes in Rennes, France.   The investigators will cooperate on several topics,
              all related to nonlinear optics, nonlinear dynamics, and lasers, including
              nonlinear effects in fiber lasers, nonlinear dynamics of coupled optical
              systems and nonlinear optical cavities. The US group brings to this
              collaboration expertise in theory.  This is complemented by experimental
              expertise of the French group. 

This award represents the US side of a joint
              proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research
              (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US
              investigators, graduate and undergraduate students.  The CNRS will support the
              visits of French researchers to the United States. The collaboration will
              advance fundamental understanding of the physical processes that determine
              nonlinear materials, dynamics of optical systems, and effects in fiber lasers.
