Geodynamicists have recently crossed a significant
              threshold by showing that plate tectonic styles of mantle convection arise
              self-consistently in numerical models that include simple rheological
              descriptions of lithospheric failure. The investigators propose to further
              develop 3-D spherical models of mantle convection and plate tectonics to
              include a more complete physical treatment of lithospheric failure, or plate
              boundary formation. They will use a tensor extension of scalar "damage theory"
              to account for enhanced weakening oriented according to maximum shear strain. A
              reasonable and significant hypothesis is that alternating ridge-transform
              geometries arise naturally in such models, and that the one-sidedness of
              subduction zones may also be related to oriented strain-rate weakening deep
              within fault zones. An anisotropic formulation of lithospheric failure rheology
              requires Lagrangian tracking, or advection, of tensor viscosity -- a
              non-trivial task facilitated by methods they have developed for tracking
              chemical species in mantle convection. The investigators also propose to
              continue their focussed investigation into the role of a pronounced
              sublithospheric low viscosity zone (LVZ) in promoting plate tectonics. Other
              related work supported by this grant will include ongoing studies of mantle
              mixing, thermal coupling of the core and mantle, the dynamics of diffuse plate
              boundaries, and interactions of thermo-chemical plumes with plate-scale flow.
