Abstract    :
              This project supports an innovative form of the Athabaskan Languages Conference,
              an annual conference which brings together researchers, teachers and members of
              Athabaskan-speaking communities to stimulate each other toward continual
              improvement in linguistic research, Athabaskan language pedagogy, and minority
              and endangered language retention methods.

The Athabaskan language family is
              spread over a large area of North America, with concentrations in Western
              Canada, Alaska, the west coast of the United States, and the Southwest. With
              the possible exception of Navajo, all the Athabaskan languages are both highly
              endangered and incompletely researched.

The 2001 Athabaskan Languages
              Conference will be hosted by the UCLA Department of Linguistics, May 18-20,
              2001. Papers are solicited in all areas of Athabaskanist inquiry. Organized
              sessions will focus on Language and Pedagogy, Language and Theory, New Data,
              and Community-Academy Relations. A special workshop on the instrumental
              analysis of voice quality is planned for Sunday, May 20, 2001. Researchers and
              teachers will learn from experts in acoustic and articulatory phonetics about
              how to measure subtle effects in their data which may previously have gone
              undescribed. A formal call for papers will be issued in January, with a
              submission deadline of March 2, 2001.
