Most erupting lavas have carried bubbles at some point
              during their ascent and emplacement. The effect of these bubbles on the
              rheological properties of magma will in turn affect the rate and style of
              eruption. The goal of the proposed work is thus to determine the effects of
              bubbles on the rheological properties of magmas and lavas for the ranges of
              physical parameters that are appropriate for magmatic systems. We will use
              three different research approaches, namely, numerical calculations,
              theoretical analysis, and experimental measurements. The numerical simulations
              will use the boundary integral technique to calculate the interaction and
              deformation of bubbles. The theoretical work will involve calculating bubble
              shapes and resulting flow in the limit that bubbles become highly deformed. In
              both the numerical and theoretical analyses, we will calculate all the
              components of the volume-averaged stress tensor. We can thus obtain
              
quantities such as the effective shear viscosity and normal stress
              differences. We will make the  experimental measurements in a large-volume,
              transparent viscometer that we have designed and built. The experimental
              measurements can be used to verify and extend results, and  will allow us to
              study macroscopic features of the flows that might result from the
              non-Newtonian behaviour of the bulk suspension. We will also develop
              closed-form expressions for all our results that should be transferable to
              other problems and applications, such as models for eruption processes and lava
              flow models.
