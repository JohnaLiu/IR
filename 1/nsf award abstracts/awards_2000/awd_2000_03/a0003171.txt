This award will provide for the continuation of
              mesosphere and lower thermosphere temperature and wind observations from Ft.
              Collins, CO.  The extension of the existing 9 year database over the 5 years of
              this award to 14 years will make possible a detailed analysis of the long term
              trends in this atmospheric region, which is largely a result of the solar flux
              variation.  Current analysis shows that there is a possibility of a small
              temperature change that might be a result of the anthropogenic influence
              arising from global change.  However, at present this conclusion is only
              tentative as the measurement series is too short compared with the length of
              the solar cycle (11 years) to put this conclusion on a sound footing. 
              Instrumental improvements will also provide for possible measurements of long
              terms variations of horizontal wind speed and direction as well as decadal
              temperature trends.
