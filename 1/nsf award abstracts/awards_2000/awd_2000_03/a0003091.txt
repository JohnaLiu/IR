Abstract    :
              During his 30 years at New Mexico State University, Dr. Kuehn mentored 49
              undergraduate minority students. Eleven of Dr. Kuehn's mentees earned  master's
              degrees in science, eight earned doctoral degrees, nineteen earned medical
              doctor degrees, and eleven entered the technical workforce.  One of Dr. Kuehn's
              mentees became the first Native American woman to receive a doctorate in
              chemistry in the United States.  In 1992, Dr. Kuehn established a bridge
              program to facilitate the transfer of Native American students from five New
              Mexico community colleges to four-year academic programs.  Since the inception
              of this bridge program, 64% (72) of the American Indian participants
              successfully transferred into baccalaureate degree programs in science. 
              Graduates of the bridge program include two American Indian Ph.D. recipients,
              seven master's degree recipients, and 23 baccalaureate degree recipients.
