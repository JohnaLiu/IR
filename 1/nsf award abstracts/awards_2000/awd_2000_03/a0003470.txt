The objective of this project is to continue
              investigating the near-field (3-4 km from source) seismic and acoustic response
              of a volcano to the explosive discharge of ash and gas.  We propose to develop
              a computer model that simulates the motion in the fluid and rock associated
              with the discharge of a pressurized mixture of ash and gas through the volcano
              and atmosphere.  Discrete, explosive eruptions are commonly accompanied by
              shallow volcanic earthquakes and initiate atmospheric sound waves. Existing
              near-field seismic and acoustic models of volcanic eruptions are either
              formulated for incompressible, steady flowing ash-steam mixture or are one
              dimensional.  The proposed model will simulate the 3 dimensional explosive
              discharge of an ash-gas mixture through a crater (filled with either air, steam
              or water) and into the atmosphere.   Applications of the computer code will
              include modeling the acoustic and earthquake signals associated with eruptions
              at Sakurajima volcano in Japan and Ruapehu volcano in New Zealand.  The merit
              of this project pertains to the improvement of volcano monitoring capabilities
              by identifying physical processes related to fluid transport from
              characteristic features of acoustic and seismic signals.
