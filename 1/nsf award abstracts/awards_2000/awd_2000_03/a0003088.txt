Abstract    :
              The Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP) was created in 1986 to engage
              undergraduate minority students in research experiences with faculty members,
              to accelerate each student's socialization into the discipline, and to foster
              the sense of a community of scholars among all program participants. To date,
              6,212 undergraduate students have participated in the SROP summer experience,
              including 2,734 science, mathematics and engineering (SME) majors. Students
              from 373 colleges and universities, including 73 minority-serving institutions,
              have participated. Of the SME alumni, 58% are women and 87% are from
              underrepresented minority groups. Ninety-seven percent of the SROP alumni have
              either graduated or are still enrolled.  Of those that have received their
              bachelor's degrees, 77% are pursuing or have pursued advanced study. 
              Eighty-six SROP alumni have already earned their Ph.D. degrees, including 28
              majoring in SME fields.
