Abstract    :
              This grant supports continuing research on the interpretation of Schumann
              Resonance observations at several sites around the globe. The surface of the
              planet Earth and the ionosphere that surrounds it constitute a spherical
              capacitor, which serves as a resonant cavity for extremely low-frequency
              electromagnetic waves. The amplitude of the fundamental mode (about 8 Hz) is
              related to world-wide lightning activity. Observations of the Schumann
              Resonances (SR) at a given location reveal a background signal on which are
              superimposed transients caused by intense thunderstorms.  The three main
              regions of global lightning activity are tropical Africa, tropical South
              America, and Indonesia.  This work focuses on lightning in the first of these
              regions, the African convective or "chimney" zone.  Observations at the SR
              field station in Rhode Island indicate a four-to-five day periodicity in
              lightning activity over Africa.  Two possible explanations of this periodicity
              are African easterly waves or the global 5-day wave.  One objective of the
              program is to analyze the SR data and supporting observations from satellites,
              rainfall observations, and global weather maps, to determine the cause of the
              periodicity. Another objective is to explain the apparent tendency for
              lightning to have positive polarity over the African continent and negative
              polarity offshore over the Atlantic Ocean.
