Abstract    :
              In this research project we are interested in exploring the extent ex post
              inequalities between nations can arise when countries are ex ante identical. We
              study a model where imperfectly observable human capital investments are
              introduced in an otherwise standard neoclassical trade framework. Due to
              interaction between an informational externality and general equilibrium price
              effects, inequalities may arise in equilibrium when countries specialize in
              industries with different intensities in human capital. Citizens in the country
              specializing as a low human capital country are worse off than citizens in the
              country specializing as a high human capital country.  Because incentives to
              invest are lower in the low human capital country the situation is
              self-enforcing. Incentives are bad in the poor country two reasons: 1) with few
              investors someone who "looks good" is more likely an individual with low human
              capital that got a "lucky draw"; 2) the possibility to import goods intensive
              in human capital from the other country makes human capital less valuable
              compared to a situation where countries don't trade. In our research we will
              explore how these effects interact and the extent the model provides a
              rationale for specialization as well as provide a number of testable
              implications of the model.
