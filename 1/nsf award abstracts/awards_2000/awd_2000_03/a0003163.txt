Abstract    :
              The informal economy, or the production of licit goods and services outside
              formal regulatory structures, encompasses a wide range of activities and
              products, including childcare, street vending, and home-based light industrial
              work.  Most research on the informal economy focuses on demonstrating its size
              and importance, identifying the causes of its expansion, or understanding its
              relationship to the formal economy.  Research has neglected issues relating to
              how participation in informal modes of labor affects individuals, and how these
              effects differ for men and women.  This project rectifies these oversights by
              directly comparing the opportunities, experiences, and identities of men and
              women who are self-employed in New York City's informal economy.  Using
              snowball sampling methods to recruit respondents with pin-up advertisements,
              newspaper classifieds, and referrals from other sample participants, the
              project gathers data from in-depth interviews about informal work histories,
              typical work days, and work, gender, and personal identities.  In addition to
              describing how men and women go about their informal work on a day-to-day
              basis, get started in informal work, find clients, and earn income, the data
              show how informal work affects individual identity and how identity shapes the
              informal work process.
