Abstract    :
              The Northeast Center for Telecommunications Technology (NCTT) has led the
              development of work-relevant, industry-validated, competency-based curricula
              and instructional materials for use in secondary through community college
              programs in telecommunications technology. NCTT has designed and implemented an
              innovative instructional delivery system that takes advantage of current
              electronic technologies and has provided extensive opportunities for
              professional development of faculty, and for the education both of students and
              of incumbent workers in the telecommunications industry. These accomplishments
              are due to extensive and successful partnerships with educational institutions
              and with industry. 

The goals for the Center are:
(a) to establish the
              modular curriculum system as one of the key elements that leads to the ongoing
              success and utility of the technicians in the workplace; 
(b) to provide
              faculty with integrated, accessible and relevant professional growth
              opportunities; 
(c) to encourage all learners, but especially those
              underrepresented in the workplace, into educational programs that lead to
              participation in the telecommunications workplace; and 
(d) to ensure that the
              quality and relevancy of its goods and services provide resources to maintain
              the NCTT as a permanent center in telecommunications and related technologies.
