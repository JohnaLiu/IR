Metamorphic processes include the chemical and physical
              transformations that occur to rocks subjected to elevated temperatures and
              pressures in the earth's crust.  Metamorphic processes are an integral part of
              the long-term cycles that control the distribution of elements among the solid
              earth, oceans, and atmosphere.  This research examines the application of
              reflectance spectroscopy in the visible and near infrared wavelength region
              (350-2500 nm) as an alternative method for characterizing the mineralogy of
              metamorphic rocks and generating maps of mineral distribution.  Spectroscopic
              methods offer two distinct advantages relative to conventional mapping methods:
               1) acquisition of spectra is rapid and inexpensive, and 2) measurements can be
              made in the field with portable spectrometers or remotely with aircraft or
              satellite based imaging spectrometers.  In this project, methods are being
              developed to map the distribution of metamorphic minerals using advanced
              airborne and satellite-based remote sensing data, which are being provided
              through a unique partnership with NASA.  Mapping methods being developed under
              this research project, however, can be applied to address many other earth
              science problems and are currently being implemented in studies of mineral
              deposit exploration, vegetation classification and land cover change, and
              forestry resource monitoring.
