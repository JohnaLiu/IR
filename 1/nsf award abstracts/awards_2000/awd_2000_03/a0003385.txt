The Consortium for Oceanographic Research and Education (CORE)
              will undertake the formation of a "Coordinating Committee for Research at Ocean
              Observatories" with broad interdisciplinary representation from the ocean and
              earth sciences communities.  This group will focus on the utilization of fixed
              ocean observatories (both cabled observatories and moored ocean buoys) to
              address basic research questions using sustained time series observations and
              interactive experiments. A Planning Office will also be established at CORE to
              assist the Coordinating Committee.  The Planning Office will serve as the staff
              for the Coordinating Committee and will be responsible for day-to-day
              management of Committee activities. Due to the wide interest in the ocean
              science community in a program of basic research utilizing ocean observatories
              it appears appropriate to constitute this committee under the auspices of
              CORE.
