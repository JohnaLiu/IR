Abstract    :
              The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network is requesting two years of
              support from the National Science foundation (NSF) to provide technical
              assistance in the Foundation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities
              (HBCU-UP) Program.  The goal of the HBCU-UP Program is to strengthen the
              Nation's workforce by enhancing the quality of undergraduate Science,
              Mathematics, Engineering and Technology (SMET) programs at HBCUs.  Support from
              the Foundation will enable the QEM Network to:

(1) provide on-site technical
              assistance to six of the 1999 and six of the 2000 HBCU-UP awardee institutions
              with technical assistance linked to critical needs identified within each of
              the targeted institution's HBCU-UP funded projects;
(2) enlarge the pool of
              potential HBCU-UP grantees through the conduct each year of The Quality
              Education for Minorities (QEM) Network is requesting two years of support from
              the National Science foundation (NSF) to provide technical assistance in the
              Foundation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU-UP) Program. 
              The goal of the HBCU-UP Program is to strengthen the Nation's workforce by
              enhancing the quality of undergraduate Science, Mathematics, Engineering and
              Technology (SMET) programs at HBCUs.
 (3) utilize the regional workshops to
              offer general technical assistance to, and serve as a dissemination vehicle for
              all current HBCU-UP grantees.

Expected outcomes are that each of the six
              targeted 1999 and of the 2000 HBCU-UP grantees will successfully achieve their
              expected accomplishments for the year in which technical assistance is
              provided.  In addition, at lease 20 (67 percent) of the 30 HBCUs participating
              in the invitational regional workshops in years one and two will submit HBCU-UP
              proposals, at lease 10 (50 percent) of which will be successful the following
              year in obtaining HBCU-UP awards.

In year two, special workshop sessions
              will be held for institutions whose proposals were unsuccessful in the previous
              year's competition.  HBCUs that participated in the workshops in year one but
              did not submit proposals in the next Program competition will be replaced with
              new HBCUs if they do not demonstrate sufficient commitment to submitting a
              proposal during the next competition.
