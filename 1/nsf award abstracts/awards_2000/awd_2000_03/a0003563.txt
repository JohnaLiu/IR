Abstract    :
                  The interaction of HOx radicals with tropospheric aerosol surfaces is
              believed to be significant, but there is little information regarding the
              mechanisms and rate of such processes.  This project is a laboratory
              investigation of the interaction of OH and HO2 radicals with tropospheric
              aerosols.  A low-pressure flow tube technique will be used, coupled with
              chemical ionization mass spectrometry for detection of reactants and products. 
              Various organic and inorganic surfaces will be examined, to simulate reactions
              occurring on natural and anthropogenically influenced aerosols, including
              seasalt and sulfates.  The influence of radical reactions on water uptake by
              these surfaces will also be examined using ellipsometry, a non-destructive
              optical technique.
