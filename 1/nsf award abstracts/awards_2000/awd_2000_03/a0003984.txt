Abstract    :
              0003984  Jacobs-Young  This proposal was submitted under the guidelines for
              Research Planning Grants and Career Advancement Awards for Minority Scientists
              and Engineers, NSF 94-147 and is more specifically in response to the Minority
              Research Planning Grants (MRPG) opportunities of this announcement. The
              objective of this research is to study the effect of enzyme pretreatment of
              wood chips in the Kraft pulping process as a means of reducing pulp mill
              emissions and effluents.  Previous work has shown enzyme pretreatment of wood
              pulp to be effective and has looked at the role of chip thickness, specie and
              enzyme combinations.  The current work will be focused on the topological
              effects of enzyme pretreatment on delignification in Kraft pulping.  This
              planning grant will afford the PI the opportunity to obtain preliminary results
              on which to base a full research proposal. ***
