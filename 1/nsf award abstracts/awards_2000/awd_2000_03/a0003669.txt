              agency reporting requirements and disseminating program and project information
              to the larger digital libraries community.  The effort is intended to will help
              facilitate the exchange of ideas, techniques, and procedures necessary to
              achieve a coordinated  and integrated program, provide tools to promote
              interaction among Digital Libraries researchers and users around the world, and
              gather performance data for multiple purposes. The funding provides
              administrative and technical support in several distinct areas:
- Maintaining
              the Digital Libraries Initiative World Wide Web Portal
              
(www.dli2.nsf.gov)
-Collecting, organizing and making DLI project
              intellectual products 
available to a broad audience.
-Providing logistical
              and program support for the Digital Libraries 
Initiative All-Projects
              Meetings held semiannually.
-Creating and maintaining access capabilities at
              NSF and other 
agency sites for project testbed demonstrations.
-Assisting in
              project coordination and high-level "interoperability"
