Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop an undergraduate curriculum in
              neuroinformatics at UCLA.  Neuroinformatics brings together the methods and
              concepts of neuroscience, informatics, and computation that are necessary to
              understand the human brain and all its complexity.  Neuroinformatics offers
              neuroscience new opportunities for extracting understanding from data and
              meaning from measurements. The new curriculum will prepare a new generation of
              informatically oriented neuroscientists by specifically introducing them to
              neuoroinformatic methods and principles while they are still undergraduates. 
              This curriculum will be made freely available to colleges and universities
              throughout the nation.  This program will be empirically evaluated and modified
              based upon the evaluations and all instructional protocols will be carefully
              and complete documented.   Neuroinformatics, although a young science, holds
              great promise for deepening our knowledge of the human brain and its
              function.

This research is funded in part by the National Science Foundation
              through its participation in the Human Brain Project, which is a Federal
              interagency research initiative, mandated by Congress as part of the "Decade of
              the Brain".
