ABSTRACT

Jennifer
              A. Doudna, a Professor at Yale University in the Department of Molecular
              Biophysics and Biochemistry is the recipient of the 2000 Alan T. Waterman
              award.  She has conducted innovative research that led to the development of a
              technique that facilitates crystallization of large RNA molecules, has
              determined the crystal structure of catalytic RNA molecules and a RNA molecule
              that forms the ribonucleoprotein core of the signal recognition particle, and
              has deciphered structural features of those molecules that permit a greater
              understanding of the mechanistic basis of RNA function in both catalysis and in
              protein synthesis.  
Her current research is reshaping basic theories
              regarding the roles of metal ions in ribozyme function.  No longer viewed as
              strict metalloenzymes, some ribozymes can access alternative catalytic
              mechanisms depending on the identity and availability of metal ions. Similarly,
              reaction conditions can allow different folding pathways to predominate, with
              divalent cations sometimes playing opposing roles.
