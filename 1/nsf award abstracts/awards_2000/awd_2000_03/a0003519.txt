Abstract    :
              The Children's Museum of Houston, in cooperation with Scholastic Entertainment,
              the National Weather Service and the American Meteorological Society (AMS),
              will develop, produce and nationally circulate two (2) copies of a 2,500-sq.ft.
              interactive exhibit.  Using the popular icon of the Magic School Bus, the
              exhibit will take young children on a journey of discovery to explore the
              science involved in the Earth's weather.  The exhibit, "The Magic School Bus
              Gets Weather Wise," and accompanying educational materials and programs will be
              bilingual in Spanish and English and will support national and Texas standards
              for science and mathematics learning for children aged 5-10.  It is estimated
              that the exhibit and programs will serve 2,000,000 children and adults in 36
              national venues over six (6) years.

Weather Exploration Stations will
              precede the exhibit to encourage community engagement prior to the exhibit's
              arrival at the host venue.  AMS scientists, local meteorologists and media
              weathercasters will assist visitor experiences and help museums with strategies
              for publicity campaigns and development of local programming.  

The visiting
              audiences of children and their families will learn meteorology is a study of
              weather, there are different types of weather, a variety of tools are used in
              predicting weather and the water cycle plays a role in weather events. 
              Visitors will read data from maps, graphs, thermometers, anemometers,
              experiment with variables and model weather conditions using interactive
              exhibit components.
