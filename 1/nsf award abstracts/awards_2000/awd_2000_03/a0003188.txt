This award addresses the quantitative
              physics of electron energization in the auroral E region which is known to be
              highly turbulent during times of vigorous auroral activity with values of  the
              electron temperature reaching high values of 3000 K or greater.  This electron
              heating is thought to be generated by waves (Farley-Buneman) or by the
              two-stream instability.  The region where this electron heating occurs is
              located between 100 and 120 km where the electrons are magnetized (i.e.,
              gyrates around the magnetic field line) and the ions are constrained by
              collisions to move in the direction of the neutral wind.  The rate of electron
              heating would be calculated as a part of the development of a kinetic model for
              the electron energization in the auroral E-region caused by a large amplitude
              turbulent electric field.  A numerical model represented by a Fokker-Planck
              code for the electron distribution function would be modified to include the
              relevant physical processes that become active by the presence of these
              turbulent electric fields.  The successful execution of this award would
              provide an understanding and predictive capability for the operation of
              navigation, communication, and surveillance systems.
