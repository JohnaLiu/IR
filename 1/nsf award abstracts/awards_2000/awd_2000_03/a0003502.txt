Abstract    :
              COSI Columbus will develop "Speed," a traveling exhibition.  "Speed" is a
              6,000-square-foot, interactive traveling exhibition introducing visitors to the
              science of speed.  Visitors experience extreme and slow speeds through a
              variety of interactives.  The exhibition emphasizes the role of speed -- that
              is, the physical phenomenon of changing motion over time -- in governing
              biological, geological and electronic processes as well as the central role of
              mathematics as the language of physical science.
