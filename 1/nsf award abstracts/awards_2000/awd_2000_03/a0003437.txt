Bhushan
This award supports a third year of funding for Bharat
              Bhushan, two graduate students, and a postdoctoral student from Ohio State
              University in a collaboration with Walter Arnold of the Department of Applied
              Science at the Fraunhofer Institute for Nondestructive Testing (IZFP) in
              Saarbruecken, Germany.  The research funded by this award will make use of the
              techniques in dynamic force microscopy developed at the IZFP, also called
              ultrasonic atomic force microscopy (AFM), which can be used to measure static
              friction at velocities several orders of magnitude larger than that used in
              conventional AFM.  Localized sensitivity measurements of ceramics and polymer
              composites can be made to a degree not possible with other techniques.  The
              collaboration will make it possible to transfer the German technology to the
              Computer Microtribology and Contamination Laboratory at Ohio State.  The
              research plan will develop analytical tools and computer models to gain insight
              into the elasticity on nonhomogeneous materials, which could ultimately lead to
              new low-friction materials and useful mechanical property measurement
              techniques.  This joint collaborative research effort also presents junior
              researchers with the opportunity to work internationally, and the work done on
              this proposal will help institutionalize the relationship between the German
              and U.S. research groups.
