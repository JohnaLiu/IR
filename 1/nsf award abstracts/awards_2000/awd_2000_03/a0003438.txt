Title: Triggering and Inhibition of Large Earthquakes in the Nankai
              Trough, Japan

The Nankai Trough is formed by the subduction of the
              Philippine Sea Plate beneath southeast Japan. This thrust zone gives rise to
              great (M = 8) earthquakes every ~190 years, but the shortest repeat period in
              more than 1000 years was the 90 years after the 1854 Ansei earthquake. In
              addition, the 1944 Tonankai earthquake, possibly for the first time, did not
              extend northeastward into the Suruga Bay as previous great earthquakes in the
              Nankai Trough. 
Modeling shows that rather small stresses, when applied over
              the whole fault surface, are surprisingly effective in inhibiting or triggering
              large earthquakes in highly stressed regions. It is therefore suggestive that
              postseismic strain diffusion from the inland Nobi earthquake (M > 8) of 1891
              may have affected the Coulomb failure level on the Tonankai fault consistent
              with the 1944 occurrence, i.e. the western section failed early but the eastern
              (Tokai) section did not fail. Using a computer simulation of the earthquake
              process, we propose to model the effect of small stress changes across a fault
              and investigate whether the level of stress due to strain diffusion from the
              great Nobi earthquake was indeed sufficient to trigger a 1944 size event. In
              addition, we plan to evaluate whether the inhibiting stress from Nobi
              earthquake, applied to the eastern part of the fault, is sufficient to
              temporarily delay the (Tokai) earthquake in excess of the historical repeat
              time. 
In more general terms, large earthquakes generate long-term and
              far-ranging stress perturbations that can influence the timing of large
              earthquakes on other faults. Therefore, the research proposed here is not
              strictly limited to large earthquakes in Japan, but rather anywhere.
