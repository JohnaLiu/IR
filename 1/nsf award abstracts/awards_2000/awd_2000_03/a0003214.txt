Abstract    :
              The project will explore and demonstrate the possibilities and advantages of
              international cooperation for the creation and delivery of complex literary and
              linguistic documents as encoded XML files.   The University of Trier brings
              strong computer science, lexicographical, and philological expertise to the
              project.  The University of Virginia Library and other departments have a long
              and successful record of applying SGML and XML encoding to humanities and other
              textual material, along with considerable capabilities for online delivery for
              tens of thousands of text.  This particular project will bring these strengths
              to bear on Middle High German Interlinked, a full-text archive and Medieval
              German Dictionaries collaboratory.  Prior efforts at Virginia to interlink the
              Oxford English Dictionary with texts of Early American fiction have been of
              value in examining the influence of pre-1850 American fiction on the
              development of the modern English language and usage.  Part of the project will
              be focussed on evaluation and implementation of web interfaces for multiple
              user communities.
