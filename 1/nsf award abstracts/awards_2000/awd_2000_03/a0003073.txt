Abstract    :
              A commitment to diversity in the microbiological sciences at all educational
              levels is embedded in the programs of the American Society for Microbiology
              (ASM).  Since 1980, ASM has awarded 34 fellowships to minority graduate
              students to support completion of their doctoral research.  Fifty-three percent
              of the graduate fellows completed advanced degrees in the microbiological
              sciences; the remaining fellows continue their graduate or postdoctoral
              training. Nine of the doctoral degree recipients entered the professoriate.  At
              the undergraduate level, ASM partnered with the National Institutes of Health
              to provide summer research fellowships under the supervision of ASM mentors. 
              One hundred eighty-five research fellowships have been awarded since the
              program's inception in 1986.  Thirty former undergraduate fellows completed
              doctoral degrees, 18 completed master's degrees and 92 completed baccalaureate
              degrees. ASM pre-college outreach strategies expose middle and high school
              students to career opportunities and role models while celebrating the
              contributions of underrepresented minority scientists.
