On the path of modernization most societies go through what
              demographers call "fertility transition", the change from large to small
              numbers of offspring.  In an overpopulated world, few social facts are more
              important to understand than the local causes of fertility transition.  This
              project by anthropological demographers at the University of Washington
              enhances our incomplete understanding of the fertility transition in China.  It
              studies how socioeconomic, cultural forces have produced a particular pattern
              and process of fertility change. The project will establish the late imperial
              Chinese demographic regime, then examine fertility changes in the 20th century.
               The project will focus on lineage populations in Xiaoshan county, Zhejiang
              province.  It will select lineage populations representing different local
              environmental variations, levels of economic development and economic
              specialization. It will conduct a family demographic history survey of current
              lineage populations as a means of studying fertility processes in the 20th
              century.  Ethnographic and archival research will also be conducted to provide
              a sociocultural context as well as data on local customs pertaining to
              demographic processes.  This project, designed to collect a combined set of
              survey, genealogical, ethnographic and archival data, can contribute to an
              in-depth understanding of the trajectories and sociocultural mechanisms of
              Chinese demographic change.
