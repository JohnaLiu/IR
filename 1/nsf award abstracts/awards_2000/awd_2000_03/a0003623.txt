Abstract    :
              The Self-Reliance Foundation (SRF) will implement a comprehensive three-year
              project that provides Hispanics with greater access to science resources and
              increases their participation in informal science activities.  The Hispanic
              National Community Science Festivals Project makes optimal use of radio and
              print media, as well as the Internet, to deliver much-needed services to the
              families in their homes and communities.  First, the SRF will partner with the
              Hispanic Radio Network (HRN) and the Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation (HBC) to
              reach major Hispanic markets in Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, Dallas and Yakima,
              Washington.  A community coalition, including members of the radio station,
              community organizations and science centers, will be created in each of the
              targeted locales to plan events and support the project.  

Radio broadcasts
              will include information on community science festivals organized by science
              centers in these cities.  Daily science radio capsules will also be developed,
              produced and distributed nationwide.  Topics for radio capsules will include
              parental involvement and participation in informal science activities, and
              pathways to science careers.  The Self-Reliance Foundation will serve as a
              clearing-house for community science resources by establishing an 800
              number-hotline and bilingual Internet site with referral information on science
              opportunities within the community.  It is anticipated that the festivals alone
              will reach 100,000-200,000 visitors per weekend, while broadcasts have the
              potential to reach the majority of the U.S. Hispanic population of 32 million
              people.
