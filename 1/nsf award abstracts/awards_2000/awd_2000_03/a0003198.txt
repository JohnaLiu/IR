Abstract    :
              The investigators will study middle atmosphere composition, structure and
              dynamics using sodium lidar measurements.  There are two parts to the proposed
              effort:  1) analysis and interpretation of the wind, temperature, and sodium
              density data obtained at the Starfire Optical Range in New Mexico between 1998
              and 2000, and 2) the study of thermal tides and gravity wave momentum, heat,
              and constituent transport using observations made by a sodium lidar at the Maui
              Space Surveillance Site (MSSS) beginning in January 2000.  The Starfire data
              will be used to characterize the seasonal variations in wave activity and
              momentum, heat, and constituent fluxes in the mesopause region at a
              mid-latitude continental site.  A similar set of observations will also be
              collected at the Maui facility, a low-latitude, mid-ocean site.  These
              observations are made feasible by using the 3.7-meter steerable telescope at
              Maui as the lidar receiver.  Both nighttime and daytime observations will be
              conducted to study tidal perturbation of winds and temperature and to study
              gravity wave transport processes and their seasonal variations.  The
              low-latitude tide and flux observations will be compared to similar mid
              latitude data from previous measurements made at Starfire and Urbana, Illinois.
               The study will contribute to knowledge about gravity wave dynamics in the
              middle atmosphere with application to studies of global change.
