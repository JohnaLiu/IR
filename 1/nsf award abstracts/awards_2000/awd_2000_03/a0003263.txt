Abstract    :
              This grant provides support for the CC2001 computer science curriculum project,
              which is a joint undertaking of the Computer Society of the IEEE and the
              Association for Computing Machinery (ACM to develop new curricular guidelines
              for undergraduate programs in computing. The funds are being used to cover the
              cost of a four-day workshop to provide the opportunity for the working groups
              associated with CC2001 to engage in face-to-face meetings for the purpose of
              developing the final report. At the conclusion of the workshop, the steering
              committee for CC2001 will put the final report together for approval by the
              IEEE Computer Society and the ACM Executive Council. The final report for
              CC2001 will be published by the IEEE and widely disseminated nationally to all
              computer science departments. It will used as the basis for computer science
              accreditation and curriculum reform.
