Century to millennial scale abrupt changes in
              summer rainfall and winter dust storms in the loess plateau region of China
              have been recorded in the varying grain-size, chemical composition and magnetic
              properties of the wind-borne loess sediments. The investigator will advance the
              current qualitative understanding of the relative variations in paleoclimate of
              China by calibrating the paleo-records from sediments in terms of rainfall and
              temperature variations. From Xining in the north-west to Huanxian in the
              south-east, a three-site transect with known temperature and rainfall
              variations will be sampled as a function of time, back to the last 130,000
              years. These samples will be studied for their grain-size, chemical composition
              and magnetic properties, both in the field and in the laboratory, to establish
              an accurate paleoclimate record.
