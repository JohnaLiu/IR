Theorists in behavioral ecology assume that the
              genetic fitness of an individual can be changed by different strategies.  This
              dissertation research project by a cultural anthropologist from the University
              of Washington will test hypotheses about parental investment theory with data
              on mother-child interactions from a rural society in Sumatra, Indonesia.  The
              project will record data on interbirth intervals and breastfeeding behavior of
              two samples of mothers, one from a relatively well-off and one from a
              relatively less well off village, through an intensive interview with 200
              mothers in each village. Data will also come from behavioral observations of
              infant behavior, breastfeeding and other interactions done through scan
              sampling. This data will allow the student to test predictions drawn from
              theory such as the hypothesis that poor maternal socioeconomic contexts will
              favor long interbirth intervals; that good maternal socioeconomic conditions
              will favor less demanding offspring and less attentive parents. The data from
              this project will allow extensive theory development through hypothesis
              testing, which should advance our understanding of human parenting behavior. 
              In addition the project will advance our knowledge about this important region
              of the world and contribute to the training of a young social scientist.
