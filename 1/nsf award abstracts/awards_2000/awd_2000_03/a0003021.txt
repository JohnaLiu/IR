Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks support for a study of millennial scale climate events
              during marine isotope Stage 3 (~25 to 65 ka) from data in a depth transect of
              cores from the Blake-Bahama Outer Ridges. The project has two main objectives:
              (1) to test models of paleohydrographic change for Stage 3 events by making
              depth profiles in a limited geographic area, and (2) to investigate evidence
              for decade to century scale climate change in a Stage 3 time series from the
              Bermuda Rise. The first objective will test the model that massive discharges
              of icebergs, known as Heinrich events reduced production of both shallow and
              deep components of North Atlantic Deep Water, whereas more typical stadial
              events suppressed only the deep component.  The second objective will
              investigate evidence for high-frequency oxygen isotopic oscillations in
              planktonic foraminifer from the Bermuda Rise.  To put these results in a
              climatic context, we will develop the best possible age model for Stage 3 in
              the open ocean, and compare our new data to both existing alkenone-based
              temperature series and geochemical proxies for deep ocean ventilation
              changes.
