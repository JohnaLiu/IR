Abstract    :
              Established in 1970, California MESA currently offers an array of academic
              support and enrichment services to 24,400 mostly underrepresented students. One
              of MESA's pre-college initiatives uses culture-based mathematics activities to
              reach hundreds of American Indian students in remote rural areas. MESA's
              community college program offers tutoring and collaborative group learning to
              help underrepresented minority science and mathematics majors successfully
              transfer to four-year institutions.  In 1999, 244 MESA community college
              students transferred to four-year universities.  At the undergraduate level,
              MESA supports engineering and computer science majors through scholarships,
              internship opportunities, tutoring and group study.  Over 12% of the nation's
              underrepresented engineering baccalaureate recipients are MESA graduates.
