This project studies the immigrant
              experience of Asian Indian, Nigerian, Vietnamese, Salvadoran and Mexican
              immigrants who have established communities in the sunbelt metropolitan area of
              Dallas, Tarrant, Collin and Denton counties, Texas, since 1980.  The
              researchers, including cultural anthropologists, political scientists,
              historians and demographers, will document incorporation outcomes for each
              immigrant group, paying attention to variation by gender, economic status and
              activity, language use and social mobility, community institutions, intra- and
              inter-group relations and leisure time activity as well as civil and political
              incorporation through naturalization and political participation.  The project
              will analyze the effects of variation in human and social capital such as
              education and social networks and variation in the auspices of immigration such
              as the conditions of arrival (the existence of family contacts, varieties of
              legal or unauthorized status) on the process of incorporation among these
              diverse immigrant populations and individuals.  The project will collect
              qualitative and quantitative data including a demographic analysis of census
              data from the past 30 years, historical archives, in-depth unstructured and
              semi-structured interviews with government officials, heads of organizations,
              employers and immigrant entrepreneurs, a survey of households from each of the
              five immigrant groups, participant-observation, and a telephone survey of
              metroplex residents.  This research will advance theory in modes of
              incorporation, globalization, and transnational research.  The new knowledge to
              be gained will be useful to students of international migration and ethnicity,
              planners, decision makers, and social service deliverers.
