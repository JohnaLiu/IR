This project is an experimental study of solar radiation
              processes near the surface at Dome C, the French-Italian station in East
              Antarctica.  It will be carried out in cooperation with the Labortatoire de
              Glaciologie et Geophysique de l'Environment in Grenoble, France.  The emphasis
              will be on the reflection of sunlight by snow, and the transmission of sunlight
              through clouds.  The observations will have relevance to climate, remote
              sensing, and the physics of ice and snow. 

Both spectral (narrow-band) and
              broadhead transmissions of solar radiation through clouds will be measured, and
              these measurements will be used to obtain effective cloud optical depths for
              use in estimating cloud radiative forcing with applications in climate models. 
              A method to obtain this information from pyranometers alone will be developed
              so that the historical record of solar radiation observations in the antarctic
              interior can be analyzed for climatological information on
              clouds.

Observations of the angular pattern of solar radiation reflected
              from the snow surface will allow the validation of satellite-derived
              atmospheric profile information.  The measured surface reflection functions
              will be reconciled with the empirical functions obtained from Advanced Vidicon
              High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR) on the NOAA series of polar orbiting
              satellites by radiative transfer modeling through the atmosphere.  

Finally,
              the spectral peak of snow albedo will be accurately located in order to resolve
              a discrepancy concerning the spectral absorption of pure ice in the visible to
              near-ultraviolet range.
