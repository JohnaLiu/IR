Abstract    :
              The National Institute of General Medical Sciences, in cooperation with the
              National Human Genome Research Institute, the National Institute of
              Environmental Health Sciences, the Fogarty International Center, and the
              National Science Foundation, is sponsoring a meeting in Bethesda on September
              25-26, 2000, entitled "Community Consultation for the Responsible Collection
              and Use of Samples for Genetic Research."  

The planned community
              consultation in September will bring together individuals from a broad range of
              ethnic and racial groups to provide input on the concept of oversight groups,
              or to propose alternative mechanisms by which protection can be afforded.  It
              is hoped, in addition, that this meeting will begin a process of educating and
              sensitizing the scientific community about issues related to genetic research
              involving identified populations.  We expect approximately 60-70 attendees from
              outside government agencies.
