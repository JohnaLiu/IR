Abstract    :
              A two-part interdisciplinary workshop will be held in Alaska in conjunction with
              a field course offered through the Circumpolar Arctic Social Science Ph.D.
              Network.  The field course will involve 18 Ph.D. students from the eight arctic
              countries and six senior faculty from major circumpolar universities.  The
              first part of the workshop and field course will focus on northern communities
              and global change.  Speakers will include scientists, educators, and Alaska
              Native and community leaders.  The second part will provide an opportunity for
              international participants to learn from Athabascan elders about local
              indigenous cultures and ethical issues of conducting research in the arctic.
              The second part of the workshop and field course will be held at the Old Minto
              Cultural Heritage Camp on the Tanana River.
