Abstract    :
              The present study, which continues a postdoctoral research project into the
              third year, investigates the parental socialization of African-American
              children, their social behavior and the social judgments of African-American
              children and early adolescents. There are two studies associated with this
              project. The first study investigates the relationship between parental
              socialization, behavioral observation and African-American first and
              fourth-grade children's disposition, liking/disliking, moral and reward
              judgments. The second study investigates the disposition, liking/disliking,
              moral and cross-situational judgments of African-American preschool, second-,
              fifth- -and eighth-graders' regarding hypothetical black boy and girl actors
              engaged in prosocial and aggressive behavior. Most of the child interviews for
              both parts of the project and behavioral observation will be conducted by July
              2000. The third year will involve parent interviews, data coding and data
              analyses. The Fellow anticipates that these activities will be completed by
              January, 2001.
