This project is a continuation of the Principal
              Investigator's study of the growth and progression of a continent-scale, active
              compressional orogen, namely the Eastern Tibetan Plateau.  The overarching goal
              of the research is to understand the kinematics and dynamics of plateau
              formation and continental deformation.  Specifically, the research seeks to
              answer questions fundamental to crustal deformation in Eastern Tibet:  the
              structure of the crust and upper mantle; the active strain field; the
              accomodation of strike-slip deformation; the relationship of deformation to
              India-Asia convergence; and the pattern and timing of plateau uplift.  Research
              tasks include; geologic and geodetic field studies, passive source seismology,
              geomorphic studies, geochronologic studies, and theoretical and modeling
              studies of crust/mantle deformation.
