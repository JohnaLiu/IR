The proposed work is an attempt to use a modified version of
              the Princeton Ocean Model (a widely-used numerical model of the ocean developed
              by the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory) to characterize the vertical
              structure of tides in the Ross Sea and the Weddell Sea, and to separate the
              barotropic and baroclinic components.  The barotropic tide is uniform from the
              ocean surface to the bottom, and influences mixing in the water column, benthic
              dissipation of momentum, and the formation of leads in sea ice.  The baroclinic
              tide varies with depth, and introduces internal waves, benthic jet formation,
              and can intensify surface divergence.  Currently little is known about the
              vertical structure of antarctic tidal dynamics and their influence continental
              shelf and slope processes.  The focus of this project will be on the
              semi-diurnal tides, with the expected result a new understanding of generation
              regions for internal tides, regions of increased benthic velocities and shear,
              surface divergence, and tidal mixing through the water column.
