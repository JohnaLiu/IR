Abstract    :
              Three regional higher education organizations, the New England Board of Higher
              Education, Southern Regional Education Board, and Western Interstate Commission
              for Higher Education comprise the Compact for Faculty Diversity, an initiative
              launched in 1993 to address the underrepresentation of minorities in the
              professoriate.  The Compact formed partnerships with state higher education
              agencies and public and private universities, to offer minority doctoral
              students a package of academic and financial support that helps assure their
              successful completion of their doctoral degree programs and transition into
              faculty careers.  By the end of 1999, the Compact had served 435 scholars of
              which 85 had completed their degree programs and 313 remained enrolled and in
              process.  The Compact has a retention rate of 93%, nearly twice that of most
              doctoral granting science, mathematics and engineering programs.  This
              remarkable accomplishment is largely attributable to the quality of mentoring
              provided.
