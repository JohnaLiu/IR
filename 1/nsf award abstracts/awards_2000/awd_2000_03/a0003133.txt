Abstract    :
              The investigators will provide opportunities for undergraduate students to be
              active participants in solar physics related research in the Laboratory for
              Astronomy and Space Physics (LASP) at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The
              main effort is to organize and supervise a summer internship program at
              Goddard. Each year the investigators will recruit students, beginning in
              August, for the following year's program. During the months of April and May,
              the investigators will match the student applicants with mentors and projects
              available at Goddard. Students will begin to arrive for their twelve-week
              internships around mid-May. The ten-week period beginning with Memorial Day
              comprises the core of the program.
