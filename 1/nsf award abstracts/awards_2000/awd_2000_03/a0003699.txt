Abstract    :
              Caldwell/00-03699
This award provides renewed funding for a program called
              "Native Americans in Marine Science" or NAMS. The program recruits Native
              American and Native Alaskan students for undergraduate programs at the
              University of Oregon. The long-term goal of this program is to increase the
              number of minority students who complete degrees in science, continue their
              studies in graduate school, and enter the scientific work force. The program
              was initiated in 1991 and has provided the financial support and mentoring
              necessary for 87 students to continue their higher education and gain research
              experience. The program has a student retention rate of 97%, which is
              remarkable for Native Americans in college. The award provides funding to
              support 20 students each year for the next five years. The program provides the
              students with the financial support necessary to remain in school, but also
              with the networking, mentors, and emotional support necessary to sustain
              minority students who have no family history of higher education.
