	This project is a study of the seasonal variability and
              long term change of the upper ocean structure of the Drake Passage.   It
              consists of high density sections obtained on each crossing by the U.S.
              Antarctic Program's research vessel Laurence M. Gould, using expendable
              bathythermographs, supplemented by expendable conductivity-temperature-depth
              probes.
	This information will lead to the establishment of a high quality
              data base with which to study the magnitude and depth of penetration of the
              seasonal signals, connections to atmospheric forcing, and the effects of
              interannual variations such as those associated with the Antarctic Circumpolar
              Wave. 
	These sections will supplement the approximately twenty sections have
              been obtained since September 1996.  The probes are launched by the scientific
              shipboard personnel on each cruise.  The continuing data analysis is carried
              out in cooperation with the Argentine Antarctic Institute in Buenos
              Aires.
