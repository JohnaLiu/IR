Abstract    :
              The proposal is focused on developing an enabling generic technology to make
              MEMS devices compatible with biological fluids.  The specific goal is to use
              surface modification and analysis strategies to understand protein interactions
              with the surfaces of modified and unmodified devices under flow and static
              conditions, and to be able to eventually make any material used for MEMS
              fabrication biocompatible.  We will investigate the adsorption of differently
              charged proteins on specific surfaces in a variety of channel geometries and at
              different flow rates.  We will examine not only surface modifications that
              resist protein adsorption, but also modifications that impede denaturization,
              as protein resistance is not the same as prevention of protein denaturization. 
              The ultimate goal will be the eventual incorporation of a protein(s) in a
              stable layer that prevents denaturization and protein buildup modeled on
              capillary systems.  The applications of this work span the range of science and
              technology, and could cause a fundamental change in how the industrial sector
              deals with the issue of biocompatibility.  It also provides educational
              training for students and postdocs in a multidisciplinary area.
