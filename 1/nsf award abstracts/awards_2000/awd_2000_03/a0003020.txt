Though this interagency transfer of funds, both the
              Division's of Environmental Biology, Earth Sciences and NSF is fulfilling its
              responsibilities to share in the establishment of an effective mechanism for
              the broader research community to work with the Office of Naval Research
              through the activities of the H. John Heinz III Center for Science, Economics
              and the Environment.  These activities will help strengthen programs at NSF and
              other federal agencies and they will facilitate efficient and effective use of
              government funds
