This is a project to study the Caribbean-South American
              oblique arc-continent collision zone using various geologic (mapping,
              structure), geochemical (Ar-Ar and U-Pb Geochronology), and seismic (active MCS
              with onshore/offshore recording using OBS instruments, passive array)
              techniques.  There will also be a geodynamic modeling study that, very
              innovatively, includes the dynamics of crust-mantle interaction.  The overall
              goal of the project is to understand further the geometry and chronology of a
              world class, arc-continent accretion event.  Seosmic/geological cross-sections
              are to be derived for several transects across the orogen at different ages of
              collision.  The group of investigators include highly capable seismologists in
              both active and passive seismology, as well as geologists familiar with the
              orogenic developments on land.  The cooperation with Venezuelan scientists and
              students is excellent.
