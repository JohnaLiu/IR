This award supports the participation of American
              scientists in a U.S.-Japan seminar on statistical time series analysis, to be
              held in Kyoto, Japan from June 18-22, 2001.  The co-organizers are professors
              Peter Brockwell of Colorado State University and Professor Yuzo Hosoya of
              Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan.  During the last ten years there has been a
              very rapid development of new theory and methodology in the field of time
              series analysis.  This has been motivated by the need to develop new and more
              realistic models for time series occurring in a variety of applied areas, most
              notably in the rapidly expanding field of financial modeling and in the
              geophysical and biomedical sciences.    

The Seminar will consist of the
              following topics:  1) financial and econometric applications;  2) spatial and
              related processes; and  3) non-linear and non-Gaussian models.  Seminar
              organizers have made a special effort to involve younger researchers and
              graduate students as both participants and observers.  The exchange of ideas
              and data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to
              advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative
              projects.  Dissemination of information on the seminar will be available on the
              World Wide Web.
