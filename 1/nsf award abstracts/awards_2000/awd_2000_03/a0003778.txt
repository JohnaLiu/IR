This U.S.-Brazil award provides support from the Division of
              International Programs for a cooperative research between Dr. George Vourlitis,
              California State University, San Marcos, and Dr. Nicolau Priante Filho at
              Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso, in Cuiaba, Brazil.  They will study the
              land use implications on the net ecosystem production and energy balance of
              tropical forest ecosystem.
This project will build upon an existing
              collaboration between the two institutions to measure the net ecosystem
              production (NEP) of Amazonian tropical transitional forest. NEP is the forest
              assimilation of atmospheric CO2 through gross primary production minus
              ecosystem CO2 loss to the atmosphere by plant and soil respiration.  They have
              been measuring the NEP of Brazilian cerradao (the tropical seasonal forest) and
              will now add the measurement of cattle pasture, which is the dominant form of
              land cover change in southern Amazonia.  There is an urgent need to understand
              the role of tropical terrestrial ecosystems in the global CO2 balance.  This
              research will fill in a gap in our understanding of tropical ecosystem carbon
              cycling.  The PIs will measure the NEP of mature, intact cerradao and cattle
              pasture of northern Mato Grosso.  They will then link measurements of NEP and
              microclimate to a process-based model to assess the implications of land cover
              change on the seasonal and interannual rates and patterns of NEP.
Besides the
              benefit to this area of research, this project will include the training of
              young researchers on both sides, exposing them to new research methods and
              technology.
