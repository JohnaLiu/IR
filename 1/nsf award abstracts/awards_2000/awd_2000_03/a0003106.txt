Abstract    :
              In 1992, Dr. Spaht established the Louisiana Preparatory Program (LaPREP), an
              enrichment program for high-ability middle school students.  The purpose of
              LaPREP is to motivate and instruct its participants to pursue college studies
              in science, mathematics, and engineering.  LaPREP begins its ninth session in
              June 2000 - six hours a day, seven weeks per summer.  Each year, 30 sixth and
              seventh grade students are selected as first-year participants.  Successful
              first-year students are invited to return for a second year. Laboratory
              experience, including hands-on academic research activities, is an integral
              part of LaPREP in that it introduces mathematics and science as active and
              participatory processes.  
Dr. Spaht addresses every aspect of the program,
              including curriculum development, mentoring, training program staff, recruiting
              participants, and raising funds.  More than 225 students have completed at
              least one year of LaPREP.  All former participants who have graduated from high
              school have enrolled in college with over 90% majoring in science, mathematics
              or engineering.  Dr. Spaht is presently a member of the faculty of Louisiana
              State University, Shreveport.
