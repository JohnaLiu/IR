Abstract    :
              The investigators will study plasma structure, dynamics, and coupling resulting
              from the interaction of an inverted-V structure and a typical polar wind plasma
              during its transit through the auroral region.  An important objective in
              ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling is to trace the flow of mass, energy, and
              momentum, on both small and large scales.  In the auroral region, this coupling
              can be affected by the interaction of thermal and auroral plasmas, which can
              lead to plasma energization, and multi-scale plasma structures.  A persistent
              signature in the auroral regions is an inverted-V structure in the
              precipitating electron spectral distribution.  The interaction of the
              convecting polar wind with the inverted-V structures is likely to result in
              dramatic departures of the polar wind plasma transport properties, which are a
              key factor in defining ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling.  The study will be
              based on a generalized, time-dependent, 16-moment, multi-species, multi-scale,
              field-aligned transport model capable of simulating mesoscale plasma outflow
              processes.  The model will be used to quantify the role of an inverted-V
              structure in mesoscale plasma dynamics, plasma energization, density
              structures, and ionospheric plasma outflow.  The model results will help to
              understand the most important physical processes influencing
              magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.
