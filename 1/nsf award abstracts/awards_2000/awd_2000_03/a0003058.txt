This US-Mexico award will fund a collaborative project
              between Dr. Rodney M. Feldmann, Kent State University, Ohio, in collaboration
              with Dr. Francisco J. Vega, National Autonomous University of Mexico.  The
              researchers aim to study the Cenozoic paleographic history of Mexico and to
              consider the implications of this history for the evolution and geographic
              dispersal of fossil decapod crustaceans (shrimps, crabs, and lobsters) and
              molluscs.  

The areas to be studied, in the states of Chiapas and Baja
              California Sur, lie within the southern and Central American region that served
              both as a barrier to, and an avenue for, dispersal of marine organisms during
              the Tertiary, and therefore represent a crucial link in the paleobiogeographic
              story of decapods.   The dispersal routes of these organisms are most likely to
              have crossed Mexico and Central America; however, the fossil record from this
              region is currently not adequate to test this hypothesis.  It is anticipated
              that the proposed field research will make it possible to resolve and describe
              the routes of dispersal of decapods, compare those patterns with the patterns
              of dispersal of molluscs, and provide a basis for evaluating general statements
              about dispersal histories of other groups of marine organisms.
