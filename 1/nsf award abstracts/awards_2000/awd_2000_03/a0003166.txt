              Abstract for Roesler 0003166

 This award would support analysis and
              additional measurements of the spectral profile of the geocoronal Balmer
              emission at 656.1 nm that would be obtained for data obtained in the period
              between solar minimum and solar maximum by the Wisconsin  H-alpha mapper (WHAM)
              operating at Kitt Peak, AZ.  These results would be combined with modeling of
              Bishop that is represented by the global atomic resonance radiation transport
              modeling code.  These results would enable the extension of the current WHAM
              data base from a few case studies to a much more comprehensive database.  These
              results would make possible public access to the WHAM web-based database of
              geocoronal column-integrated Balmer-alpha intensities.
