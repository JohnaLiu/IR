The goal of this project is to investigate
              how the injection of mafic magma into a shallow silicic magma chamber affects
              the chemical and isotopic composition of rocks preserved in granite plutons. 
              The Vinalhaven pluton is an ideal setting for this study because mafic input to
              a silicic magma chamber is well preserved in feeders and as layered deposits of
              mafic and hybrid intermediate to silicic rocks.  These rocks provide a spatial
              and temporal framework that will permit us to evaluate the petrographic,
              geochemical, and isotopic signature of hybridization both proximal and distal
              to the point of entry of the individual mafic replenishments, as well as in the
              overlying "homogeneous" granite.  Our work will focus on intragrain trace
              element and isotopic variations through microanalysis of selected minerals,
              using laser ablation ICPMS and ID-TIMS. We will also employ high-precision U-Pb
              geochronology to constrain the active lifetime of the Vinalhaven magma chamber
              and attempt to link the preserved magmatic record to the preserved eruptive
              record of genetically related volcanic rocks. In the first year, this project
              will incorporate a Keck Geology Consortium Project with nine undergraduates who
              will undertake 4 weeks of field work.  This research bears directly on the
              origin and emplacement of granite. We believe that studies of mineral zoning
              are likely to show that adjacent crystals have very different histories of
              crystallization.  This information, combined with the common isotopic
              variability of a granite and field evidence for multiple replenishments of
              diverse magmas, strongly suggests that the bulk chemical and isotopic
              compositions of granite are neither the records of a single magma source nor
              equivalent to volcanic liquids erupted from the chamber.
