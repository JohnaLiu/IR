Abstract    :
              The investigators will measure and study the atmospheric gravity wave structure
              and flux into the mesosphere at Maui.  The structure observed in OH airglow
              imagery will be used to calculate the vertical flux of horizontal momentum
              carried by gravity waves with large vertical wavelengths.  The instrument to be
              used consists of a broadband, single filter, OH imager with the large light
              gathering power.  Airglow imagers are uniquely capable of measuring gravity
              waves with large phase speeds that carry the major portion of the wave momentum
              flux in the mesosphere.  The airglow measurements will be combined with wind
              measurements from a lidar and meteor radar collocated at the Maui site.  A
              secondary objective is to make measurements of, and study the sign of, the
              vertical direction these short horizontal scale waves are propagating.  Upward
              propagating momentum may be cancelled by downward propagating waves.  These
              observations will contribute information useful for the study of energy
              deposition by gravity waves and their effects on global change processes.
