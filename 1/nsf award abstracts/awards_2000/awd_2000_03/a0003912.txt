This dissertation research examines social
              relations of livestock trade in northern Kenya.  The project, by a cultural
              anthropologist from the University of Kentucky, explores how trust operates in
              the context of economic, environmental and other uncertainties. The role of
              differential information in trust relationships among traders of different
              ethnicity, in different types of market trade, and in different sorts of
              transactions will be studied. The study will focus on livestock markets and
              will collect both qualitative ethnographic (participant observation, in-depth
              interviews, case histories) and quantitative survey data of trader households
              to analyze the complex nature of trader relationships.  Hypotheses relating
              differences in information, type of stock traded, ethnicity, and forms of
              relationship will be tested. The new data to be generated will advance the
              theory of personalized economic relationships, will increase our knowledge
              about this important region of the world, and will help train a young social
              scientist. The information will also be important for policy makers and
              planners of arid land and pastoral economic systems.
