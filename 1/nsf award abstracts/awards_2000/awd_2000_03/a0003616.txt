This award supports a one-year study of the floating part of
              Byrd Glacier, from its grounding line located halfway up a fjord through the
              Transantarctic Mountains to the end of its lateral rift zone on the Ross Ice
              Shelf beyond the  fjord.  Over this l00 km distance, the side boundary changes
              from rigid between the fjord sidewalls, to nearly free in the lateral rift
              zone, to deforming when the rifts are healed and Bryd Glacier becomes fully
              coupled to the Ross Ice Shelf.  The stress field for these changing conditions
              will be calculated a using a gridpoint finite-element  model for the Ross Ice
              Shelf (Thomas and MacAyeal, l982) and a flowband finite-difference model for
              smooth transitions from sheet flow to stream flow to shelf flow  (Hughes,
              l998).  Results of the two modeling approaches will be compared, using existing
              ice elevation and velocity data obtained from aerial photogrammetry, our
              unpublished surface mass balance data, and new  velocity data obtained from
              Landsat imagery by the U. S. Geological Survey. This study will train one
              graduate  student at the Masters level.
