Theoretical considerations and modeling results
              suggest a relationship between geomagnetic field intensity and polarity
              reversal rate. No clear relationship, however, is apparent in available
              paleointensity data. The investigators address this issue using a new
              paleointensity measurement approach that uses analyses of single plagioclase
              crystals. These crystals, which contain magnetic inclusions that retain
              paleofield values, are less susceptible to alteration during paleointensity
              experiments than some whole rock samples. Results from Thellier-Thellier
              experiments on plagioclase crystals separated from basalts that formed during
              the Cretaceous Normal Polarity Superchron (Rajmahal Traps) suggest a
              time-averaged paleomagnetic dipole moment three times that thought to have
              typified times of frequent geomagnetic reversals in the Cenozoic and early
              Cretaceous/late Jurassic. This result leads to their hypothesis that there is a
              correlation between times of low reversal frequency and high geomagnetic field
              strength. They propose to test this hypothesis through a study of high- and
              low-latitude mid-Cretaceous flood basalt sites. These rocks will allow the
              investigators to examine the spatial (latitudinal) and temporal variation of
              geomagnetic field intensity during the Cretaceous Normal Polarity Superchron.
