Abstract    :
              Under this award, Dr. Frank will develop a climatology of tropical waves by
              combining diagnostic analyses of satellite-derived data sets with global
              weather analysis fields.  The study will focus on waves with periods of 3-15
              days, principally mixed Rossby-gravity waves, equatorial Rossby waves, and
              synoptic-scale easterly waves.  A novel aspect of the study will be the use of
              precipitable water data, obtained from the NASA Water Vapor Project (NVAP), as
              the primary tool for identifying and tracking waves.  This data set should
              permit identification of waves in convectively inactive regions of the tropics
              and complements the use of outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) for the
              convectively active regions in the tropics.  The study will make use of 10
              years of NVAP precipitable water data, OLR data, and global analysis fields
              from the European Center for Medium Range Forecasts.
