Abstract    :
              Grimes (1992) estimates that there are approximately 6000 languages spoken in
              the world today. LaPolla (1998) and Grimes have run statistical analyses based
              upon census and population estimate figures that show an alarming number of
              these, perhaps as many as 50%, are in real danger of extinction. Fifty-two
              percent of the world's languages are spoken regularly by less than 10,000
              people, 28% are spoken by less than 1,000 and 10% by less than 100 (LaPolla
              1998). By contrast, 49% of the world's population speaks one of 10 major
              languages (Mandarin, English, Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese, Bengali, Russian,
              Japanese, French, German) as their mother tongue.

Linguists have a twofold
              reason to be concerned about this trend in rapid language loss. First, and most
              importantly, the death of a language or dialect represents a significant loss
              in culture. Language serves a unique purpose as the primary means of cultural
              preservation and cross-generational cultural transmission. The death of a
              culture's language represents a serious impediment to the survival of that
              community. Second, the death of a language or dialect represents a serious
              academic loss (Hale 1996, Woodbuty 1993). Studies of linguistic diversity and
              cross linguistic comparisons drive much of linguistic theory. Many (if not
              most) of the endangered languages have not been well studied or documented.
              When such a language disappears, then, there are two losses: a loss of valuable
              linguistic data, and the loss of the culture it represents.

As the largest
              electronic linguistics publication in the world (http://www.linguistlist.org),
              the LINGUIST List would like to preserve data on minority and endangered
              languages in a widely-available electronic repository. The repository is a
              long-term project, which will require substantial funding and partnership with
              other institutions. But in order to lay the groundwork for this enterprise,
              preliminary research on database architecture must be done immediately. This
              Small Grant for Exploratory research will fund the design of an innovative,
              extensible database and support a pilot project to test the design using data
              from two disparate languages: Biao Min, a Hmong-Mien language with a complex
              phonology, and Mocovi, a Waikurean language with a complex morphology.
