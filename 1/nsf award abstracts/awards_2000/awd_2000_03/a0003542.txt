The Galapagos shield volcanoes on the islands of
              Fernandina and Isabela are among the most active volcanoes on Earth with an
              average of 2-3 eruptions every 10 years. The investigator's previous radar
              interferometric study demonstrated how actively the Galapagos volcanoes deform,
              and how well this can be measured with radar interferometry. All but one of the
              7 volcanoes show evidence for magma intrusion resulting in uplift of the
              volcanic edifice at rates between a few mm/yr to 0.9 m/yr (Amelung et al.,
              2000). In this project the investigators will obtain a dense time series of
              interferograms to map, document and interpret the deformation of Galapagos
              volcanoes with high temporal resolution (~35-70 days). A dense time series of
              interferograms will address the following issues: Do subsurface magmatic
              intrusions occur in pulses or are they continuous in time? If in pulses, how
              long do they last? Does the intrusion rate increase prior to an eruption? Is
              the center of magmatic inflation stationary or does it migrate vertically or
              horizontally prior to an eruption? Do intrusions at different volcanoes occur
              simultaneously or are they separated in time? Are the volcanoes fed by a common
              or by different deep magma sources? These questions should be addressed by the
              dense spatial and time coverage the proposed InSAR observations.
