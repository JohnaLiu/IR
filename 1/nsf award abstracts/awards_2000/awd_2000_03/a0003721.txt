This award supports Fu-Tong Liu and students from the La Jolla
              Institute for Allergy and Immunology in a collaboration with Hans-Joachim
              Gabius of the Department of Physiology at the University of Munich, Germany. 
              The research focus is on the analysis of the recognition of glycans by their
              receptors, such as Galectin.  Galectin, only recently described, has been shown
              to be involved in fundamental biological processes such as growth control, cell
              adhesion, and cell migration.  In order to understand the functions or the
              galectin family, it is necessary to understand the structures of the proteins
              and to deign galectin-type-specific inhibitors to interfere with the activity
              of a certain galectin. This international collaboration will employ
              complementary expertise and facilities, since the U.S. side has extensive
              experience in molecular cloning of recombinant galectins and development of
              mice with targeted deletion of a specific galectin, and the German group has
              developed experience in a variety of physicochemical measurements.  This joint
              collaborative research effort also presents junior researchers with the
              opportunity to work internationally, and the work done on this proposal will
              help institutionalize the relationship between the German and U.S. research
              groups.
