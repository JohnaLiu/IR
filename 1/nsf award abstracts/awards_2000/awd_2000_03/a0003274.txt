This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              involves a US team led by Yousef Saad at the University of Minnesota and French
              team led by Bernard Philippe of French National Institute for Research in
              Informatics and Applied Mathematics (INRIA) at Rennes, France.  Other
              participants include Randall Branley, University of Indiana, Maria Sosonkina,
              University of Minnesota, and Esmond Ng, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.  The
              French team is multi-institutional with researchers from INRIA's campuses in
              Lyon and Toulouse, from the CNRS and from IFREMER (the French public
              organization for research on the sea).  The project addresses parallel
              iterative methods for solving large scale engineering and scientific problems
              on high performance computers.  Many scientific and engineering applications
              give rise to very large linear systems that are ill-conditioned, and often
              highly indefinite.  Existing iterative parallel algorithms developed for
              solution of large linear systems rarely take these characteristics into
              account, and as a result they often fail to converge.  The project will explore
              new direct  and iterative methods as a means for developing memory efficient
              and cost effective solutions for very large linear systems on high performance
              computers.

This award represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF
              and the French National Institute for Research in Informatics and Applied
              Mathematics (INRIA).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the
              US investigators.  INRIA will support the visits of French researchers to the
              United States.   The project takes advantage of complementary expertise in
              solvers in parallel computing.  The methods will be applied to problems in
              geophysical prospecting and in electronic materials.
