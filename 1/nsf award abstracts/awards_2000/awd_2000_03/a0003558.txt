This collaborative study will document the
              evolution of a nascent subduction zone along the Fiordland margin of southwest
              New Zealand with the objective of constraining the dynamics of subduction
              initiation. Using the finite element method, the investigators will model the
              history of vertical motion and gravity in order to determine the classes of
              dynamic models most consistent with the uplift history and modern structure of
              the region. (U-Th)/He dating by the investigators and exposure dating by New
              Zealand collaborators will place limits on erosional denudation associated with
              bedrock uplift. During year 1, the team will obtain helium ages for previously
              collected bedrock samples. During the Austral summer (year 2), they will
              collect new samples along the coast of the southernmost fiords with a chartered
              boat and at high elevations with a helicopter. Helium thermochronometric ages
              for these samples will be used to test the dynamic models. This is a
              collaborative project with NZ colleagues R. Sutherland (IGNS) and P. Kamp
              (Waikato University) who have complementary funding from the Royal Society of
              NZ.
