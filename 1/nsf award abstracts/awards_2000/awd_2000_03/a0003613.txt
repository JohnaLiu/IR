Abstract    :
              "The Great Lakes Story" is a 3,000 sq. ft. interactive traveling exhibit based
              on the highly successful and unique permanent exhibition at the Great Lakes
              Science Center.  Its focus is devoted to highlighting the natural history of
              the Great Lakes ecosystem.  The traveling exhibit will allow even more visitors
              around the country to understand the beauty, majesty and restoration efforts of
              this important national resource.  Through a planned six-year tour, it is
              estimated "The Great Lakes Story" will be experienced by as many as three
              million people.

There will be several components, including hands-on
              exhibits, organized with a centerpiece of a walk-around model of the Great
              Lakes region, and other interactive components.  The four major areas of the
              exhibit are physical characteristics of the Lakes, the natural cycles and
              processes which shaped them over time, changes and threats to the Lakes
              (especially human-induced), and finally, restoration efforts to bring the Lakes
              back to being the rich and productive ecosystem they should be.  Along with
              these exhibit areas, other project components are educational and marketing
              materials to ensure that host science centers are able to provide a complete
              learning experience to their youth, family, and adult audiences around the
              country.
