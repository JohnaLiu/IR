This project aims to link the revolutionary new National
              Advanced Driving Simulator (NADS), located at the University of Iowa, with the
              Virtual Reality Applications Center (VRAC), located at Iowa State University,
              through the existing Iowa Communications Network (ICN).  The two universities
              us the ICN as part of their participation in the NSF very high speed Backbone
              Network Service (vBNS) and related Internet II activity.  Both facilities
              cooperate with Deere & Company which strongly supports the project and will
              provide industrial-quality test problems and support in the form of personnel
              that will participate in the design process and assist with demonstrations. 
              Challenges and benefits of linking these facilities will be investigated
              through two demonstrations.  The first will use two operator-in-the-loop
              simulators.  The second demonstration will focus on an "engineering
              tele-presence" application.
