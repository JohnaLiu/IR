Abstract    :
              The investigators will attempt to distinguish the origins of fast and slow solar
              wind. The main effort is to study several properties of the solar corona at two
              forthcoming total solar eclipses. The investigators will make simultaneous
              K-corona, Fe X, XI, XIII and XIV intensity imagery, spectroscopic imaging in Fe
              XIV, and polarimetric imaging in Fe XIII and XIV. From these, they will deduce
              electron density, temperature, line-of-sight velocity, abundance of Fe+12 and
              Fe+13 ions, and the "sky plane" projection of the magnetic field direction. It
              is widely accepted that slow wind comes from areas of the corona with closed
              magnetic fields, and fast wind from regions with open magnetic fields, but this
              is a classification rather than an understanding. Physical understanding can
              only come from knowledge of the plasma parameters in the different source
              regions. The investigators note that discrepancies among current observational
              techniques currently prevent unambiguous determination of these parameters.
              Their new measurements of electron density and temperature represent an attempt
              to resolve these discrepancies.
