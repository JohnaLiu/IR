This Pan-American Advanced Institutes award, jointly
              supported by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will consist of a
              series of lectures and research interactions on the production of new states of
              matter in hadronic interactions at high energy and/or temperatures.  The course
              will be held in Sao Paulo, Brazil in the early months of 2002 and will involve
              approximately 40 graduate students in a two-week presentation of introductory
              material and current research results in this rapidly developing field.  It
              will also include approximately 10 primary lecturers to present the basic
              material with additional researchers giving seminars on specialized research
              results. The main goal is to allow advanced graduate students to specialize in
              this interdisciplinary activity, which brings together physicists from
              previously separated subfields of high-energy particle physics and nuclear
              physics.  Publication of the proceedings containing the lectures and seminars
              will produce a useful reference work for the research community, and serve as a
              resource tool for the students as they advance in their careers. The
              interactions among students and researchers should be also helpful in laying
              the groundwork for future collaborations.
