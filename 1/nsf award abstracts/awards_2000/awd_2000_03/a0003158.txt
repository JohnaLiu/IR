Abstract    :
              Adolescent and adult African American English (AAE) is characterized by
              well-defined syntactic and semantic forms. However, the stages of development
              in which child AAE speakers acquire these patterns have not been identified. As
              a result, thorough descriptions of the speech of normally developing AAE
              speakers are not available, though some researchers have considered the use of
              a particular feature in the language of five and six year old AAE speakers
              (Stockman and Vaughn-Cook 1981; Wyatt 1991, 1995; Jackson 1995). 

The
              planning activities are designed to lead to the development of a protocol,
              including elicitation tasks, that will be used in gathering information to
              write a descriptive analysis of the syntactic and semantic patterns in the
              grammars of three, four and five year old AAE speakers in Lake Arthur,
              Louisiana; Austin, Texas; and Dallas, Texas. The research to be conducted
              following the planning activities will provide data about the overall system of
              AAE, with a focus on areas such as tense and aspect marking, the system of
              existential marking, patterns in negation constructions and strategies of
              question formation. By analyzing AAE within a theoretical framework, it becomes
              possible to move beyond discussions in which the variety is compared to
              mainstream English, thus showing how AAE patterns with respect to other
              languages.
