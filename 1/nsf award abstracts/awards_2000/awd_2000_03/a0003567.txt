California Paleo-streamflow records from the Last Interglacial

        The goal of this
              research project is to assess annual average and seasonal salinity and river
              inflow to San Francisco Bay during the Last Interglacial (ca 130 to 115 ka).
              The Bay, located at the mouth of the San Joaquin-Sacramento river system,
              receives river discharge from a drainage basin that integrates precipitation
              and runoff over a watershed covering 40% of California. Previous work shows
              that the Last Interglacial was warmer, with a higher sea level, than the
              present interglacial. This study will examine how these previous changes have
              impacted a major, now highly urbanized, estuary. This will be accomplished by
              isotopic analyses of mollusk shells and foraminifers, as well as stratigraphic
              and paleontological analysis, of estuarine sediments cored in the northern
              reach of San Francisco Bay (near the delta). In this study we hope to provide
              data on the natural variability of average intra-annual inflow during the Last
              Interglacial. We also wish to assess the amplitude and seasonal distribution of
              inflow during this warmer period, in order to predict what affect future global
              warming may have on San Francisco Bay estuarine system.
