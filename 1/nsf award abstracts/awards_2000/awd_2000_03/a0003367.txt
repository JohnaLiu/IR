Whereas many volcanoes erupt magmas of diverse composition
              over a wide range of temperatures, others erupt magmas of nearly identical
              composition over a narrow range of temperature.  One or more magmatic processes
              must buffer the compositions in the latter type of system as the magmas ascend
              through the lithosphere, and determining and quantifying those processes are
              the objectives of this proposal. Because the processes involved in buffering
              cause little variability in whole rock compositions, the main means of the
              study will be electron and ion microprobe analysis of rehomogenized melt
              inclusions. Much of this study, and many others, depends on the presumption
              that melt inclusions reliably reflect the compositional evolution of the magma.
              To test this presumption, a series of experiments has been designed to assess
              the degree that inclusions' compositions are reliable.  Growing crystals change
              the compositions of the liquid in a boundary layer whose thickness depends on
              the diffusivity of the chemical constituents and the growth rate of the
              crystal.  The effect of a compositional boundary layer on the composition of
              melt inclusions will be simulated by creating artificial melt inclusions by
              annealing a pre-fractured crystal in the presence of a melt with which it is in
              equilibrium.  Boundary layers of different thicknesses should be generated by a
              range of cooling rates and different amounts of total cooling.
