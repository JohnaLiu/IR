FLAGG

Barbara Flagg is conducting exploratory research to assess the
              feasibility and viability of presenting to the public an on-going review of new
              findings or issues in major fields of research.  This research on the untested
              idea of providing the public with information about research on a regular,
              on-going basis through multiple media will provide information about the
              American public's current science media habits, their awareness of and interest
              in broad areas of research, and the presentation formats most likely to appeal
              to and reach the public on a regular basis.
