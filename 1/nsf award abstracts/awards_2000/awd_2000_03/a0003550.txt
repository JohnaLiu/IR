GPS measurements in Jamaica, Honduras, and San Andres island
              in the western Caribbean will be undertaken, with two principal goals: (1) To
              improve the still-rudimentary models of present-day Caribbean plate motions to
              a level capable of testing for hypothesized deformation within the interior of
              this narrow plate, and (2) To continue a relatively new study of Jamaican
              neotectonics and seismic hazard in collaboration with Margaret Grandison, the
              director/seismologist of the Jamaican Seismographic Network (JSN). Toward the
              first goal, recently-installed GPS monuments in southern Jamaica and 
Honduras
              will be reoccupied, as will a critical GPS benchmarks on San Andres Island.
              
Improved GPS coverage of the Caribbean plate interior, which presently has
              only one active GPS benchmark in the western 1500 km of the plate interior,
              will significantly improve the accuracy of the weakly over-determined Caribbean
              plate angular velocity and will allow more rigorous tests for measurable
              deformation of the plate interior. Toward the second goal, GPS measurements
              within a recently installed 14-site Jamaican GPS network will be combined with
              seismic results from the JSN to model seismic hazard and neotectonics of this
              poor and densely-populated country, whose two largest cities Kingston and
              Montego Bay are built near faults that have had large historic earthquakes.
              Using seismically-constrained fault locations, fault dips, and earthquake slip
              directions, the investigators will use GPS velocities to solve for bounds on
              the location and magnitude of elastic strain accumulation on the island.
