Abstract    :
              DGE-0003883

The World Wide Web is increasingly becoming an integrated
              extension of users' computing environments, with content indexed and retrieved
              through Web browsers.  Web browsers are increasingly being used as a science
              curriculum delivery mechanism, for both books delivered as local content on CD
              ROMs as well as server-based material.  

Traditional science curriculum has
              often had a static presentation due to having been delivered on printed media. 
              What was printed ahead of time in books or handouts could not be changed.  Any
              changes would have to be attached externally by way of extra handouts or
              explanations on the board.  The Web gives us the technological affordances to
              change that.  

In this work we propose implementing an architecture that
              allows an instructor to modify curriculum as
 it is presented through a web
              browser.  This would allow a teacher to customize web-based curriculum to
 fit
              a particular need.  

For example:
A list of materials could be substituted
              with a different list
Additional examples personalized to the students'
              context could be that
Extra notes and explanations could be added where
              necessary
Cross-reference and supplementary bibliographic information could be
              added.

The original page would remain unchanged, with just the users' view
              of it that would change.  A working prototype of this approach has already been
              implemented through the support in part of PFSMETE funding. Additional work is
              needed to turn it into a tool that is enough to be disseminated.
