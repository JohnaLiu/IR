Abstract    :
              This project is implementing a professional development model created to
              increase the successful participation of community colleges and community
              college faculty in NSF programs. The Council for Resource Development (CRD) is
              building in the project upon existing regional conferences to offer a series of
              three workshops designed to familiarize faculty with NSF programs, showcase
              regional NSF projects and the faculty conducting those projects, and conduct a
              workshop on proposal development strategies specific to NSF. In order the
              achieve the goals, CRD is: (a) providing coordination for workshop development
              and implementation at the regional level; (b) recruiting faculty to attend the
              workshops who have not yet received awards from NSF; and (c) evaluating the
              workshops with particular emphasis on longitudinal outcomes. Evaluation of
              project outcomes includes looking for increased rates of proposal submissions
              to NSF as well as an increase in the success of those submitted.
