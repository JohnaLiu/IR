This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration
              involves Krishnan Rajeshwar and N.R. de Tacconi of the University of Texas at
              Arlington, and Daniel Lincot and colleagues at the Ecole Nationale Superieure
              de Chimie de Paris.  The investigators propose to investigate and conduct joint
              experiments on the mechanics of cathodic electrodeposition of metal oxide films
              using soluble precursor species and the role of solution additives on cathodic
              oxide film growth. The Texas and French groups bring to this collaboration
              complementary expertise in solution chemistry, metal oxide films, and in
              semiconductor film deposition.  The collaboration takes advantage of a cathodic
              technique developed by the French group.

This award represents the U.S. side
              of a joint proposal to NSF and the French National Center for Scientific
              Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the U.S.
              investigators and graduate students.  The CNRS will support the visits of the
              French researchers to the United States. The collaboration will advance
              understanding of the electrosynthesis of metal oxide films and their
              technological applications in optoelectronics, solar cells, electrochromics,
              batteries, and water treatment.
