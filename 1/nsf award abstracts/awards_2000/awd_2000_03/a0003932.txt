Abstract    :
              This one-day workshop will be held currently with the 2000 ASME Design
              Engineering Technical Conference. The goal of this workshop is to bring
              relevant academic, industry, and government experts together, especially
              including those outside of the ASME community, to discuss research challenges
              and establish research goals in the general area of human assist devices and
              automation. The focus will be on task-oriented integration of simple
              mechanisms, controls and intelligence to provide customized flexibility at an
              affordable cost. The potential task scopes range from aiding people with
              disability, microsurgery, health care, industrial automation, material
              handling, manufacturing, construction, combat, tele-operation, to satellite
              deployment. Findings of the workshop will comprise the substance of a public
              report  to the NSF, which is also made available on the web for appropriate
              wider dissemination.
