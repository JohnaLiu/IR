Abstract    :
              The University of New Mexico's MEMS program was established in 1994 to increase
              minority enrollment and graduation levels in science, mathematics and
              engineering.  The program consists of seven core components: (i) a summer
              program that bridges the gap between high school and college; (ii)
              problem-solving workshops for undergraduates; (iii) industry internships; (iv)
              undergraduate research experiences with faculty mentors; (v) professional
              development opportunities for K-12 mathematics and science teachers; (vi) a
              transfer program for community college students; and, (vii) academic enrichment
              opportunities for local high school students. Over the past six years, the MEMS
              program has served almost 1,600 minority science, mathematics and engineering
              undergraduate students. Engineering baccalaureate degrees earned by minority
              students at The University of New Mexico have increased from 20% of the total
              in 1992 to 40% in 1999.
