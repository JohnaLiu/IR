Abstract    :
              This research will generate new methods for studying the behavior of inventories
              and new insights into the causes and propagation mechanism of business cycles. 
              The particular goals are to devlop appropriate framework for applying the
              linear-quadratic inventory model to data that exhibit long-run stochastic
              trends.  We also intend to use this method to study different two-digit
              manufacturing sectors to characterize the response of inventories, production,
              and final sales to an oil price shock.  We will also trace out the
              intersectoral and interremporal linkages that may be involved in propagating
              the shock into an economics recession.  Finally, we plan to re-examine the
              empiricial evidence on the role of monetary policy in accounting for the
              historical correlation between oil price shocks and economic activity.
