Abstract    :
              The University of Iowa is seeking support to acquire equipment for setting up an
              IDD feed to the Iowa Institute of Hydraulic Research (IIHR).  The equipment
              consist of a high-end PC with local storage, CD burner, a DVD-RAM burner, and
              two disks for a Hewlett-Packard file server.  With this equipment, IIHR will be
              able to expand its program in hydrometeorology.  This equipment will bring Iowa
              into the IDD system which provides Level II data that will enhance the
              institution's overall research capability.
