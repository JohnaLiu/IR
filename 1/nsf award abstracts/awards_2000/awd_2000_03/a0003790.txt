This award supports John Davis and a graduate student from the
              University of Kansas in a collaboration with Jan Harff of the Institute for
              Baltic Research in Warnemunde, Germany.  The research funded by this award will
              focus on variations in the properties of sediments from the Baltic Sea floor as
              they reflect variations in climate since the beginning of the last major
              glacial retreat, which occurred 13,000 years ago.  Recent work has demonstrated
              the utility of applying statistical zonation and correlation techniques to
              physical properties of sediment cores from the Baltic floor.  The work on this
              proposal, which will extend the analysis of core samples through the Kattegut
              and Skaggerak and into the North Sea, will elucidate connections between Baltic
              Sea sediment properties and other paleoclimate indicators.  This joint
              collaborative research effort also presents junior researchers with the
              opportunity to work internationally, and the work done on this proposal will
              help institutionalize the relationship between the German and U.S. research
              groups.
