This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in
              chemistry involves Eric A. Maatta of Kansas State University and Pierre Gouzerh
              of the Universite Pierre et Marie Curie.  They will collaborate on studies of
              polyoxometalate clusters, a diverse group of chemical compounds.  Nitrogen
              substituted polyoxometalates will be synthesized and characterized using
              several different techniques: single-crystal X-ray diffraction, cyclic
              voltammetry and polarography, IR, Raman and electronic spectroscopies, and
              multinuclear NMR spectroscopy.   The US investigator brings to this
              collaboration expertise in metal-imido chemistry.  This is complemented by the
              French group's expertise and experience in characterizing polyoxometalates.
              

This award represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the
              French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel
              funds and living expenses for the US investigator and graduate and
              undergraduate students.  CNRS will support the visits of French researchers to
              the United States. The collaboration will advance fundamental understanding of
              a new class of novel materials that have a role in catalysis, medicine and
              magnetics.
