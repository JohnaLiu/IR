We seek to improve the framework for Lu-Hf
              isotopic studies by redetermination of the Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) Lu-Hf and
              Sm-Nd parameters.   At present, the array of mantle and crustal samples appears
              not to contain the BSE point.   This may suggest that a very important early
              differentiation episode is recorded, such that an unseen complementary
              reservoir exists in the mantle, or was perhaps lost in early Solar System
              collisions. It may also suggest that the chondritic reference for Lu-Hf is
              incorrect, or that BSE really differs from chondrites for other reasons.   We
              intend to check the Lu-Hf chondritic parameters by careful analysis of a suite
              of chondritic meteorites.   Sm-Nd characterization will be performed
              simultaneously, with the goal of ensuring comparability between Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd
              systems.   We will also undertake work to better constrain the decay constant
              of 176Lu, employing fresh Precambrian dolerites, to obtain internal isochrons
              and compare ages to those from precise U-Pb dating of baddeleyite or zircon in
              the mafic intrusions.   These investigations should enormously improve the
              conceptual framework for Lu-Hf isotopic study of Earth differentiation
              processes.
