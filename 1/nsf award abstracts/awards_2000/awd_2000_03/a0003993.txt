Abstract    :
              High-Performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research
              (HIAPER) will be a medium sized jet aircraft capable of operating in the upper
              troposphere to lower stratosphere, highly modified to carry a substantial
              scientific research payload.  It will be capable of transporting observational
              scientists over greater rantes and for longer duration than has previously been
              possible.  HIAPER will be designed to serve a broad cross-section of the
              geosciences community and will fill a major gap in the current U.S. airborne
              research fleet.
