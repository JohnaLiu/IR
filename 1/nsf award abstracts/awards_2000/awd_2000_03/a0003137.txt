Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to study products of the atmospheric oxidation
              of isoprene, in particular, hydroxy carbonyl compounds. A method to quantify
              these compounds based on scrubbing, derivatization with PFBHA and BSTFA, and
              gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometery, will be further developed. For
              the purpose of preparing standards, a variety of compounds will be synthesized.
              The procedure will then be demonstrated for field measurements and deployed at
              field sites in Northern California
