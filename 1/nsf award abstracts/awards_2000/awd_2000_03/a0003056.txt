Conference support: Sustainability of wetlands and water
              resources: How well can riverine wetlands continue to support society into the
              21st century

The objectives of this conference are to: 1) advance
              scholarship, research, and teaching focused on sustainability of watershed
              systems; 2) create public and private-sector partnerships to achieve
              interdisciplinary solutions to critical environmental and societal issues
              related to water and wetland resources; and 3) promote effective, strategically
              targeted conservation activities and public policy development through the
              transfer of ecological knowledge to non-governmental organizations,
              educational, scientific, corporate, agricultural, aquacultural, and
              governmental constituencies. The conference is being hosted by the University
              of Mississippi and will take place May 23-25, 2000.
