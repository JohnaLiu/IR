Abstract    :
              The Behavioral Husbandry and Research Program (BHRP) at Brookfield Zoo is
              currently being redeveloping.
The purpose of the BHRP is to incorporate
              behavioral observation, behavioral enrichment, and operant conditioning
              training into all aspects of captive management.  This will require extensive
              training of staff and a more rigorous, systematic appproach to behavioral
              observation than has recently been required at the zoo.  My responsibilities
              revolve primarliy around developing and maintaining a zoo-wide observational
              research program, with several goals: (1) Institute a zoo-wide program of
              routine behavioral monitoring of all animals in the zoo's collection; (2) 
              Develop training and education programs for volunteers, staff and students to
              enable them to participate in, or initiate, research studies; (3) Initiate
              long-term research on the development of reproductive and parental behavior in
              captive animals, and the possible effects of physical and social environments
              on these life history traits.  This proposal requests funding to initiate the
              primary components  of the BHRP, including staff, student, and volunteer
              training, establishment of data collection and analysis protocols, and
              development of the technological infrastructure necessary to make the program a
              success.
