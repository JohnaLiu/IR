This award supports the development of a three
              dimensional model to further quantify the possible thermal and dynamical
              response in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere predicted for the global
              change in the upper atmosphere caused by the increase in greenhouse gas
              content.  The award will build upon the expertise provided by model development
              support by previous NSF awards.  The improved model will included a new
              parameterization of infrared radiative transfer applicable to a wide range of
              CO2 concentrations.  The improvement will also include feedback mechanisms that
              modify the radiative, dynamical and chemical environments resulting from the
              predicted global change perturbations.
