The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S.
              scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research
              abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the
              use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental
              conditions abroad.
This award will provide Dr. Ilian T. Iliev with support for
              six months to work with Dr. Alejandro C. Raga at Universidad Nacional Autonoma
              de Mexico in Mexico City, Mexico. This project is being co-funded by NSF's
              Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences' Office of Multidisciplinary
              Activities.
Sometime between the recombination epoch when the universe was
              only a million years old, and the appearance of the first quasars a billion
              years or more later, most matter in the universe became ionized again.  By
              using numerical simulations to model this reionization epoch the PIs will work
              to answer the questions: What kind of objects reionized the universe and when? 
              When and how did the first objects (stars, protogalaxies) form?  How did the
              photoionizing ultraviolet background evolve?  What was the impact of this
              background on the objects forming later?  The project calls for development of
              state-of-the-art three-dimensional cosmological gas dynamics and radiation
              dynamics code to study in detail these important questions about the origin and
              evolution of the cosmic structures we see today.  They expect to conduct an
              in-depth study of the processes during the reionization of the universe and the
              effects of feedback and radiative transfer on the formation of cosmic
              structures.  This area of cosmology is concerned with understanding how all the
              structures in the universe we see are formed and evolved.
Dr. Raga and his
              collaborators have developed an interstellar gas-and radiation dynamics code,
              which will be further developed to include the effects of self-gravity,
              adapting it for cosmological simulations.
