This award supports William Schopf and students from the
              University of California-Los Angeles in a collaboration with Wolfgang Heckl of
              the Center for Nanoscience at the University of Munich, Germany.  The project
              will focus on the development of a new paleontological technique that will be
              useful in identification of Precambrian cellular microfossils and their
              remains.  Through the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM), the researchers
              intend to investigate the morphology of microfossils previously located and
              identified by older methods of microscopy, in order to learn about the
              nanostructure of the fossil remains.  The principal investigator on the German
              side is a pioneer in the application of AFM to biological and geobiological
              problems and will contribute unique expertise to the research team.  Exchange
              of junior researchers is emphasized to add an international dimension to their
              training and to allow them to establish international connections early in
              their careers.
