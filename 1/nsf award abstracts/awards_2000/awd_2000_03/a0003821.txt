Abstract    :
              This Americas program award will support travel and related expenses for the
              participation of a 
group of US graduate students and Central American
              scientists and students in a 4 day workshop to be held in Central America.  The
              purpose of the workshop is to integrate the land and marine geological and
              geophysical information that has been, and is being carried out in southern
              Central America as part of the Margins program.  These studies are focused on
              both the seismogenic zone and subduction factory objectives and aim to advance
              our understanding of geological, chemical and biological processes within and
              near the earth's active and passive margins.

The presentation of the
              preliminary results of the research will provide an excellent opportunity for
              the Central American scientists to contribute their input on the
              interpretation, and discuss the potential for deep, riser drilling to better
              answer the most fundamental questions concerning those processes.
