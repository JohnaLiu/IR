This award supports a scientific workshop and
              conference to be held for five days beginning July 3, 2000, at Adam Mickiewicz
              University in Poznan, Poland, on recent advances in the broad area of Orbital
              and Celestial Mechanics.  The Principal Investigator for this workshop is Dr.
              David Richardson of the University of Cincinnati.   The workshop hopes to sow
              seeds for future collaborative research between newly graduated scientists in
              the U.S. and in Central and Eastern Europe.  The workshop will address broad,
              diverse aspects of theoretical and applied Orbital and Celestial Mechanics to
              establish the current status and prospects for future research.  The workshop
              will bring together practical and proven numerical and analytical procedures
              with the more promising theoretical and academic research now underway
              worldwide.  The workshop will support participants from the U.S., Central and
              Eastern Europe and the Newly Independent States (NIS).  

This award fulfills
              the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in Orbital and
              Celestial Mechanics in the U.S., Central and Eastern Europe and NIS to combine
              complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and
              competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of
              benefit.
