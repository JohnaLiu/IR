Abstract    :
              This is an observational and experimental study of natural and artificially
              triggered lightning at laboratories in Gainesville and Camp Blanding, Florida. 
              Five projects will be carried out:

1. Study of the electromagnetic field
              close to lightning.
2. Analysis of the lightning energy balance.
3.
              Characterization of the initial stage of upward lightning.
4. Analysis and
              modeling of past data. 
5. Documentation and study of the lightning attachment
              process.

Results will advance the understanding of lightning physics and
              have implications for the physics and chemistry of clouds and the interaction
              of lightning with the upper atmosphere.  In addition, the work provides
              information needed for effective lightning mitigation and contributes through
              the popular press and television to public awareness of lightning hazards.
