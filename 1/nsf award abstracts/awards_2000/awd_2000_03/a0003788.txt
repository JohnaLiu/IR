This two-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in
              applied mathematics involves Michael S. Vogelius and others at Rutgers
              University and Gregoire Allaire and Eric Bonnetier of the Centre de
              Mathematiques Appliquees at the Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France.  The
              objective of this project is to study problems related to interfaces in
              composite material media. The interfaces can be microscopic or macroscopic.  In
              each case the investigators will study the effect of these interfaces on the
              macroscopic behavior of the composite.  The project takes advantage of
              complementary US and French expertise in analytical and computational aspects
              of elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDE) that appear in the context of
              composite media.

This award represents the US side of a joint proposal to
              the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF
              will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator, members of
              his group and some graduate students.  The CNRS will support the visits of
              French researchers to the United States. The collaboration will contribute to
              modeling of inhomogeneous and multiscale materials (composites). Composite
              materials, due to combined strength and weight, are important to the
              development of new materials and new technologies.
