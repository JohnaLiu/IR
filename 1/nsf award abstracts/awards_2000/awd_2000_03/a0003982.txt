The purpose of this project is to develop
              and exploit a suite of image databases, motorized Internet microscopes, and
              software to study the genetic basis of structural variation of the mouse CNS.
              Resources are open to the research community through an integrated web
              interface at <nervenet.org>.  The focus of this project is to provide 
              collaborative research environments for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs).
               QTL analysis is a burgeoning field that tackles complex biological traits
              modulated by many genes.  Four new resources and technologies will be
              developed: 1) the Mouse Brain Library, 2) the Internet Microscope System, 3)
              the NeuroCartographer Project, and  4) the Neurogenetics Tool Box.  Achieving
              the aims of these four projects will catalyze a new era in the structural
              analysis of the adult mammalian nervous system and will lead to a large number
              of novel lines of research on the development and aging of the human
              brain.

This research is funded in part by the National Science Foundation
              through its participation in the Human Brain Project, which is a Federal
              interagency research initiative, mandated by Congress as part of the "Decade of
              the Brain".
