Abstract    :
              Determining Rates and Patterns of Bedrock Incision by Large Rivers

	The
              Potomac and Susquehanna are major rivers draining a large portion of eastern
              North America.  On the banks of both rivers, above today's channels, are series
              of terraces, flat surfaces that were once the bed of the river.  As both rivers
              cur away rock and eroded their channels, these terraces were left high and dry
              up to 100 feet above the modern river.  The age of these terraces is unknown
              nor do we know if the terraces might be the result of changing past
              climate.
Our research will use new techniques in chemical and high-energy
              particle analysis to provide fundamental answers regarding the age and origin
              of these terraces.  Such information is important for our basic understanding
              of how large rivers work, particularly how they cut into hard rock.  But such
              information is also very important for building a greater public understanding
              of how prominent landscape features, such as falls, cataracts, and river
              terraces form,  Much of our work will be done in Parks, in particular, The
              National Park at Great Falls on the Potomac.  We will ensure that our results
              are included in informal science interpretive materials so that the Park's many
              visitors know more about the geologic processes that formed the landscape they
              came to view.
