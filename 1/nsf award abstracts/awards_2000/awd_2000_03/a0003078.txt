Abstract    :
              For the past two decades, the University of Michigan (UM) WISE program has
              developed and implemented a host of programmatic activities to increase the
              number of women students who successfully pursue majors, advanced degrees and
              careers in science, mathematics and engineering (SME). Program services range
              from summer workshops that have served 1,300 middle school girls to a
              living-learning residential program that has been home for more than 1,000
              first- and second- year undergraduate women; from a summer research program
              aimed at encouraging women to undertake graduate studies in science and
              engineering to a peer mentoring network for women graduate students.  The WISE
              program has made a significant impact in the recruitment and retention of women
              in SME fields.  For example, UM engineering undergraduate enrollment of women
              increased from 17% in 1980 to 32% in 1999.  In 1980, only 18% of the science
              and mathematics degrees awarded by UM went to women.  Today, 42% of the
              biochemistry majors are women; 46% of the cellular and molecular biology
              majors; 44% of the mathematics majors; and 45% of the geology majors.
