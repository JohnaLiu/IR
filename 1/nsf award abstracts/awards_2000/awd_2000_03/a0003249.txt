		Abstract.

This
              proposal consists of 2 parts. In the first (and main) part
we introduce
              certain functions on the set of
isomorphism classes of irreducible
              representations of a reductive
group over a local field. We call them
              gamma-functions. The existence
of such functions is a corollary of the local
              Langlands conjecture.
We formulate some conjectures about explicit
              construction of these
gamma-functions and explain how they can be applied to
              study the
problem of Langlands lifting itself (both locally and globally).
In
              the second part we suggest how to generalize the results of
author's joint
              paper with D.Gaitsgory entitled "Geometric
Eisenstein series". In particular
              we plan to study intersection
cohomology sheaves on parabolic Drinfelds'
              spaces and also generalize
our previous results to the case of tamely ramified
              Eisenstein series. 

This proposal is in the part of mathematics known as the
              Langlands program.
The Langlands program is part of number theory. Number
              theory is the study
of the  properties of the whole numbers and is the oldest
              branch of
mathematics. From the beginning problems in number theory have
              furnished a
driving force in creating new mathematics in other  diverse parts
              of the
discipline. The Langlands program is a  general philosophy that
              connects
number theory with calculus;  it  embodies the modern approach to the
              study
of whole numbers. One aspect of this proposal is to explore
              the
applications of geometric techniques within the Langlands program.
