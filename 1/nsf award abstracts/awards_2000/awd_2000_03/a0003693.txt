Abstract    :
              By arriving at self-enforcing agreements, agents in an ongoing strategic
              situation create surplus that benefits them both.  Little is known about how
              that surplus will be divided. This project concerns the role of reputation
              formation in such environments.  It studies a model in which players entertain
              the slight possibility that their opponents may be subject to a variety of
              behavioral biases.  Happily, it seems that these informational complications
              make it easier to predict what will usually happen in the repeated game.  There
              emerges a theory of bargaining in repeated games that strengthens some links
              between cooperative games and noncooperative game theory.

The proposal also
              addresses dynamic games, in which the different periods of play are con-nected
              by "state variables" such as capital stock or inventories.  Here one can
              examine some of the most important problems in industrial organization,
              including collusion in the face of potential entry.  One of the goals is to
              derive a generalization of the "Nash bargaining solution with threats" that can
              be applied in dynamic games.
