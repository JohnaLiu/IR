The Eastern California Shear Zone serves as a
              major component of the Pacific-North American plate boundary, accommodating
              20-25% of the total strain along this boundary, with little deformation
              occurring between the San Andreas system and the shear zone.  The San Andreas
              system is traditionally considered to mark the plate boundary between the
              Pacific plate and the North American plate, but the nature of the Eastern
              California Shear Zone is controversial, with hypotheses varying between it
              being completely analogous to a plate boundary to reflecting local effects
              within the edge of the North American plate.  This project intends to combine
              new GPS observations and geodynamical modeling to test these various
              hypotheses.  Results are expected to better clarify the role of the Eastern
              California Shear Zone in Pacific plate - North American plate tectonics.
