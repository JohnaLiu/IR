Title: Seismological Structure of
              the Inner Core and Core-Mantle Boundary

PI: Kenneth C. Creager, University
              of Washington

We propose to apply well developed and new methods to global
              digital data to examine the anisotropic and isotropic structure of the inner
              core and lowermost mantle.  We plan to analyze waveforms and differential
              travel times of five distinct compressional waves (PKPAB, PKPBC, PKPCD, PKPDF,
              and scattered phases) that propagate through the Earth's core to examine the
              large-scale variability of elastic anisotropy within the inner core and
              scattering at the base of the mantle.  We will also investigate the boundary
              layers at the top of the inner core and the bottom of the outer core.  In
              addition, we will apply a new, recently developed method to explore azimuthal
              anisotropy at the base of the mantle.  Results to date suggest strong
              anisotropy beneath southeastern Australia, perhaps associated with the hotspot
              near Tasmania.  Large-scale lateral variations in the inner core seem to be
              entirely associated with anisotropy, while the mantle exhibits a combination of
              isotropic and anisotropic variability.  Because the viscosity of the inner is
              many orders of magnitude less than the mantle, it cannot support significant
              large-scale lateral variations in density.  Because the mechanisms that change
              density (temperature and chemistry) are the same as those that change isotropic
              wave speeds, isotropic heterogeneity within the inner core should indeed be
              small.  Two other new proposed projects explore the fine structure of the
              lowermost mantle using ScP and PKP precursors as probes.
