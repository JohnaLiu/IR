Abstract    :
              	Biomass burning is a major source for atmospheric pollution over southern
              Africa as well as globally. Biomass burning emits a large variety of gaseous
              and particulate compounds with significant implications to atmospheric and
              biogeochemical cycles. This collaborative research project with Paul Crutzen,
              University of California, San Diego, Scripps, is a laboratory investigation of
              biomass burning in the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry experimental fire
              facility.  The biofuels to be studied will be collected by collaborating
              SAFARI-2000 investigators during the dry season of 2000 in three regions of
              southern Africa that are representative for major ecosystem types: The Etosha
              National Park in northern Namibia, the Kruger National Park in north-east South
              Africa and woodland sites in Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Mozambique
              (the Miombo Network).
    The experiments provide a partially controlled
              burning environment and will be used to measure major exhaust species (CO2; CO;
              CH3Cl, CH3Br, CH3I; NOx; N2O; CH4; NH3; HCl, HNO3; SO2, HCOOH, CH3COOH;
              alkaline-reactive, volatile Cl, Br and I; the ionic composition of particles
              including chloride, bromide, nitrate, sulfate, formic and acetic acid; and the
              elemental composition of particles including C, N, Cl, Br, I, S) as well as the
              elemental content of both biofuels and ash-residues. The results of this study
              will be integrated with those from other SAFARI-2000 investigators to model
              regional biomass burning emissions of halogen-, nitrogen-, sulfur-,
              carbon-containing compounds.
