This award supports a third year of funding for Mikhail Raikh
              and students from University of Utah in a collaboration with Michael Schreiber
              of the Physics Department at the University of Chemnitz, Germany. The research
              funded by this award will further our understanding of the integer quantum Hall
              effect by combining the expertise of the U.S. group in analytical techniques
              with that of the German group in numerical simulation.  Using a novel
              technique, called the renormalization group approach, the combined German and
              U.S. groups will be able to carry the understanding of the quantum Hall effect
              to a new level.  In addition, the collaboration will investigate the
              sensitivity of neutral objects to magnetic flux according to the Aharanov-Bohm
              theory.  The German group has access to excellent super-computing facilities
              and is world renowned for numerical studies of the physics of disordered
              systems.  The opportunity this joint, collaborative research effort presents
              junior researchers is substantial, and the work done on this proposal will help
              institutionalize the relationship between the German and U.S. research
              groups.
