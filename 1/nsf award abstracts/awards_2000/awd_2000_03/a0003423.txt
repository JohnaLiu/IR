	The proposed project is the continuation of an analysis
              program of data obtained in the course of a multi-institutional integrated
              study of the outflow of newly formed bottom water from the Weddell Sea and its
              dispersion into the South Atlantic Ocean.   That study was called Deep Ocean
              Ventilation Through Antarctic Intermediate Layers (DOVETAIL) and included six
              components involving hydrographic measurements, natural tracer experiments, and
              modeling studies.  It was centered east of the Drake Passage where water masses
              from the Weddell Sea and the Scotia Sea come together in the Weddell-Scotia
              Confluence, and was carried out in cooperation with the national antarctic
              programs of Germany and Spain.   The objectives of this continuation are to
              participate in the international data analysis effort, to construct an
              integrated regional data base, the organization of a special DOVETAIL journal
              issue, and the organization of a final scientific workshop.
	Ventilation of
              the deep ocean -- the rising of sub-surface water masses to the surface to be
              recharged with atmospheric gases and to give up heat to the atmosphere -- is a
              uniquely antarctic phenomenon that has significant consequences for global
              change by affecting the global reservoir of carbon dioxide, and by modulating
              the amount and extent of seasonal sea ice in the southern hemisphere.
