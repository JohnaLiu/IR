Abstract    :
              This award would carry out optical and radar measurements that would be compared
              with the results of the modeling of  the effects of proton precipitation for
              the region of the equatorward edge of the early evening sector of the auroral
              oval where protons are known to be a significant energy source.  Measurements
              of the H-alpha and H-beta Doppler profiles would be made with a new high
              resolution echelle-CCD spectrograph at polar latitudes where the EISCAT
              incoherent scatter radar would provide concurrent soundings of the
              proton-auroral ionosphere.   The proposed effort is aimed at overcoming several
              problems that have plagued the proper interpretation of such observations in
              the past.  The use of a high spectral resolution spectrograph would minimize
              the effect of auroral contamination.   The use of the incoherent scatter radar
              would make possible the acquisition of  accurate ionization profiles enabling
              the accurate determination of the average energy and the energy flux into the
              region..
