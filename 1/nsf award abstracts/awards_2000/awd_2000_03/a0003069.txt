SGER: Viral Impacts on Fluvial and Limnetic
              Biogeochemistry

Although commonly considered pathogens of animals and
              plants, viruses are now known to be pervasive in aquatic environments, where
              their populations are linked to bacteria and other microbes.  In pelagic marine
              systems, the hundreds of thousands of viruses that exist in every drop of water
              lead to the direct daily destruction of a significant portion (20-30%) of the
              microbial community.  This exploratory study will examine the impact of viruses
              on microbial communities and nutrient cycles in rivers and lakes in and around
              the Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. Borrowing established techniques from
              marine viral ecology, the investigators will determine the seasonal abundance
              and distribution of viruses and estimate the mortality they confer on the
              resident microbial communities. In addition, the impact of viruses on the
              recycling of carbon and nutrient elements will be quantified to determine the
              role of viruses in the biogeochemical cycles of these systems.
