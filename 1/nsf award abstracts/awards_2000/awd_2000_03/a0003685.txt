This award supports a three-year collaborative research
              project between Dr. H. Eugene Stanley of Boston University and Professor Masaki
              Sasai of Nagoya University in Japan.  The researchers will be undertaking a
              spectroscopic study of cooperative molecular motions in water.  The aim of the
              research is to obtain a unified view of the thermodynamic and dynamic
              properties of water by analyzing the cooperative motions of water molecules. 
              Water has many strange properties, some of which provide important clues for
              understanding its behavior.  One such remarkable feature is the existence of
              two amorphous phases at low temperature; low-density amorphous ice (LDA) and
              high-density amorphous ice (HDA).  In order to obtain reliable information on
              systems with sufficiently large correlation length, MD simulations of
              significantly larger systems are necessary.  By using the Fast Multipole
              Method, the MD simulation of the system containing up to 10/6 molecules will be
              performed and the thermal fluctuation in the supercooled region will be
              analyzed.  Metastable phases of various forms of ices and the amorphous phases
              will be experimentally examined and transformations among them will be
              investigated.    

The project brings together the efforts of two
              laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. By
              summarizing the data of experiments, MD simulations, and the statistical
              mechanical models, the phase diagram of water will be studied.  Results of the
              research will help to reveal the physical basis of the singular behavior of
              water.  This research advances international human resources through the
              participation of a postdoc and graduate students.  Through the exchange of
              ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and
              promote international understanding and cooperation.  The researchers plan to
              publish results of the research in scientific journals and report on the
              findings at scientific meetings.
