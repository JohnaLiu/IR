Abstract    :
              The field of Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) has developed significantly over
              the fast 15 years. The ability to make a part quickly with minimal (imitations
              on geometric shape has spawned applications in the fields of transportation,
              medicine, the military, microelectronics, and others.  With this growth has
              developed the need for researchers to meet to discuss fundamental and
              developmental issues of SFF.  The annual SFF Symposium was first held in 1990
              to provide a forum for technical exchange of all aspects of SFF:  materials,
              process development, physical and computational modeling, and applications.  It
              is the oldest continuous meeting in the area and is reputed to be one of the
              top research meetings in the world.

From the beginning, the philosophy of
              the SFF Symposium Organizing Committee of  student involvement has been 
              crucial to the success of the meeting and the field.  Student involvement is
              encouraged by offering a student registration rate that is approximately
              one-third of the regular rate and which for the last several years has in fact
              been approximately $150 below the per capita break-even cost.  This subsidy has
              been effective in attracting students.  Sixty-six students attended the most
              recent Symposium, approximately 37% of the entire meeting.  Participants
              represented 51 universities (19 international universities), 26 industries (5
              international) and 8 national labs and government agencies.  The interaction
              with the scientific leaders of the field is beneficial to these young
              scientists and represents an investment in the future of the US scientific
              infrastructure.
