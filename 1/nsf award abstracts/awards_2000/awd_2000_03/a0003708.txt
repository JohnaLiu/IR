This US-Colombia collaborative research project between
              Dr. William MacDonald, SUNY, Binghampton and Dr. Gloria Maria Sierra, Eafit
              University, Antioquia, Colombia, proposes to investigate the evolution of the
              early Cenozoic Amaga Basin at the north end of the Interandean Graben of the
              northern Andes, with emphasis on magnetic characteristics of the Eocene Amaga
              formation and their uses in interpreting sedimentary and tectonic processes. 
              The objectives are to improve stratigraphic correlation, to decipher sediment
              flow directions, and to interpret sources of magnetic components of these
              clastic continental sediments.

In particular, magnetic polarity
              stratigraphy, variation of magnetic anisotropic susceptibility, and analysis of
              heavy minerals, will be undertaken from samples from several sections around
              the basin.  These data will be integrated with those from other specialists to
              interpret sedimentary events in the Amaga Basin that will provide insights into
              tectonic events in the adjacent Central and Western Cordilleras bounding the
              basin on either side.   They will also be helpful in deciphering movements
              along the bounding faults along the basin margins. 

A practical aspect of
              the study involves the distribution of coal deposits and associated coal-gas:
              an improved knowledge of the stratigraphy will help in estimating resources and
              in exploration and recovery of these resources which are important to the local
              economy.
