Abstract    :
              This grant provides support for travel and subsistence for approximately 15
              graduate students, to enable them to attend the 13th International Conference
              on Clouds and Precipitation, to be held in Reno, Nevada, on 14-18 August 2000. 
              A selection committee chaired by Dr. John Hallett of the Desert Research
              Institute will screen the applications and allocate the awards.  Preference
              will be given to applicants who will contribute to the conference and for whom
              there is an element of financial need.  Participation is limited to graduate
              students in U.S. academic institutions registered in graduate programs in
              meteorology, atmospheric science, or closely related fields.
