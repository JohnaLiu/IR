The general goals of the project are to continue GPS
              measurements of deformation in the South American Andes, and to integrate
              deformation with the earthquake cycle and with coupling on the subduction zone
              and longer-term tectonic deformation.  The importance of the research is that
              it examines fundamental mechanisms behind how subduction created the modern
              Andes and deformed this continental margin.  Specific research tasks include:
              obtaining and analyzing GPS data from Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia and
              coordinating with other GPS efforts in South America;  expanding the principal
              investigator's GPS network; looking at back-arc deformation and at the
              post-seismic effects of the 1960 earthquake; and improving velocity estimates. 
              The P.I.s will model longer term deformation (tectonic deformation) associated
              with the stress history of subduction and mantle coupling in the wedge.  They
              will model various tractions arising from the edge of the lithosphere, the base
              of the plate, larger scale mantle flow, plate motions and basal forces.   They
              will examine the distribution and nature of seismic deformation related to
              subduction in both the lithosphere and crust, especially the 1960 earthquake,
              and the deformation associated with oblique convergence.

This combination of
              the GPS measurements and mantle flow modeling is an attempt to understand the
              fundamental mantle forces that shape convection at an archetypal convergent
              continental margin.  The multifaceted approach (GPS, seismology, modeling) will
              integrate the various geodynamic components into a comprehensive model of the
              mountain building process.
