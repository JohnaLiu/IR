     We propose to develop realistic
              thermodynamic models for solid solutions that will adequately describe
              short-range ordering utilizing a new version of the Cluster Variation Method
              (CVM). This version of CVM will afford accurate descriptions for
              configurational entropy, internal energy and volume of mixed crystals; it will
              not have the computational difficulties and limitations associated with
              conventional CVM approaches. These solution models will expand upon the
              approach developed by Balabin and Sack (2000) wherein the correlation
              polynomials that are typically employed as configuration variables in CVM are
              replaced by explicit formulations of linear relations between the probabilities
              of cluster configurations. This approach will be applied to (Zn,Fe)S
              sphalerites and (Ca,Na,Mg,Fe2+)(Mg,Al,Fe3+,Fe2+)Si2O6 pyroxenes (omphacites).
              In the former short-range ordering due to strong interactions within the first
              nearest neighbor(nn)-triangle appear to result in long-range ordering and
              formation of ordered compounds with limited compositional ranges (Balabin and
              Sack, 2000). In omphacitic pyroxenes strong short-range ordering induced by
              coupled substitutions (e.g., NaAl - MgCa) results in a reduction of the space
              group symmetry from C2/c to P2/n. The CVM treatment for Fe-sphalerite will
              utilize cuboctahedron (13 atoms) and fcc-cube (14 atoms) basis clusters, and it
              will allow for an arbitrary degree of both short- and long-range ordering
              subject to the restriction that any edge of the elementary cell of a
              superstructure does not exceed four times the parameter ao of the initial
              lattice. Basis clusters containing 8 and 20 atoms will be utilized in the model
              for omphacitic pyroxenes. Explicit provision will be made for local charge
              balance in the lattice and nn, next to nearest neighbor (nnn)  and madn body
              interactions. The methods developed in the proposed research will be widely
              applicable to other mineral systems.
