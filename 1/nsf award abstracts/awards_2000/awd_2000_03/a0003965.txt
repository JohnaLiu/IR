The viability of household-based agriculture in competition
              with corporate farm commodity producers has been an enduring interest of
              third-world development studies. This project assesses the effects of free
              trade policies in farming communities on St. Lucia, which has the largest
              number of banana farms in the Windward Islands, Caribbean. The research
              assesses the predictions prevalent in the Caribbean that the 1998 World Trade
              Organization ruling striking down a tariff-quota system of preferential
              treatment would be severely detrimental to household banana production. 
              However other theorists predict that household commodity producers can use
              their lower labor and production costs to remain competitive. In addition to
              testing these hypotheses the project will document the ways growers respond to
              globalization in the political realm given local traditions of intense rural
              political activity, as well as illustrate the extent to which neoliberal models
              of trade are politically sustainable in the Eastern Caribbean. The project will
              study farms in two nearby locales, testing hypotheses about differentiation,
              survival in farming and political activity through participant observation,
              semi-structured interviews of knowledgeable informants, and structured surveys
              of banana growers in the two regions. The new knowledge to be created will be
              valuable to development theorists as well as planners.
