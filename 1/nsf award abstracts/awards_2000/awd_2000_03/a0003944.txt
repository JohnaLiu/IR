This award supports Dr. G-Yull Rhee, Laboratory of
              Environmental Biology, Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health,
              to conduct collaborative research with
Dr. Jongseol Kim of the University of
              Ulsan in Korea.  The joint study will investigate cell death among
              phytoplankton species.  Phytoplankton cell death is an important loss process
              that affects the productivity of aquatic ecosystems.  While external factors
              such as herbivore grazing and viral infection are major causes of cell death,
              internally-driven physiological death may also play a significant role in
              phytoplankton mortality.  If the physiological death rate varies with species,
              it will not only affect primary productivity, but also interspecies competition
              and succession.  Since cell death is accompanied by the release of dissolved
              organic carbon, it can also divert photosynthetically-fixed carbon to the
              microbial loop. 

This project will combine the complementary expertise and
              facilities of the American and Korean laboratories to advance our mutual
              understanding of the problem.
