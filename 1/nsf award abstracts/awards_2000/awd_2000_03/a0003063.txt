Abstract    :
              The Industry/University Cooperative Reseaerch Center (I/UCRC) in Ergonomics at
              Texas A&M University is being renewed for the first year of a five year
              continuing grant. The research of the Center will contribute to the technology
              and information base necessary to evaluate and redesign existing workplace
              environments and work methods and to provide the leadership for the effective
              design of future work systems.  The Center will continue to provide an
              opportunity for industry to coordinate and direct research objectives in
              response to safety, health, and ergonomic guidelines and standards that are
              being adopted.  A focused research program will span interdisciplinary fields
              aimed at reducing injury/illness rates; reducing cumulative trauma disorders;
              reducing costs; increasing productivity; and developing responses and research
              for regulatory activity.
