Much of the western United States
              continental lithosphere was assembled from 1.8 to 1.6 Ga, but the tectonic
              style of assembly is controversial, in particular the blocks or terranes of
              different precambrian characteristics may have been juxtaposed primarily by
              orthogonal and sequential subduction or the major mechanism may have been
              transpressional translation.  This project will examine the geochemistry in
              detail of occurrences of ultramafic rocks that seem to spatially be associated
              with boundaries of precambrian blocks, thus suggesting subduction.  A sea-floor
              ophiolitic geochemical signature would considerably strengthen this option
              whereas absence would point to alternatives including strike-slip assembly. 
              Results are expected to influence understanding on how the continental
              lithosphere of much of the western United States was assembled.
