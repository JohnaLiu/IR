This applied research will capitalize on work that has been
              done over the past four years and will, by means of a controlled study, explore
              the factors that contribute to sustainable reform in a Local Systemic Change
              (LSC) project.  The experiment is unique, as the project in the Atlanta Public
              Schools (APS) is the only one in the entire Teacher Enhancement portfolio which
              has associated with it an anthropologist-in-residence who will carry out this
              research.  Informed by the conceptual framework outlined in the proposal, the
              study will reveal factors that encourage or inhibit adoption of constructivist
              science pedagogy by APS teachers.

The context for the research is the
              Elementary Science Educational Partners (ESEP) project.  This is a five-year
              LSC project which serves approximately 1,600 K-5 teachers in 69 elementary
              schools in Atlanta.  The EXEP project is in its final stages and the study is
              timely in that there are many important lessons to be learned about the impact
              of NSF investment in an urban school district.  Such research will help provide
              answers.
