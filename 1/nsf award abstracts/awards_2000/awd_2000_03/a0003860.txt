This award provides one-half support of the costs of building
              a cluster of networked PC's (so called Beowulf cluster) for research in
              theoretical and applied seismology at Caltech.  Jeroen Tromp and John Shaw have
              recently joined the faculty at Caltech after serving for several years on the
              faculty at Harvard University.  They will build a 78 dual-CPU node Beowulf
              cluster with 78 Gb of RAM.  The cluster will be used to run Tromp's spectral
              element code that has been specifically designed to run on multi-processor
              machines.  The spectral element method represents one of the most comprehensive
              and robust algorithms for modeling seismic wave propagation though deep
              sedimentary basins (i.e. the Los Angeles basin) and for predicting the
              amplitude of strong ground motions that result from varying earthquake source
              parameters.  Beowulf clusters represent a cost effective alternative to
              expensive shared-memory machines for high resolution modeling of large
              geophysical data sets.
