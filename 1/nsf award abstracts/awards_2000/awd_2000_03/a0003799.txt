This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              involves Gerbrand Ceder of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Claude
              Delmas of the Institut de Chimie de la Matiere Condensee de Bordeaux in
              Bordeaux, France.  The collaboration addresses synthesis, characterization, and
              modeling of electrode materials. In particular, the behavior, electrochemical
              and structural properties of lithium insertion materials and phase
              transformation of layered transition-metal oxides will be investigated. Lithium
              based systems are considered a promising technology for rechargeable batteries
              as a clean, inexpensive, portable form of power storage. The US group brings to
              this collaboration theoretical expertise in using first principles computations
              to predict properties of lithium insertion materials.  This is complemented by
              the experimental capabilities of the French group in phase transitions, in
              synthesis and NMR studies of lithium based materials. 

This award represents
              the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National Center for
              Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses
              for the US investigator and graduate student.  The CNRS will support the visits
              of French researchers to the United States.
