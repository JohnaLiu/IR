Abstract    :
              Since its establishment in 1974, the Indian Natural Resource, Science and
              Engineering Program (INRSEP) at Humboldt State University has trained about 40%
              of the nation's natural resource professionals of Native American descent. The
              underlying philosophy at INRSEP is to maintain a strong academic program which
              is intrinsically linked to Native American cultural perspectives.  Services
              provided include academic advising and advocacy, personal and cultural
              counseling, tutorials, cooperative education and internships.  Students are
              also provided guidance in balancing Western science with traditional holistic
              beliefs. Thirty-one INRSEP students graduated in the sciences over the past
              three years. The program currently enrolls 43 students from 27 tribal
              entities.
