This award will fund a dissertation enhancement
              grant for Laura Lopez Hoffman, under the direction of Dr. David Ackerly,
              Stanford University, in collaboration with researchers from the Instituto para
              la Conservacion del Lago de Maracaibo, in western Venezuela. The researchers
              will investigate how different environmental conditions can affect plant
              performance by examining the effects of salinity and light on the carbon gain,
              growth and demography of two species of neo-tropical mangroves.  They will test
              the hypothesis that the effects of increasing light availability on mangroves
              are beneficial and detrimental at low and high salinity respectively.
 

The
              hypothesis will be addressed at three levels of analysis: leaf physiology,
              whole plant growth, and population dynamics, using a combination of greenhouse
              experiments at Stanford University and field studies in Venezuela. The results
              will be integrated through physiological and demographic models and are
              expected to make  significant contributions in the areas of ecological scaling
              and mangrove restoration and sustainable harvesting.
