A dearth of paleomagnetic data from volcanic rocks
              hampers our understanding of temporal variations of the geomagnetic field,
              including field reversals, during the last 5 My. Although a number of
              increasingly sophisticated models for the geodynamo and the reversal process
              have been proposed in recent years, such models are being tested with a
              severely limited knowledge of the nature of field variation. One of the
              greatest problems with regard to paleosecular variation (PSV), time-averaged
              field (TAF), and reversal modeling is a geographical bias in the paleomagnetic
              data set. Most of the current data come from sites in the northern hemisphere,
              and a more uniform distribution of paleomagnetic sites for the last 5 My is
              critical to improving our understanding. Preliminary paleomagnetic study of
              Ascension Island rocks by the PI has shown that Ascension Island has the
              potential to provide quality PSV, TAF, and reversal data. This study will
              perform a detailed paleomagnetic study of Ascension Island rocks in conjunction
              with precision 40Ar/39Ar dating and mineralogical analyses, producing
              high-quality PSV and TAF data. It also has the potential to reveal reversals
              recorded in the volcanic flows of Ascension Island. In addition, magnetic
              mineralogy work, including identification of any post-emplacement alteration of
              mineralogy, and precision radiometric dating of the rocks will certainly help
              to better define the geologic history of this hot spot island on the flank of
              the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The project will significantly involve undergraduate
              students, who will participate in exciting, cutting-edge of research.
