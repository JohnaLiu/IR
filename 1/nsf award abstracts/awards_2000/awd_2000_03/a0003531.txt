Melting of rocks in Earth's crust is an important process
              during mountain building (orogeny). It can account for the large volume of
              granite in upper levels of mountain belts, such as are exposed in the
              geologically active Himalayan mountain belt and in the eroded Appalachian and
              Variscan orogenic belts, and it is responsible for the chemical differentiation
              of the continental crust.  In addition, the presence of melt and melt movement,
              in particular the extraction of melt from deep crustal sources and emplacement
              of melt in shallower crust, influence the rheology of the crust and can greatly
              affect the style of deformation associated with mountain building. This project
              aims to constrain the nature of the movement of melt generated by the fusion of
              rocks in the continental crust. To do this, a number of techniques, some well
              established and some novel, will be used to constrain the geometry of melt
              distribution in rocks that once hosted melt. New techniques include
              quantitative image analysis of melt-related structures in rocks,
              high-resolution computed X-ray tomography, and scanning electron microscope
              cathodoluminescence. Constraints thus obtained on the spatial distribution of
              melt will allow an assessment of the possible melt flow and deformation
              mechanisms associated with melt movement. This, in turn, will serve to
              constrain the possible rates of melt accumulation in large volumes, and the
              rates of melt-attended deformation, providing insight into the physical and
              chemical evolution of active mountain belts.
