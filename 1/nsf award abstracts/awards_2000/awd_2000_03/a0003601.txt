We will utilize the unique chronological framework provided
              by the crystallization history of zircon and allanite to investigate the
              relative magnitudes of thermal and mass fluxes through evolving rhyolite
              systems.  Four major centers of silicic volcanism will be studied: 1) the
              Bishop Tuff and Glass Mountain rhyolites of Long Valley, California; 2) the
              Youngest Toba Tuff of Sumatra, Indonesia; 3) the Central Plateau Member
              rhyolites of the Yellowstone caldera complex, Wyoming; and 4) Coso volcanic
              field, California.  Ages of individual crystal domains will be obtained by in
              situ ion microprobe 238U-206Pb and 238U-230Th dating.  Guided by the age
              distributions, the ion microprobe will be used to determine the trace element
              zoning profiles of the crystals and of the compositions of their melt
              inclusions.  Complementary isotopic analyses will be performed by microdrilling
              of well-characterized grains.  Our goals are: 1) to determine the timing of
              differentiation and the differentiation "memory" of crystals in caldera-forming
              systems (Long Valley, Toba, and Yellowstone calderas); and 2) to investigate
              the chemical dynamics of evolving rhyolite systems which are relatively
              phenocryst-rich and poor (Toba and Coso volcanic fields).  Collectively, these
              studies will provide a deeper understanding of the dynamic interplay between
              secular cooling, magmatic recharge, and crustal assimilation in rhyolite
              evolution.
