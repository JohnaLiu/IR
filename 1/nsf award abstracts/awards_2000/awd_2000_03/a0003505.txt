Title: Evaluating Static and
              Dynamic Stress Transfer Triggering

PI's: S. Gross, University of
              Colorado

The goal of this research is to study the triggering of
              earthquakes, especially aftershocks. The clear association of aftershocks with
              their mainshocks suggests that mainshocks trigger their aftershocks, but the
              mechanisms of that triggering are still debated. Triggering studies have
              repeatedly shown that aftershocks occur preferentially in fault zones upon
              which stresses have been concentrated as a result of permanent fault offset.
              This is surprising because these stress changes can be very small, orders of
              magnitude smaller than the stress change on an earthquake source. Recent
              results reveal that the much larger transient stress changes, generated by
              passing seismic waves, are also a viable triggering model. In order to decide
              which models are best, I will apply similar statistical measures to each model
              and apply them to the same data to compare them as fairly as possible. With
              this aim, I will study both static and dynamic stress transferred in both the
              1992 Landers and 1999 Hector Mine earthquake sequences. I will evaluate the
              correlation of stress changes with aftershock distributions, using a unified
              battery of statistical tests so that the most consistent models may be
              identified and the influence of model errors quantified. In addition to
              comparing static and dynamic triggering models, I will explore models that
              include stresses due to postseismic processes, and see if inversions for the
              background stress state are consistent between the two sequences.
