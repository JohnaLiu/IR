This is a five-year collaboration with Indian scientists
              (Bangalore, Bombay and Wadia Institute) to unravel the details of movement and
              deformation of the Indian plate.  The investigators expect to constrain the
              rotation rate of India, the rate of change of convergence velocity along the
              Himalayan arc, and some of the details of giant earthquakes that have ruptured
              there in the past two centuries using Global Positioning System geodesy. 
              Geodetic measurements within India will reveal the rate at which the Indian
              plate is deforming and provide insights into the rate of occurrence, and
              possible location, of future mid-plate earthquakes.  The recent Bhuj M=7.6
              earthquake whose study has been initiated as part of this project, has many
              similarities to the infrequent great mid-plate earthquakes that afflicted North
              America in the early 19th century.  Seismic hazard findings from India are thus
              likely not only to benefit mid-21st-century India, when it will be the most
              populous country in the world, but also the USA, the country that has the most
              to lose economically from future mid-plate earthquakes.  This work also
              includes measurements of absolute gravity, as well as maintenance and upgrade
              of the F5 absolute gravimeter.  Additionally, startup funds from INT are
              included for collaboration with Pakistani colleagues at the University of
              Peshewar for a geodynamic study of the western edge of the Indian Plate.
