Abstract    :
              
The Chicago Academy of Sciences, in collaboration with the Girl Scouts of
              Chicago, will expand Science in the City, an innovative science, math and
              technology program that targets hard-to-reach urban girls living in homeless
              shelters and housing developments throughout Chicago.  This project will offer
              engaging activities and real-world applications to teach hands-on-science,
              math, and technology to 120 girls ages nine through fourteen, over a one-year
              period.  In an effort to combat the physical and social isolation that these
              girls feel, they will be brought together monthly to the Peggy Notebaert Nature
              Museum to participate in a variety of activities, programs, and events.  These
              girls will attend workshops to obtain hard-to-get science badges, have fun with
              their families at "Science for Families Days" and educational field trips,
              learn about science careers during a job shadow day with museum staff,
              participate in a five-day summer camp, and learn how science affects their
              everyday lives.  Successful women scientists will function as teachers and role
              models to help build the girls' science knowledge, career choices, and
              self-esteem.  As an in-kind match, the Academy will provide each girl with a
              one-year Family Membership to the Nature Museum, so that they will continue to
              explore and learn beyond the scope of this program.
