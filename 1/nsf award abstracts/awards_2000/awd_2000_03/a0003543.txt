ABSTRACT 

The
              investigators propose a systematic study to understand the fundamental
              processes responsible for the various effects recognized in rock friction. They
              will conduct experiments aimed at understanding what processes are responsible
              for the time dependence of interaction between single frictional contacts,
              multiple contacts, and contacts in gouge, especially on slip surfaces within
              gouge. The purpose is to understand the frictional behavior observers might
              expect to find on faults during most parts of the earthquake cycle. The problem
              is that the well-known empirical rate and state friction description of
              friction, as determined in the laboratory, cannot presently be extended to
              faults in the Earth with any confidence, because we do not understand the
              fundamental processes underlying the behavior. To understand earthquake
              nucleation it is a fundamental requirement to understand the time dependence
              that allows faults to strengthen between dynamic events and causes them to
              weaken as slip accelerates. The investigators will conduct a series of
              microindentation and friction experiments designed to differentiate between the
              most likely classes of explanations by variation of fluid chemistry and
              temperature and through an intensive microstructural study.
