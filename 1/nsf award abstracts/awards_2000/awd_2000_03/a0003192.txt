Abstract    :
              The mass balance of tropical cyclones is not well understood, but better
              understanding is crucial to understanding hurricane dynamics and to understand
              hurricane precipitation processes.  The principal objective of this research is
              to improve the accuracy of rainfall estimates in landfalling tropical cyclones
              through improvement in the understanding of the relative importance of
              different precipitation processes at various locations in hurricanes and their
              effects upon storm structure.  Data to be analyzed is from a new, advanced
              cloud physics instrument that was deployed during the summer of 1998. 
              Specifically, data will be analyzed to determine cloud particle density under a
              variety of environmental conditions.  This research will be conducted in
              collaboration with NOAA scientists and success will lead to improved
              understanding of precipitation processes within hurricanes.
