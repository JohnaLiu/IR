Abstract    :
              
Political ecology is an approach that looks at human-environmental
              interactions as they are influenced by and in turn affect local political
              processes. This dissertation research by a cultural anthropologist from the
              University of Minnesota will study development and political ecology in two
              villages in Papua New Guinea.  One village is engaged in ecotourism and
              conservation while the other is involved with a commercial gold mining
              corporation.  Using ethnographic and archival research methods the student will
              determine the impact of difference resource strategies on land concentration
              and social stratification; will study the relation between community identity,
              values and competing economic processes; and the relation between specific
              resource regimes and community political activity.  Hypotheses will be tested
              relating levels of compensation and inequality, empowerment, and cultural
              control of resources. By comparing two culturally similar villages the research
              will assess the effects of these difference paths to development on the local
              social systems.  This will extend our understanding of how global systems of
              resource management are engaged locally, and how communities differentiate
              themselves.  The project will add to our knowledge of this important region of
              the world, and will help train a young social scientist.
