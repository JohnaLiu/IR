Very likely some of the world's most outstanding TV footage of
              Hawaiian volcanology resides in an archive closet at the United State
              Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcanological Observatory (USGS-HVO).  This project
              will transfer-edit the highlights of this excellent analogue TV footage, as
              well as many hundreds of hours of geothermal field footage into digital form
              with as many as ten programmatic editing foci suitable for interactive
              recitation teaching modules for geoscience curricular use.  These produced
              programs will involve Question/Answer segments where the program can be
              stopped, reviewed, replayed and even used by the audience to make visual-and
              time measurements necessary to answer the narrative-asked, laboratory-style
              questions.  Thus the digitization makes possible some very exciting interactive
              teaching and lab modules and digital TV format makes these kinds of interaction
              possible with far greater ease than older AV/TV technologies.  The planned
              interactive modules will use the intrinsic visual excitement of volcanology,
              not just to teach geology, environmental science and petrology, but also to
              teach the inter-related basic math, physics and chemistry concepts.  This
              proposal promises the following six major tasks: (1) the digital editing of
              ten, 30-50 minute long volcanological/geothermal programs with interactive
              audience exercises in each program (2) in-school audience testing of the
              digitally edited programs with special attention to the interactive segments;
              field testing with 4th, 10th, and college level audiences will be performed;
              (3) these field trials will lead to three audience-appropriate levels of
              interactive segment for each program; (4) these digitally prepared materials
              (both digital TV and CD) will be presented at NAGT workshops at national GSA
              meetings; (5) arrangement to guarantee the widest possible royalty-free
              distribution of finished curricular products will be performed by a website
              technology, and (6) the technological transfer to a digital data base of
              hundreds of hours of volcanological and geothermal TV images.
