This one-year award supports the participation of U.S.
              graduate students in an international conference and workshop on measuring
              efficiency and productivity to be held at Union College, Schenectady, New York,
              June 15-21, 2000.  An important objective of the workshop is to encourage
              collaboration between scholars in the U.S. and Western Europe.  Papers will be
              presented on techniques for measuring and explaining technical efficiency,
              allocative efficiency and productivity.  Technical efficiency is the extent to
              which maximum output is obtained from a given bundle of inputs.  Allocative
              efficiency is the extent to which inputs are combined to produce a bundle of
              outputs at minimum cost.  Productivity is the expansion of production
              possibilities from given inputs over time as a result of technological advance.
               These issues underlie individual firm competitiveness and standard of
              living.

The workshop provides an opportunity to discuss issues presented in
              the formal conference.  Senior researchers and graduate students will present
              seminars on work in progress.  "Birds of a feather" sessions will be organized
              to link scholars with common interests, especially graduate students from the
              U.S. and abroad.  The conference and workshop is interdisciplinary and will
              bring together econometricians, statisticians, and representatives from
              industry, academia and government.
