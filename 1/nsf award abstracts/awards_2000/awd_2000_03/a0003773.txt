Rothschild
This award supports a third year of funding for Richard
              Rothschild and students from the University of California-San Diego in a
              collaboration with Rudiger Staubert of the Department of Astronomy at the
              University of Tuebingen, Germany.  The research focus is on the analysis and
              interpretation of X-ray data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The
              U.S. team has a strong knowledge of the strengths and limitations of the data
              obtained from RXTE and the German team is strong in the development and use of
              advanced interpretive tools.  Together, the two teams are in a unique position
              to use the raw X-ray data to answer current astrophysical questions. 
              Specifically, the two groups will improve our understanding of processes
              associated with neutron stars and black holes. The opportunity this joint,
              collaborative research effort presents junior researchers is substantial, and
              the work done on this proposal will help institutionalize the relationship
              between the German and U.S. research groups.
