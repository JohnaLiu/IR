This award supports the American Association for the
              Advancement of Science (AAAS) Women's International Scientific Collaboration
              (WISC) Program.  WISC is a two-year program to encourage U.S. women scientists
              to develop new international cooperative research projects and partners.  WISC
              will allow U.S. women scientists to travel to Central and Eastern Europe and
              Eurasia and stay up to four weeks in order to develop a formal research
              proposal to conduct basic research in an international environment.  WISC is
              open to women scientists in the following fields: archeology; anthropology;
              biology; chemistry; earth sciences; economics; environmental sciences;
              geography and demography; linguistics; political science; non-clinically
              oriented psychology; and sociology.  WISC especially encourages
              interdisciplinary research projects.  If there is a U.S. research team, up to
              two female members of that team can apply for WISC grants as long as at least
              one of them is a principal investigator.   The grants, up to a maximum of
              $4,000, will cover travel and living expenses for the U.S. investigator to go
              abroad.  Any excess funds can also be used for supplies and equipment needed
              during the planning period for a second visit - either for the U.S. scientist
              or for her partner to come to the U.S.  Three rounds of competition will be
              offered between October 2000 and October 2002 for a total of twenty grants. 
              

The AAAS WISC Program fulfills the NSF program objectives of bringing
              together leading experts in the U.S. and Central and Eastern Europe and Eurasia
              to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual
              interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of
              benefit.
