Tectonic models for orogenic belts rely on
              various kinematic indicators to determine such things as maximum and minimum
              stress directions, "stretching directions" and sense of shear.  One fundamental
              assumption has been that tectonic transport directions parallel mineral or
              extension lineation directions, however three-dimensional numeric modeling of
              shear zones indicates that this is not always a valid assumption.  This project
              will address this issue using the western Idaho shear zone that marks the
              accretion of allochthonous terranes to the west to the north American plate
              during the Late Cretaceous.  The kinematic and geologic data have resulted in
              several, disparate models for this accretion.  This study is an integrated
              structural, microstructural and U/Pb geochronologic project designed to
              determine the kinematic history of the late Cretaceous western Idaho shear zone
              that will employ three-dimensional techniques to test the validity of the
              assumption that tectonic transport is parallel to lineation.  Results should
              help clarify the kinematics of this suture and evaluate one of the important
              kinematic assumptions used in interpretations of many orogens elsewhere.
