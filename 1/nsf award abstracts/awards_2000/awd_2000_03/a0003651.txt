Abstract    :
              WGBH is producing twenty, new, half-hour programs for the fourth season of
              "ZOOM."  Uniquely for, by and about kids, "ZOOM" gives its viewers a chance to
              explore, experiment and share their creativity with the world.  Targeted at
              children 8-11 years-old, "ZOOM" features a diverse cast of seven children who
              build bridges, solve puzzles, play games, respond to challenges and act out
              stories, as they bring to life contributions sent in by viewers from across the
              country.  

"ZOOM" currently is carried by 281 public broadcasting stations
              and is viewed by an average of 5.22 million children per week.  The "ZOOM"
              website receives 18,000 - 20,000 visits per day with kids averaging 30 minutes
              per visit.  The specific goals for Season IV are to:  (1) connect science to
              kids' every day world and every day lives; (2) promote Habits of Mind and an
              understanding of the basic science and math within three content areas; (3)
              expand ZOOM's outreach activities, and (4) increase parental involvement in
              children's "ZOOM"-related activities.  The themes for the new seasons will
              include "Your Biome," "Kitchen Chemistry," and "Structures."  Outreach for the
              project will include printed materials for kids, families and educators;
              "ZOOM"-related activities at community-based organizations, shopping malls and
              science museums; and a 3000-page web site.
