Preliminary sulfur multiple-isotope data point to a
              fundamental change in the processes controlling the sulfur cycle during the
              Paleoproterozoic (2.0 to 2.5 Ga).  These data suggest that before this time,
              the sulfur cycle was strongly influenced by atmospheric sulfur chemistry. 
              After this time, the sulfur cycle was more strongly influenced by oxidative
              weathering and microbial sulfate reduction, and is inferred to be similar to
              the modern, pre-anthropogenic sulfur cycle. To extend these preliminary
              conclusions and to understand the role of oxidative weathering and microbial
              reduction on the Precambrian sulfur cycle, a three part strategy is needed: (1)
              Additional documentation of the sulfur multiple-isotope geochemistry in
              sedimentary, metasedimentary and igneous rocks will provide a record of the
              role of atmospheric sulfur chemistry in the sulfur cycle over time; (2) A
              deeper examination of the Paleoproterozoic transition period that is evidenced
              by D33S shifts in our preliminary data, will add new insights into the changes
              that occurred at 2.0-2.5 Ga and explore possible links to the intensity of
              oxidatitve weathering and the atmospheric oxidation state;  (3) further
              investigation of the Archean sulfur cycle will constrain the roles of
              atmospheric reactions, oxidative weathering, and microbial activity in the
              Earth's earliest sulfur cycle.
