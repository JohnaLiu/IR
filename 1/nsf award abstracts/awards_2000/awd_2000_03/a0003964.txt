Poor health and nutrition in pregnant
              women is the beginning of a vicious cycle of faltering growth in childhood and
              later life. This project involves the dissertation research of a cultural
              anthropologist from the University of Oregon, studying how the health of women
              and children is affected by maternal nutritional status, which is in turn
              affected by cultural dietary proscriptions during pregnancy. The student will
              examine how social relations of slum-dwellers in New Delhi, India produce
              inequalities of class, caste and gender which affect food consumption during
              pregnancy. The project includes ethnographic exploration of relations between
              cultural diet proscriptions and pregnant women's nutritional status though
              study of the local cultural explanatory model of appropriate diet; standard
              diet and anthropometric analysis of nutrient shortages of pregnant women; an
              ethnographic examination of the relation between a woman's pregnancy history
              and her current diet; an ethnographic study of the effect of rural-urban
              migration on family structure and the resulting effect on food consumption by
              pregnant women; and an analysis of how current health education programs can be
              improved.  The results of this project will be important for health planners in
              the developing world, will provide valuable information about this region of
              the world, and will help train a young social scientist.
