The investigators propose to perform a set of 3-D numerical
              modeling experiments, focusing on three recent California earthquake sequences:
              (1) the 1992 Landers earthquake, its potential role in triggering the 1999
              Hector Mine event, and their combined effects on the southern San Andreas
              fault; (2) the 1983 Coalinga and 1985 Kettleman Hills blind-thrust quakes and
              their potential effects on delaying seismic rupture on the Parkfield segment of
              the San Andreas fault; and (3) the most recent sequence of historical quakes in
              the Los Angeles region, including the 1933 Long Beach, 1952 Kern County, 1971
              San Fernando, 1987 Whittier Narrows, and 1994 Northridge events, and their
              implications on seismic hazard migration in the Los Angeles region.  Recently
              the investigators have successfully developed preliminary 3-D viscoelastic
              models for a small subset of the above California sequences.  This project will
              allow them to carry out a much more comprehensive investigation through (1)
              extending the models to include all relevant quakes, (2) verifying the
              robustness of the model solutions and their sensitivity to assumptions in
              crustal rheology and fault geometry, and (3) comparing the model results with
              geodetic observations.  Results of this modeling investigation, together with
              advances in space geodesy and seismic monitoring capabilities, should provide
              us with a much clearer understanding of the seismic properties of the
              California crust, the mechanisms of earthquake triggering, and the regularities
              in seismic hazard migration in California.  This is a collaborative project
              between the UC Berkeley (Andy Freed) and WHOI (Jian Lin).  Freed will lead 3-D
              modeling experiments using the I-deas viscoelastic modeling code, while Lin
              will lead tasks of comparing the I-deas solutions to independent results from
              the GENPro boundary-element code and analyzing the geodetic and earthquake data
              in the study regions to constrain modeling.
