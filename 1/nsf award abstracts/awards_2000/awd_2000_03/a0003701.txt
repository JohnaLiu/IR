This award supports a three-year collaborative research
              project between Professor Bernd Bassalleck of the University of New Mexico and
              Professor Tomokazu Fukuda of the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization
              (KEK) in Japan.  The researchers will undertake a study of hyperon-hyperon and
              hyperon-nucleon interaction.  This is the most fundamental baryon-baryon
              interaction involving one and two strange quarks, respectively.  The primary
              focus of the proposal is the approved KEK experiment E452.  Its goal is the
              study of the spin-dependent interaction between the E+ hyperon and the proton,
              in particular the E+ spin-orbit interaction, which is predicted to be large. 
              What makes this particularly interesting is the sharp contrast to the now
              firmly established smallness of the A spin-orbit interaction.  The actual
              measurement to be performed is the left-right asymmetry in the elastic
              scattering of polarized E+ off protons using a novel scintillation detector
              with Image Intensifier and CCD readout for complete 3-dimensional track
              reconstruction.  

The project brings together the efforts of two
              laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. 
              Results of this research should provide a significant enhancement of our
              understanding of the fundamental baryon-baryon interaction utilizing the
              strange quark as a special probe not normally available in conventional nuclear
              physics.   Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will
              broaden our base of  basic knowledge and promote international understanding
              and cooperation.  The researchers plan to publish results of their research in
              scientific journals and report on the findings at scientific meetings.
