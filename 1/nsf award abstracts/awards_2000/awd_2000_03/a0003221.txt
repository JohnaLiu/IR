Abstract    :
              The University of Northern Iowa seeks funding to replace obsolete equipment. 
              UNI will replace the obsolete equipment with current Unidata systems such as
              McIDAS and GEMPAK.  Currently, UNI is still running the outdated OS/2-McIDAS
              system.  With the new equipment, opportunities  will be expanded for student 
              use of real-time atmospheric measurements within existing courses and in
              research.  In addition, meteorology courses will be enhanced to provide greater
              research opportunities for undergraduate students and faculty in the area of
              atmospheric sciences.
