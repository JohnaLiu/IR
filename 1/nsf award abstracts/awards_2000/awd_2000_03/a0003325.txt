Abstract    :
              This study will focus on the Rural Systemic Initiatives Program to compile
              current understandings and identify new issues, resource and strategies of
              importance to those currently working in rural settings.  This exploratory
              research will involve: 1)an investigation and analysis of the content and use
              of large-scale databases; 2)interviews with educators, researchers, and
              reformers working to improve science education in rural settings; and 3)a
              meeting of key stakeholders to focus on sharing understandings about districts'
              access to and engagement in the rural reform and successful strategies for data
              collection and analysis.
