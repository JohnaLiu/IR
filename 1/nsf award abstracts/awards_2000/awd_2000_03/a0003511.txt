Recent studies at the Macrodispersion Experiment (MADE)
              site in Columbus, Mississippi have indicated that the preferential flow paths
              resulting from aquifer heterogeneities at decimeter (dm) and smaller scales
              appear to have a dominant effect on plume-scale solute transport.  This
              collaborative research responds to the general lack of studies on the effect of
              dm-scale heterogeneities on plume-scale solute transport as observed at the
              MADE site.  Our intent is to systematically study the characteristics of solute
              transport influenced by dm-scale preferential flow paths, and rigorously test
              the hypothesis that a dual-domain mass transfer approach can provide an
              effective representation of such characteristics.

Four specific elements are
              integrated into the proposed research.  (1) Generate 3-D geologically plausible
              networks of dm-scale fluvially deposited channels and simulate detailed
              transport in such systems.  (2) Assess the ability of the dual-domain mass
              transfer model, and possibly other alternative models, to represent the key
              characteristics of solute transport. (3) Conduct a series of large-diameter
              column experiments to measure the mass transfer model parameter values under
              different heterogeneity configurations and flow rates.  (4) Conduct tracer
              tests at the MADE site to obtain the mass transfer model parameter values,
              using dye-tracing, soil coring and image analysis aimed at providing direct
              field evidence of preferential flow paths.  We will attempt to relate the
              lithologic characteristics to the mass transfer model parameters obtained from
              the tracer tests.
