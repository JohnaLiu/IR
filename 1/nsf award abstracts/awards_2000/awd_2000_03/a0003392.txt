Abstract    :
              This workshop takes Alaska Native students attending the College of Rural Alaska
              to an international forum to present their own research on arctic economies,
              self-government arrangements, and environmental management practices.  They
              will meet other students, faculty and staff from circumpolar universities and
              establish a researech network for indigenous students in the arctic.
