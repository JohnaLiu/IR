This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              in chemistry involves Richard J. Saykally of the University of California at
              Berkeley and Claude LeForestier at the Universite de Montpellier II in
              Montpellier, France.  The objective of their collaboration is to construct and
              deliver an accurate and generally applicable force field for describing liquid
              and solid water. Experimental studies of water clusters by laser vibration
              rotation tunneling (VRT) infrared (IR) cavity will be conducted by the Berkeley
              group.  The Montpellier group will focus on theoretical descriptions of water
              dimer and trimer spectra. The US group brings to this collaboration
              experimental capabilities in terahertz VRT and IR spectroscopy.  This is
              complemented by French theoretical expertise in Wigner pseudospectral method
              and vibrational predissociation. 

This award represents the US side of a
              joint proposal to NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research
              (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US
              investigator and graduate students. The CNRS will support the visits of French
              researchers to the United States. The collaboration addresses an important
              scientific question - the accurate determination of water's intermolecular
              potential.  The project will advance fundamental understanding of the water
              force field.
