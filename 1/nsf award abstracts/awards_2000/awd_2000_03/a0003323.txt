This award to Texas A&M University will provide support for a
              workshop to evaluate technology required to operate drill systems in the marine
              environment, and particularly "robotic" systems that may be operated off of
              ships in the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System fleet, thus
              not requiring a separate, large drilling platform.  The workshop will include
              scientists and engineers, and will take place in late 2000, with report to be
              published in mid-2001.
