The University of Maryland will continue their studies of
              the high magnetic latitude ionosphere and magnetosphere using galactic radio
              noise absorption techniques (riometry).  Several years ago, they developed a
              new imaging riometers are now being operated at Iqaluit, Canada;
              Sondestromfjord, Greenland; South Pole, McMurdo and in all six of the Automatic
              Geophysical Observatories (AGO) operated by NSF in Antarctica.  Additionally,
              they are operating broad beam riometers at Iqaluit, McMurdo and South Pole as
              well as auroral photometers at McMurdo and South Pole.  They have also provided
              imaging riometers for the British Halley Bay and the Australian Davis stations,
              both in Antaractica, thus considerably extending coverage.  In the next few
              years they will also build imaging riometers systems for some of the British
              AGOs.  The instruments work synergistically with a number of other instruments
              which are operated at all of these sites by other investigators.
