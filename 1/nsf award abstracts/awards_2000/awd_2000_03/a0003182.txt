Abstract    :
              The investigators will deploy a meteor radar system at the Maui Space
              Surveillance Site near the summit of Haleakala, Hawaii, to study the spectrum
              of wind and temperature variability in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. 
              Continuous wind and temperature measurements provided by the meteor radar are
              crucial for interpreting the simultaneous airglow and lidar observations.  In
              addition, the meteor radar observations of winds and temperatures combined with
              high resolution lidar measurements of temperatures will make it possible to
              characterize tidal oscillations in both the wind and temperature field and
              their seasonal variations.  The meteor radar will measure the background wind
              field necessary to determine the periods of wind-shifted observed waves, and
              assess the role of instrumental filtering in the presence of variable wind
              shifting of the wave spectrum when interpreting statistical summaries of wave
              properties produced by the optical instruments.  The effort will take advantage
              of the unique opportunity provided by the collocation of the sodium Doppler
              lidar and meteor radar to validate and refine the newly developed meteor radar
              and temperature measurement technique.  This new technique offers the potential
              for continuous long-term monitoring of temperatures for investigations of the
              secular, annual, and tidal variations of the temperature field in the mesopause
              region.
