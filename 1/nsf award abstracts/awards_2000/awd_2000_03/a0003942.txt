With National Science Foundation
              support, Drs. Cynthia Fox and Jane Smith will conduct three years of linguistic
              research on a unique variety of French. This language was brought to the
              northeastern part of the United States by French Canadian immigrants from
              Quebec and Acadians from the Maritimes over a period from the end of the 18th
              century into the 20th. These Franco-Americans constitute a significant segment
              of the populations of the northeastern states. Thanks to an ideology that
              supported the preservation of their ancestral heritage, they represent the
              second largest concentration of French speakers in the United States. But in
              the past 40 years, both the number of these French speakers and the frequency
              of their use of French have declined dramatically. Two goals of this project
              are to collect a sample of Franco-American French and to study its current
              vitality. Interviews with Franco-Americans in Maine, Massachusetts, New
              Hampshire, Connecticut, and Rhode Island will be recorded. These data will
              address several interrelated questions: (1) How does this variety of French
              differ from the French spoken in Canada? (2) How did these differences come
              about? For example, how has English influenced this variety of French? (3) Does
              this French vary across communities? (4) What factors have led some
              Franco-Americans to keep using their French and others to stop using it?
              

Answers to such questions improve scientific understanding of the complex
              ways that languages and their speakers change over time and geography. This
              research thus has both historical and linguistic value. The project will also
              provide training for future researchers by involving students in all phases and
              in a unique partnership between the State University of New York at Albany and
              the University of Maine. Of greatest importance, this research project will
              involve community members in documenting and thus helping to preserve their
              linguistic heritage.
