Abstract    :
              Dr. Shabazz began his graduate teaching career at Atlanta University (now a part
              of Clark Atlanta University) in 1957, where he found only two students pursuing
              master's degrees in mathematics.  During the next six years, he recruited and
              graduated 109 students with master's degrees in mathematics.  Of this group, 30
              went on to earn doctoral degrees from some of the Nation's leading
              universities.  In 1986, Dr. Shabazz returned to join the faculty at Clark
              Atlanta University.  Within six years, 155 undergraduate students were majoring
              in mathematics at Clark Atlanta University.  Nineteen former students of Dr.
              Shabazz are currently doctoral candidates in mathematics.  Dr. Shabazz recently
              returned to his alma mater, Lincoln University, where he continues to teach and
              mentor.
