 This proposal is aimed at
              producing a volatile mass balance for the Central American subduction zone by
              quantifying the contributions from the subducting slab, mantle wedge and
              overlying crust to the overall arc budget. The Central American arc was chosen
              because it possess a number of unique features which allow explicit linkages to
              be forged between systematic variations in volcanic output and variations in
              subduction parameters, specifically slab dip, sediment supply and crustal
              thickness.  Our approach is to couple CO2 and helium measurements (isotopes and
              relative abundances) which allows for identification and quantitative
              assessment of the various contributors to the magmatic output.  Although a
              powerful technique, the accuracy of any flux estimates is limited by
              uncertainties in the effects of magmatic degassing on resultant CO2/3He ratios
              and on assumptions on the isotopic and abundance characteristics assigned to
              potential endmember compositions involved in arc magmagenesis.  By analyzing
              and comparing the CO2-He relationships in geothermal fluids with mafic minerals
              both along and across the Central America arc, we aim to explore the extent of
              these limitations and to assess approaches with the potential to circumvent any
              difficulties. Additionally, we will derive present-day CO2 fluxes through
              combined COSPEC and gas chemistry studies.  This offers the further possibility
              of deriving absolute fluxes for N2 and H2O and for also constraining their
              provenance in the subduction zone factory.
