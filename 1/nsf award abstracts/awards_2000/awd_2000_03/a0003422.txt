Abstract    :
              The Vermont Center for the Book is developing "Mother Goose Cares about Math and
              Science," an integrated curriculum of science process skills and
              standards-based mathematics concepts for preschool children.  A college credit
              course will be developed for childcare providers based on this curriculum.  The
              course increases science and math literacy and the ability to incorporate NCTM
              standards, and science process skills, into daily interactions with children. 
              Participants are also provided with the tools to communicate the importance of
              these concepts to parents.  The course will be delivered to 600 childcare
              workers in Vermont and inner-city Philadelphia over a three-year period. 
              Recruitment will include providers in center-, home- and school-based settings
              in both urban and rural communities.  Participants will be provided with books,
              Curriculum Guides, tools and manipulatives needed to implement the course
              pedagogy.  Materials to be developed include a seven-segment training, which
              will be used to disseminate the project nationally. Participants will receive a
              comprehensive training package that can be used to train their peers.
