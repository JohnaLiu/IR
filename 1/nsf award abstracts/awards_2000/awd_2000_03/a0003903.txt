Abstract    :
              The Snow Petrel, Pagadroma nivea, is an abundant seabird species that occurs
              only in pack-ice covered seas of the Southern Ocean and nests among talus
              slopes of ice-free nanataks.  It has been shown that at some ice-free locations
              this species has nested for 35,000 years.  The proposed project will focus on
              the isotopic analysis of laminated deposits of Snow Petrel 'mumiyo' (i.e.,
              stomach oil that accumulates around nesting cavities) dating back 10,000 years
              before present.  The samples are in hand and were collected at the Bunger
              Hills, East Antarctica.  These analyses will assess the variation in the
              structure of certain portions of the upper food web of the Southern Ocean in
              response to climate variation.  Profiles of 18O and 2H will be analyzed to
              reveal correspondence to long-term fluctuations in marine climate, while 13C
              and 15N will be used to assess food web fluctuations.  The Snow Petrel feeds on
              either krill, at one trophic level, or fish, at the next highest.  Thus results
              may reveal long-term switches in diet as a function of availability in these
              two classes of prey.  Availability of these prey to Snow Petrels is in turn
              known to be affected by the variation in sea ice cover.  Sea ice cover varies
              with climate, as revealed in sediment cores of coastal Antarctica.  The
              proposed analyses have the potential to reveal corresponding changes in higher
              in the food web.
