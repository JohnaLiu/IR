	The proposed research will result in a high-resolution
              (meter-scale) d13C stratigraphy for nearly 1.3 km of Carboniferous limestones
              exposed in the Arrow Canyon Range in southeastern Nevada.  The Arrow Canyon
              Range has served a global reference section for the Carboniferous as a result
              of nearly 40 years of detailed work by academic, industry and government
              geologists.  However, little geochemistry has been done to this point that can
              be used to address global processes (e.g., carbon cycling, continental
              weathering).  The Mississippian samples for the carbon isotope curve will come
              from a section at Tungsten Gap and the Pennsylvanian portion will come from the
              section at Arrow Canyon.  The two sections are essentially unfaulted and
              separated by less than 10 km along strike.  Previous work has produced a
              detailed biostratigraphic framework for both sections using conodont and
              foraminifers, which will allow for the placement of the carbon isotope curve
              within a zonal time scale.   Previous carbon isotope study in the Lower
              Mississippian portion of the Arrow Canyon succession has revealed
              well-preserved trends that can be correlated on a regional to global scale,
              indicating that the Arrow Canyon Range is well-suited for a detailed
              geochemical investigation. Carboniferous formations in the Arrow Canyon Range
              are almost entirely limestone, and make up an upward-shallowing succession
              during the Mississippian and at least two transgressive-regressive cycles,
              including cyclothemic deposition, during the Pennsylvanian. The carbon isotope
              curve will be integrated with similar data sets generated for the Carboniferous
              elsewhere in North America and Europe in order to test hypotheses about global
              changes in organic carbon burial rates and riverine weathering fluxes during a
              Greenhouse to Icehouse transition.
