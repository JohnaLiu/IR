The focus of this project is laboratory measurements of
              sound velocities and elastic moduli of oxide minerals under the actual pressure
              and temperature (P and T) conditions of the Earth's deep interior. This project
              involves several related activities: 1) The development of an apparatus to
              measure sound velocities at ultra-high P-T conditions. The apparatus will be
              based on CO2 laser heating of samples while they are pressurized in a diamond
              anvil cell. Sound velocities will be measured by Brillouin scattering. Our goal
              is to measure the velocities of minerals up to T=2500 K and P=50 GPa, which
              spans the P-T conditions to a depth of ~1300 km. 2) Velocity measurements at
              high pressure only, at high temperature only, and at simultaneous P-T
              conditions using a resistively-heated diamond-anvil cell (where the temperature
              is moderate but accurately known). This will identify the separate effects of P
              and T on velocities, and help characterize conditions under laser heating.  3)
              Thermal expansion measurements using synchrotron x-radiation. Initial
              experiments will involve MgO, a lower mantle constituent. We will assess the
              precision and accuracy of the measurements, thermal stresses, and deviatoric
              stresses in the pressure medium. We will then study likely constituents of the
              Earth's mantle, chosen from: olivine and its high pressure polymorphs beta- and
              gamma-(Mg,Fe)2SiO4, majorite-garnet solid solutions, pyroxenes,
              magnesium-silicate perovskites, and hydrous phases. Comparisons of our results
              with seismologically-determined velocities for the Earth will be used to
              improve our understanding of the chemical and thermal state of the Earth's
              interior.
