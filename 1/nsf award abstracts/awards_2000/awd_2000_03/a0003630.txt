Abstract    :
              The Independence Seaport Museum will create "Boat Building:  Art and Science," a
              3,000-square foot permanent exhibit that is designed to educate visitors about
              the science of boat building and design.  Concepts such as buoyancy, water
              displacement, turbulence and drag will be explored through interactives,
              maritime artifacts, models and oral histories of tradesmen.  By using the
              principles identified by the Family Science Learning Research Project of the
              Philadelphia/Camden Informal Science Education Collaborative (PISEC), the
              exhibit will be user-friendly for families with young children.  Visitor
              workstation topics may include boat building, floating, buoyancy, sails, wind
              and boat shape.  Visitors will use science processes while learning through
              open-ended play and exploration.  Creative programs for families and school
              groups, as well as curriculum materials will support the exhibit.  A website
              and technical training manual will also be produced.  Four phases of evaluation
              are planned, and include front-end analysis which will incorporate focus groups
              with children ages 7-12, and formative evaluation using prototypes of
              interactives.  Remedial evaluation will be carried out once the exhibit opens,
              and summative evaluation will use tracking and exit interviews to assess
              learning and understanding.  The estimated annual audience of over 130,000
              visitors will be expanded by replicating and traveling various components to
              other maritime museums in partnership with the Association of Science and
              Technology Centers.  Evaluation of traveling components will also be undertaken
              to determine if they present an appropriate model for maritime-based
              exhibits.
