This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration involves
              George Kukla of Columbia University's Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory and
              Denis-Didier Rousseau of the University of Montpellier II.  They propose to
              study abrupt climate shifts during the declining phase of the last
              interglacial.  Between about 120 and 105 thousand years ago the climate of the
              Earth which was similar to today moved into a glacial state.  The mechanism of
              this transition still remains unknown.  The investigators will study in detail
              how fast the environment changed during that time in Western Europe.  They will
              analyze thin sediment cores from lake beds of La Grande Pile in France.  The US
              and French investigators bring to this collaboration complementary expertise
              and will conduct joint mineralogical, geochemical and palynological
              investigations of these cores currently stored in France. 

This award
              represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National
              Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living
              expenses for the US investigator.  CNRS will support the visits of French
              researchers to the United States. The collaboration will advance fundamental
              understanding of the causes of climate transition, and provide information on
              natural climate variability on  long-time scales.
