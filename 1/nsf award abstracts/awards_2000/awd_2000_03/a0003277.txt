Abstract    :
              The grant provides funding to cover participant costs and support costs for a
              workshop to identify research issues and opportunities in the area of
              electronic product realization.  In e-product realization, customers
              participate in the product design process.  This workshop will bring together
              about 50 researchers and practitioners from the field to discuss current issues
              and impediments to development of the field.  The workshop will produce a white
              paper detailing the workshop findings and presenting a suggested research
              agenda.

E-product realization is an emerging practice in engineering design
              and product realization that gives customers freedom and access to obtain
              products that are more suited to them as individuals.  This is an emerging area
              of product design and realization, and one that holds the potential to become a
              major segment of product realization in the future.  This workshop could
              provide the basis for NSF funding in this area.
