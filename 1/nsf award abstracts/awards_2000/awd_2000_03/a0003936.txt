Abstract    :
              This collaborative research project with Lynn Russell, Princeton University, is
              an investigation of the role of organic species in atmospheric particles. 
              Measurements of aerosol organics in east Asian outflow will be made from
              shipboard (NOAA R/V Brown) and aircraft (NCAR C-130), during the ACE-Asia field
              program.  The measurements include: 1) semi-continuous elemental/organic carbon
              (EC/OC) analysis using a thermo-optical detection technique, and 2)
              time-integrated filter samples for analysis by Fourier Transform Infrared
              spectroscopy.  The EC/OC measurements provide an important indicator for the
              role of combustion emissions in the air masses sampled.  The FTIR organic
              analyses describe the mass of organic species and classify those species by
              functional group and solubility in solvents of different polarity.  This
              provides information about the mass fraction of organic compounds that are
              water-soluble and contribute to enhanced water uptake by particles.  The
              hydrophobic organic fraction that does not dissolve in the particulate aqueous
              phase will also be quantified.
