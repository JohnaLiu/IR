Abstract    :
              This project investigates the parental logic, goals and decision making
              processes behind child welfare outcomes in Thailand from a bio-cultural
              evolutionary perspective.  The dissertation research by a cultural
              anthropologist from the University of Washington will ascertain the
              characteristics of children at high risk for potentially hazardous welfare
              outcomes, and will clarify the causal pathways by which cultural, ecological,
              and biological factors interact to produce parental decisions.  The project
              will compare patterns of investment in and labor extraction from children from
              different village and household types, investigate the cultural logic behind
              parental decision making, and study the implications for child welfare and
              parental reproductive success.  Ethnographic interviewing and focus groups will
              provide qualitative insights into the motivations and intentions associated
              with parental strategizing and parental expectations of sons and daughters. 
              Retrospective family history surveys will quantitatively explore household
              decision making focusing on five specific child welfare outcomes.  The new
              knowledge from this project will be valuable to development policy planners,
              will advance our understanding of demographic transition theory, will help
              train a young social scientist, and will advance our knowledge of this
              important region of the world.
