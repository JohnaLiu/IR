Abstract    :
              
The Northern California Rural Systemic Initiative (NCRSI) is a systemic
              change
effort undertaken by a consortium of universities, school districts,
              parents, students,
nonprofit organizations, government agencies and businesses
              that addresses the
barriers to adequate science, mathematics and technology
              education in rural Northern
California. Grounded in the belief that effective
              uses of new technologies to enhance
student learning require new pedagogical
              skills and curricular content, the consortium
seeks to transform mathematics
              and science education by introducing comprehensive
changes in pedagogy
              including instruction and curriculum. NCRSI consists of the
following three
              core elements:

1. An in-depth self-study of Modoc and Siskiyou counties
              including the collection of
base-line data on mathematics, science and
              technology instruction;

2. An innovative preservice and inservice teacher
              and administrator preparation
model, Guiding Partners, which incorporates
              mathematics, science, technology
Training and development of constructivist
              based pedagogy skills centered
Around a concept of project facilitation - the
              pedagogy will be modeled by
Consortium staff developers and university faculty
              as they teach it to classroom
Teachers who will practice it with students in
              K-12 fieldwork;

3. Development of a five year implementation plan based upon
              the in-depth study of
Mathematics, science and technology instruction - the
              plan will include specific,
Measurable outcomes, timelines, and designate
              responsibilities.
