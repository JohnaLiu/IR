Despite the development of an impressive GPS infrastructure
              for precise orbit determination and many advances in GPS modeling and analysis
              techniques, significant error sources remain.  As continuously operating GPS
              arrays continue to be deployed throughout the world to study geophysical
              processes with signals below 1 mm/yr, the need to eliminate all systematic
              errors is critical.   Multipath represents one of the largest errors in GPS
              applications today. There is currently no standard technique to remove
              multipath errors in high precision GPS software used by the geophysics
              community.  Failure to correct for the multipath environment at a GPS site
              produces a time-varying systematic error in GPS estimates which degrades the
              accuracy of the system.

Support form this grant will be used to develop an
              approach for correcting GPS multipath errors that borrows on technologies
              developed by aerospace engineers for spacecraft attitude determination.  The
              technique uses the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to estimate corrections to the
              GPS phase observables.  Although routinely collected by GPS receivers, SNR data
              are not currently used in high precision GPS software.  This SNR based
              multipath correction technique can be used both on older datasets as well as
              new GPS data.  And because the technique uses SNR data collected simultaneously
              with the phase data, it is sensitive to time varying changes at GPS sites.
