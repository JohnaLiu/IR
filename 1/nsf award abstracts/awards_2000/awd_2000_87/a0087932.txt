Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)
The purpose of this project is to implement a discovery-based
              approach in the chemistry laboratory curriculum through the vertical
              integration of molecular spectroscopy. Six experiments that utilize
              ultraviolet-visible or fluorescence spectroscopy are being adapted to
              incorporate the active learning strategies of various NSF-funded initiatives.
              These experiments are introduced into general, organic, and advanced chemistry
              laboratory courses. By building upon their experiences and knowledge for each
              successive experiment, students are exposed to molecular spectroscopy
              techniques and their concepts consistently throughout their college careers.
              This vertical integration approach allows students to retain their knowledge of
              molecular spectroscopy concepts and empower them to apply this knowledge to a
              variety of scientific applications and problems.
