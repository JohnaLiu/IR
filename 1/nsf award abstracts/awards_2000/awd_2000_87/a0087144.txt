This award supports the study the glacial history of Ridge AB
              in West Antarctica using well-established geophysical methods. Our study is
              motivated by the need to improve under-standing of how the configuration and
              activity of the West Antarctic drainage system is changing, and how this
              affects the stability of the ice sheet. Ridge AB has been chosen for several
              reasons: 1) previous studies of inter-stream ridges in West Antarctica have
              revealed much information about the history of the surrounding ice streams.
              There is an "information-hole" in the southern sector of the ice sheet; we are
              optimistic that our study of Ridge AB will reveal new information about recent
              changes in the configuration and activity of Ice Streams A
and B; 2) geologic
              evidence from Reedy Glacier indicates that ice in the vicinity of Ridge AB was
              ~700 m thicker during the last glacial maximum. This helps constrain the
              magnitude of
thinning that has occurred through the Holocene, and opens the
              possibility of linking the
history of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to the
              geologic record in the Trans-Antarctic Mountains.  Our approach is to first map
              spatial variations of internal layering, buried crevasses, surface velocity,
              and accumulation rate. The main investigative tools are: high and low-frequency
              radar systems, GPS surveying methods, and short (20 m) firn cores. The
              diagnostic measurements will then be examined with ice flow models to infer the
              glacial history of Ridge AB and the surrounding ice streams. The history will
              be interpreted in context of the histories that are emerging from the other
              inter-ice stream ridges, as well as the geologic evidence from Reedy and other
              outlet glaciers in the Trans-Antarctic Mountains. Our overall goal is to
              improve understanding of the evolution of the WAIS drainage system.
