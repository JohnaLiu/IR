Abstract    :
              This project will continue the analysis of data obtained by a network of
              autonomous magnetometers deployed on the Antarctic continent by the British
              Antarctic Survey (BAS).  The magnetometers provide information on the
              interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's magnetic field, an area of
              research that is particularly important in the context of space weather, and
              the effect of solar events on the operation of satellites and ground-based
              electronic systems.  The data analysis will be a joint project among scientists
              at Augsburg College, the University of New Hampshire, and at BAS and will focus
              especially on ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves and increases in the solar wind
              dynamic pressure, and dawn-side events apparently related to the injection of
              ions from the magnetotail.  Studies of irregular ULF waves, especially during
              magnetic storms and substorm periods are a further area of interest.  These
              analysis efforts are highly suitable for undergraduate research participation
              and build on currently strong programs of faculty and student research.
