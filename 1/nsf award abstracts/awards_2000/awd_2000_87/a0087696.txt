Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Iowa State University, Charles Glatz, Principal
              Investigator, for a three-year Combined Research-Curriculum Development award
              entitled, "NSF CRCD: Chemicals from Biorenewables."
This project will provide
              a unique and valuable experience for students by giving them an opportunity to
              work in multidisciplinary teams on cutting-edge problems involving
              biorenewables, while using novel problem-based learning approaches.  The focus
              of this project will be on bringing important emergent areas from the
              development of biorenewable sources of chemicals into new and existing courses
              in the Chemical Engineering curriculum and to let students experience the
              differences between process and product development.  The new material will be
              added mainly as a laboratory component offered in parallel with three existing
              and one new lecture course.  The educational approach will be one of
              problem-based learning in multidisciplinary teams.
