Abstract    :
              This project seeks funds to begin serious planning for a fifth international
              study of mathematics and science to be conducted by the IEA.  Boston College
              directors, Ina Mullus and Michael Martin, would begin planning meetings and
              discussions that would lead toward a reconceptualization of the frameworks for
              the assessments in mathematics and science that make up the Third International
              Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).  The experience of the previous 2
              assessments, and the needs of policy makers would be discussed at these
              meetings.  The study would be enhanced to address leading issues in mathematics
              and science education.  These plans would cumulate into a study to be conducted
              in 2003 or after.
