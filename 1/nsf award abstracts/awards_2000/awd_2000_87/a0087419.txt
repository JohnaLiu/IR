Abstract    :
                 Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on
              the
interactions of heavy quarks, namely charm, beauty and top quarks.
              Among
the central mysteries of the so-called Standard Model of
              Elementary
Particle Physics are the questions of how the basic constituents of
              matter
-- namely quarks and electrons -- acquire their masses and why they
              come
in so-called families, which are exact replications of each other
              except
for their masses. The mystery of the mass generation process can
              be
studied in the most sensitive way by studying limitations of time
              reversal
invariance. Violations of this invariance are also an essential
              ingredient
when one tries to understand the observed preponderance of matter
              over
antimatter in the universe as a dynamically generated feature rather
              than
as an arbitrary initial condition.
   The goal of this research is to
              calibrate and refine the theoretical
tools needed for a proper and accurate
              interpretation of heavy-quark data
which bear on the mysteries of the origin
              of mass and of violations of
time reversal invariance.
