This award supports a project to examine and compare high
              resolution methane concentration and isotopic histories during the last
              millennium from the Law Dome ice core in coastal Antarctica.  Atmospheric
              methane is an important chemical component of both the stratosphere and
              troposphere, and is a major contributor to the anthropogenic enhancement of the
              greenhouse effect.  Quantifying the budget of methane has proven difficult
              because of the wide range of sources and locations from which it is emitted. 
              Measurements of the atmospheric concentration and the carbon isotopic
              composition of methane have enabled a greater understanding of the controls
              over the modern methane budget.  Studies of the methane budget prior to and
              during industrialization and the emergence of large human populations can help
              in the understanding of the controls on this budget.  Measurements of the
              carbon-13:carbon 12 ratio and of the carbon isotopic composition (d 13C) of
              methane in air from the last millenium trapped in polar ice will be made to aid
              in understanding of the paleo-methane budget.  This is a collaborative effort
              between the stable isotope laboratory and the University of Colorado and the
              New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, the
              Australian Antarctic program and the NOAA carbon cycle group.  The Australian
              and New Zealand groups will provide the ice and past results of Antarctic firn
              air measurements and the stable isotope lab will provide expertise on isotopic
              measurements of very small firn air samples.  The carbon cycle group will
              assist in the calibration of standards and analysis of firn air samples.  All
              groups will participate in the modeling and interpretation of results.
