Abstract    :
              Computer Science (31) This project develops innovative new laboratory materials
              that give students hands-on experience with wireless networking concepts and
              technology. The underlying hardware for student projects is the Cybiko, an
              inexpensive yet powerful multi-functional communications computer. The
              resulting materials can be used to augment existing computer networks courses,
              as several of the exercises illustrate traditional networking concepts, or they
              can form the core of a new upper-level wireless networking course. The
              tremendous growth of the internet, in both size and significance, makes it
              increasingly important that undergraduate students be exposed to fundamental
              networking technologies and techniques.
