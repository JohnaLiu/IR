Abstract    :
              The MIT Media Laboratory, in collaboration with six museums, will develop the
              "Playful Invention and Exploration (PIE) Network," with the goal of engaging a
              broader audience in science inquiry and engineering by enabling more people to
              create, invent and explore with new digital technologies.  PIE museums will
              integrate the latest MIT technologies and educational research into their
              ongoing public programs.  The museums will organize MindFest events, modeled
              after a two-day event at MIT in 1999, at which youth, educators, artists,
              engineers, hobbyists and researchers came together to collaborate on invention
              projects. The PIE Network will disseminate PIE ideas and activities to
              educators and families nationally.
