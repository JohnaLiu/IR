This is a one-year cooperative proposal between Dr. Bruce
              Jayne of the University of Cincinnati and Dr. Harold Voris of the Chicago Field
              Museum of Natural History, and Dr. Peter Ng of the National University of
              Singapore and Dr. Vachira Lehknim of the Prince of Songkal University,
              Thailand.  They proposed to study aquatic and marine snake species in the Malay
              Peninsula to relating morphological diversity to foraging ecology.   The Malay
              Peninsula has a unique high diversity of aquatic and marine snakes.  It is an
              area well suited to this study.  This is also an important scientific question
              in ecology.  The result of this study has a broad impact on the understanding
              of the integration of organismal design with the environment.  The U.S.
              researchers are experts in this area and well suited to carry out this study. 
              They will also provide seminars to introduce comparative functional studies to
              their colleagues in Thailand and Singapore.  This is a relatively uncommon
              approach to scientists in Southeast Asia, but could be important in the
              understanding of evolutionary changes in morphology and performance in diverse
              tropical systems.  The Thailand Research Council and the NSF jointly support
              this project.
