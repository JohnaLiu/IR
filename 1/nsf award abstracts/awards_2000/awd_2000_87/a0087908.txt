Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)

The objective of this proposal is to improve the success of
              UVI students in their first two years of chemistry by creating laboratory
              environments that interest and intrigue students, that give them
              individualized, real-world laboratory projects, that create a sense of what
              chemists do and the tools they use, and that instill professional behaviors and
              attitudes. Students formerly saw the laboratory portion of these courses as a
              series of isolated experiences culminating in calculation and reporting
              exercises that were barriers to overcome. The students often placed little
              importance on what they were doing and did not develop any sense of the nature
              of real investigation. Faculty in the Department of Chemistry are adapting and,
              with appropriate modifications, implementing the innovative laboratory
              curriculum developed at Hampden Sydney College. The UVI chemistry curriculum
              now focuses on exposing all chemistry students, including Freshmen, to extended
              and individualized research experiences using a full range of appropriate
              chemical techniques including instrumental techniques.
