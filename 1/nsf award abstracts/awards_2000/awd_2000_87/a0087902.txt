Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Texas Tech University under the direction of Dr.
              Shubhra Gangopadhyay, for the support of a Combined Research-Curriculum
              Development project entitled, "Curriculum Development for the Design,
              Fabrication, and Utilization of Chip-Based Micro-Analytical Systems."  This
              project will involve the development of curriculum in micro devices and micro
              sensors geared towards providing both undergraduate and graduate students with
              as much hands-on and real-world experience as possible.  The three-semester
              sequence will include a semester on the basics of Microsystems and the
              techniques of microfabrication.  The second semester would be an in-depth look
              at a few Microsystems with an emphasis on gaining understanding through
              modeling and in-depth process understanding.  The third semester would give
              students the opportunity to design, build, and test their own Microsystem.
