Abstract    :
              " LTER Cross site 2000: Interactions between climate and nutrient cycling in
              Arctic and Subarctic tundras"

The proposed project would continue a long
              history of arctic ecosystem science by the PI and collaborators. The climate of
              high latitude ecosystems strongly limits the inputs and turnover of essential
              elements like N and P.  The broad aims of this research are to: 1) improve
              understanding of the causes and consequences of variability in climate-nutrient
              interactions  and in the availability and plant uptake of N and P among
              contrasting arctic and Subarctic tundra ecosystems and 2) to apply this
              understanding to better develop large-area, long-term predictions of their
              responses to climate change.  The research will compare ecosystems at two
              sites: Abisko in Sweden and Toolik Lake in Alaska.  The proposed work involves:
              two workshops focused on comparisons at the sties; field research on N and P
              turnover in soil, plant microbe interactions, and amino acid uptake; and
              modeling of primary production, biomass accumulation, and organic matter
              turnover.  The new experimental component of the project includes a deeper
              examination of the importance of organic N uptake by arctic vegetation and
              extends many ongoing measurements to the "tails" of the growing season during
              which time there is indication of important, but previously under appreciated
              biological activity.
