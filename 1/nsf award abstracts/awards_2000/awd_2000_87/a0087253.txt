"Ecological stoichiometry of North American
              grassland grasshoppers (Acrididae) along a latitudinal gradient"

Insect
              herbivores in grassland ecosystems encounter widely varying food quality
              embedded in a variable mosaic of primary production, plant species composition
              and nutrient dynamics.  The PI's asked: how similar or how different are the
              underlying processes mediating these interactions in southern arid grassland
              compared to northern mixed-grass prairie? Do patterns associated with larger
              scales provide insight that cannot be obtained by studying a single or nearby
              grasslands? As dominant and diverse aboveground herbivores, grasshoppers are an
              excellent model insect herbivore to evaluate these processes for a wide array
              of native North American grasslands. The PI will examine constraints on
              grasshopper secondary production resulting from limiting nutrients across
              twelve sites ranging from arid grasslands in Texas to New Mexico, through a
              highly dynamic mid-continent set of sites comprising tallgrass, shortgrass and
              mixed grass prairies in Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado and Nebraska until northern
              mixed grass systems in South Dakota and Canada are encountered.  Four LTER
              sites will be included in this transect (Jornada, Sevilleta, Shortgrass Steppe
              and Konza Prairie).

Ecological stoichiometry provides the primary conceptual
              framework for addressing these key issues, employing the principle of mass
              balance to account for the regulation of limiting elements in their transfer
              between trophic levels.  This research will examine stoichiometric elemental
              ratios (C:N:P) as a constraint on secondary production in grasshoppers.  A
              series of predictions will be tested using C:N:P ratios of common grasshopper
              species, ingested food and grass from each of twelve sites.  Sites that
              manipulate food quality with large experiments (fire, grazing and/or nutrient
              additions) provide an opportunity to better identify causal
              relationships.
