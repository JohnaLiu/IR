Abstract    :
              PI's objective is to develop a high-throughput screening method to efficiently
              measure and characterize the growth of viruses in cell culture. He plans to
              evaluate the feasibility of his approach. His approach is based on the idea
              that (1) viruses confined to grow into linear arrays of host cells will spread
              at velocities that are useful traits of the specific virus-host pair and (2)
              the spatial distribution of virus and host components in such propagating
              infections can reflect characteristic stages of the infection process. More
              specific aims are to: (1) assess how patterning host-cells affects their
              viability in culture, (2) measure the spatial distribution of markers for
              specific early and late components, (3) test whether localized initiations of
              infection into patterned cells can be used to increase the amount of
              information that a single sample yields, and (4) evaluate how the patterning of
              host cells influences viral growth.
