Volcanic eruptions are driven by the growth of gas
              bubbles.  Many models suggest that magmas either erupt explosively or effuse as
              lava, depending on the magma's ability to degas efficiently, which is
              controlled by the melt transferring gas to bubbles.  If bubbles and melt fail
              fall out of equilibrium, over-pressure develops and fragments the magma. 
              Despite the central role that gas bubbles play in volcanism, experimental work
              has only recently begun to address their growth in silicate melts.  This
              project addresses the dynamics of bubble growth in silicate melts through
              detailed analysis of the rates of bubble growth and equilibrium between bubbles
              and melt as a function of pressure drop.  Controlled hydrothermal experiments
              will be used to impose variable decompression histories on gas-melt systems in
              order to examine how bubbles grow and at what rates of pressure decrease do
              bubbles-melt fail to remain in equilibrium.  These data are crucial in
both
              understanding of eruption dynamics and developing better modeling of conduit
              flow in eruptions.  Experiments will be performed in the Experimental Petrology
              Laboratory at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and all products will be
              analyzed in the Advanced Instrumentation Laboratory at the University of Alaska
              Fairbanks.
