Title: Developing comprehensive
              three-dimensional fault models and simulating
seismic wave propagation
              generated by these earthquake sources

This project aims to develop three-dimensional structural models
              of active fault systems in the Los Angeles basin to study earthquake behavior.
              The models will incorporate large amounts of formerly proprietary subsurface
              geophysical data, including seismic reflection profiles and well logs, that
              were acquired by the petroleum industry. These data, combined with earthquake
              seismicity, will define the positions and geometries of faults at depth. The
              models will include both strike-slip and blind-thrust fault systems, both of
              which are capable of generating destructive earthquakes. Geodetic observations
              (GPS and InSAR) will be compared with fault displacements to assess the
              accuracy of modeled fault shapes and slip rates. The new models will be used to
              examine the mechanical interactions of fault systems in Los Angeles including
              stress-triggering phenomena. This behavior suggests that major earthquakes on
              one fault can induce events on adjacent faults, thereby increasing seismic
              hazard. Finally, the model will be used to simulate earthquake wave propagation
              from realistic, three-dimensional fault sources for the prediction of hazardous
              ground shaking. Results from these types of simulations can contribute to
              improved earthquake engineering, thereby helping to mitigate these natural
              disasters.
