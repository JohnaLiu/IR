Abstract    :
              In this project, a cross-disciplinary team of the University of Maryland Physics
              Education Research Group (UMD-PERG) and an advisory team of biologists and
              biology-oriented education specialists is carrying out basic research in
              science learning among college-level bioscience students.  An emphasis on
              meta-learning frames the approach of the team.  This includes metacognition,
              epistemologies, expectations, and the construction of broad and powerful mental
              models; in short learning that goes beyond content and helps students
              understand what it means to learn science and how to learn it effectively.  The
              project is studying student learning of fundamental issues in thinking about
              science; modifying current best-practices learning environments to make them
              effective tools for teaching meta-learning in a large-lecture enviornment; and
              developing survey tools to permit the documentation and evaluation of the state
              of student meta-learning attitudes and skills in large classes.  The
              "laboratory" for this research effort is an algebra-based physics course, and
              the project builds on earlier work of the UMD-PERG in studying student
              meta-learning in high school and calculus-based university physics classes.
