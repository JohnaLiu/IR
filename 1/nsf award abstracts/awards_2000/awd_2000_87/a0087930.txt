This award supports a planning visit to Papua New Guinea to
              initiate collaboration with researchers at the Department of Geology at the
              University of Papua New Guinea.  The purpose of this collaboration is to plan
              and conduct research on the paleoclimate records from lake sediments in the
              region.  Funding includes follow-up analyses of core samples in hand, and
              reconnaissance and preliminary coring of new lakes.

The scientific problem
              to be addressed is the sensitivity of the tropical pacific climate system to
              the forcing of the Last Glacial Maximum and the deglaciation 18,000 to 10,000
              years ago.  This is of interest in trying to understand climate variability,
              and particularly the role of the tropical Pacific.
