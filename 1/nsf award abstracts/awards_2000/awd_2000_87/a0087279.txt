This is a proposal to investigate the stability, crystal
              chemistry and equation of state of hydrous spinel and spinelloid phases that
              could occur in the Transition Zone of the mantle (410-670km depth). In
              collaboration with colleagues at the Bavarian Geological Institute (Bayerisches
              Geoinstitut), the investigators will perform synthesis experiments to see if
              spinelloid V may exist in mantle compositions and to better refine the
              pressure-temperature-composition field of spinelloid IV (wadsleyite II).
              Preliminary experiments in hydrous systems have produced crystals of sufficient
              size for single-crystal diffraction methods, so run products will be analyzed
              by this method. They will use single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements in
              the diamond anvil cell (DAC) to measure compressibilities (isothermal bulk
              moduli) and thermal expansion of the hydrous spinelloid observed in these
              experiments. Because the bulk modulus is directly related to seismic velocity,
              if the compressibilities of these phases differ greatly from the anhydrous
              modifications, it may be possible to place some constraint on the amount of OH
              actually present in the minerals of the Transition Zone. Samples will also be
              made available for collaborative studies by various spectroscopic and
              ultrasonic methods.
