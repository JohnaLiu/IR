The elastic behavior of rock and other consolidated
              materials (e.g., concrete) is nonlinear, 

hysteretic, and displays log ( t )
              recovery to stress and temperature perturbations. The physical mechanisms
              causing these unusual behaviors is not understood. It is known, however, that
              the primary elastic properties of a rock are a consequence of the nature of the
              bonds between grains, rather than of the grains themselves. The bond system
              within a rock is highly sensitive to changes in temperature, pore fluid
              configurations, and stress. The goal of this project is to develop an
              experimental system that will allow steady state and transient measurement of
              the elastic tensor of a rock sample in well-defined temperature and saturation
              states. The technique that will be used to determine the elastic tensor of the
              sample is resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS). RUS has recently been shown
              to be an efficient and sensitive measurement technique for rock samples. Thus
              RUS will be used to make a careful exploration of the time, temperature, and
              saturation dependence of elastic behavior in rock. These data will fuel our
              understanding of the microscopic mechanisms driving the behavior of the bond
              system in rock and other consolidated materials, such as concrete.
