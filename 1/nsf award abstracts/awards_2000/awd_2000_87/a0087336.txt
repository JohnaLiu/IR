The goal of this project is to use oxygen isotope
              geochemistry to quantify the temperature of crystallization of coexisting
              aluminum silicates (AS), andalusite, kyanite and sillimanite.  These are
              important index minerals, and their coexistence has been used to infer
              pressure-temperature conditions of metamorphism.  Previous investigations of
              "triple point" localities, defined by the occurrence of all three polymorphs,
              have relied on textural evidence for assessing whether or not the AS minerals
              crystallized in equilibrium.  In this study, the oxygen isotope values of
              quartz and AS minerals from quartzites will be measured in classic triple point
              assemblages from New Mexico in order to address four goals: 1) Determine the
              temperatures of aluminum silicate formation: 2) Evaluate the degree of fluid
              exchange following AS crystallization: 3) Determine whether 'triple point'
              assemblages actually formed over the narrow P-T range defined by the invariant
              equilibrium: 4) Compare the d18O values of sillimanite and fibrolite to better
              understand the temperature interval over which the latter forms.  It is
              envisioned that the study will demonstrate the feasibility of a powerful tool
              for deciphering the timing and temperature of AS crystallization.  This work
              will constitute the work of a Ph.D. student's thesis at the University of New
              Mexico.
