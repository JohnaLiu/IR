Abstract    :
              This project will attempt to combine the excitement and interest students evince
              when allowed to interact with open-ended, exploratory computer models, with the
              structure and explicit pedagogy many require to succeed at linguistically
              oriented, paper-and-pencil tests. Using BioLogica, a software environment we
              have developed on a prior NSF grant, we will present students with a sequence
              of "web labs," or computer-based, guided investigations, that will introduce
              them to multi-level reasoning in the domain of genetics. The web labs will
              provide the students with challenges of increasing difficulty, monitoring their
              work, offering feedback and soliciting responses as appropriate. Each will
              present students with information and questions regarding situations or
              problems analogous to the ones they have just worked on, offering metacognitive
              prompts designed to promote transfer from the computer activities to a broader
              understanding of the underlying scientific concepts
