This is a two-year proposal submitted by Dr. Richard Nader
              and Dr. Emily Ashworth, Texas A & M University, to coordinate the U.S.
              communities involved in the public understanding of science to conduct a
              two-week series of joint dialogues and site visits, in order to: (1) understand
              factors impacting public understanding of science in each of the countries, (2)
              examine current models for achieving public understanding of science, (3)
              discuss the relative effectiveness of various methods, and (4) identify
              priorities for future collaboration on public understanding of science.  The
              U.S. communities involved  in the public understanding of science will then
              host a follow-up workshop in the United States.  The public understanding of
              science is an NSF-wide initiative.  It is also considered important by our
              counterpart countries in East Asia.  The purpose of these workshops is to build
              an agenda for public understanding between the United States and its
              counterpart communities in China and Japan.  The Natural Science Foundation of
              China, the Japan Science and Technology Agency and the NSF jointly support this
              project.
