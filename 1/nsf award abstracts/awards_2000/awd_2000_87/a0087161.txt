This grant provides partial support for the 2000 Gordon
              Research Conference on Photonuclear Reactions, to be held at the Tilton School
              in Tilton, NH, July 30 - August 4.  The structure of the conference encourages
              speakers to minimize review and to maximize information concerning new
              developments in the field. The meeting is especially timely with the rich
              experimental program now underway at Jefferson Laboratory in the United States,
              as well as new results becoming available from other electromagnetic
              accelerator laboratories worldwide.  The funds will be used to support the
              participation of graduate students and junior researchers.
