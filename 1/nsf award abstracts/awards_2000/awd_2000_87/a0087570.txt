Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)

The overarching goal of this proof-of-concept project is the
              design and implementation of a junior-level writing course that is synchronous
              with the proliferation of research opportunities available to today's
              undergraduate science majors. Colleges and universities engage students in
              evermore sophisticated research efforts, yet seldom offer adequate instruction
              in how to communicate these efforts to the larger scientific community. An
              interdisciplinary team-planned/team-taught course is combining the expertise of
              a chemistry professor and an English professor to introduce chemistry majors to
              the genres of scientific writing and associated scientific literacy skills. The
              outcome of the project is a pedagogical approach to scientific writing that
              moves the student beyond generic laboratory reports and develops writing as a
              vehicle for organizing, interpreting, and communicating research data.
              Initiatives in scientific writing, when coupled with initiatives in
              undergraduate research, are ensuring the highest quality education for
              students, and are better preparing science majors for the research and writing
              challenges they will face as career scientists.
