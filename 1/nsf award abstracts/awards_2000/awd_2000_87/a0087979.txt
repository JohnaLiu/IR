Abstract    :
              Computing - Other (35) The interdisciplinary field of computational science
              combines simulation, visualization,
mathematical modeling, programming, data
              structures, networking, database design, symbolic
computation, and high
              performance computing with various scientific disciplines. Despite
              the
shortage of computational scientists, a 1998 survey found only two
              undergraduate special degree
programs and 15 undergraduate courses in the
              field. Unfortunately, few computational science
textbooks are appropriate for
              undergraduate science students.
After extensive discussions on enhancing
              computer use in the sciences, Wofford College
faculty members designed a
              curriculum for students majoring in science or mathematics, called
"Emphasis
              in Computational Science." A student electing this program will complete a
              science
major, two existing courses (Programming in C++, Data Structures), two
              new computational
science courses (Scientific Programming, Data and
              Visualization), and a summer internship.
This project will create, evaluate,
              improve, and expand undergraduate computational
science course modules that
              are rich in applications. These materials will be developed in
collaboration
              with scientists and will be tested and evaluated at several institutions.
              With
dissemination over the World Wide Web, the modules will instruct and
              provide applications that
many institutions can use in a variety of courses.
              The project will provide the materials and will
be a catalyst for improving
              undergraduate computational science education nationally.
