Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21)

This project is improving student learning in
              precalculus and calculus, providing a foundation for further success and
              retention in upper level mathematics and science courses, and enhancing student
              learning outcomes for non-science majors. This addresses four specific
              problems: (1) limited computer laboratory facilities, (2) low student success
              rates in precalculus and calculus, (3) low retention of students in mathematics
              classes, and (4) low enrollment and retention in related science and
              engineering courses. 

The overall objective of this project is to make
              majoring in Science, Math, and Engineering (SME) more accessible through
              improved student learning in precalculus and calculus, thus empowering students
              to succeed when they transfer to four year institutions. To achieve this
              objective the mathematics faculty have established the following goals: (1)
              adaptation and implementation of exemplary educational materials, and proven
              techniques of previously funded National Science Foundation projects especially
              the Connected Curriculum Project and the University of Alabama Integrated
              Mathematics and Science Curriculum; and (2) establishment on one campus of a
              Mathematics Laboratory in which to use these new materials, thus creating an
              effective, interactive learning environment, which also provides Internet
              access for local students.

Activities include the following: (1) requiring
              all students in precalculus and the calculus sequence to enroll in a
              mathematics laboratory semester hour class designed to complete mathematics
              laboratory exercises; (2) enhancing faculty professional development by
              participation in the Duke University Connected Curriculum Project (CCP)
              workshops and by consultation with The University of Alabama to adopt and
              implement effective learning strategies; (3) developing of CCP modules in
              MATHCAD and MATLAB for use in the mathematics laboratory; (4) developing
              Internet courses; and (5) collaborating with faculty on other campuses of the
              college to initiate college wide reform of mathematics education.
