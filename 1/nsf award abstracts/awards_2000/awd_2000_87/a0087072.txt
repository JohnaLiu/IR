Abstract    :
              	Several aspects of tropical dynamics that are still poorly understood are the
              potential vorticity mixing processes in hurricanes and the details of the
              convective-scale generation of potential vorticity in both hurricanes and the
              Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).  Under this award, Dr. Schubert seeks to
              increase dynamical understanding and to improve the accuracy of numerical
              simulations of tropical circulations.
	Within hurricanes, recent work has
              shown that there are smaller-scale, seemingly unrelated, phenomena associated
              with potential vorticity mixing such as mesovortices and polygonal eyewalls
              which have some common characteristics.  Dr. Schubert will employ a hierarchy
              of theoretical and numerical models, from a nondivergent barotropic model to
              one that employs the nonhydrostatic, "full-physics" equations to explore them. 
              The exciting new aspect of this study will be the incorporation of moist
              processes in the models.
	A second area of investigation is to use a version
              of the full physics model to explore aspects of the Hadley circulation and the
              ITCZ.  Of particular interest is the study of the role of cloud ice processes
              in the circulations and the sensitivity to the nature of the cloud microphysics
              parameterizations employed in the models.
	This research, while highly
              theoretical and conducted with idealized models, is critical to advance the
              understanding of the basic dynamics of tropical circulations.
