Abstract AEOS

The albedos and sizes of Near Earth
              Asteroids (NEA) are measured to understand their size distribution, composition
              and to provide indications of their origins.

Determination of sizes is the
              primary goal.  Secondary goals include determination of thermal phase
              coefficients, an assessment of the diversity of NEO surface types, and address
              the uestion of the ratio of asteroidal and cometary sources of NEO's.  The
              Advanced Electro-Optical System (AEOS) of the Air Force with the adaptive
              optics system provides state-of-the-art adaptive optics tools for these
              measurements.

This effort has participation by graduate students and an
              excellent program for student education.
