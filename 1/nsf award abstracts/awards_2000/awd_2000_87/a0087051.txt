"Bacterial community composition and dissolved
              organic matter in streams: a cross site comparison"

Information about
              bacterial community taxonomic composition and population ecology is generally
              lacking.  This study will identify and compare bacterial community composition
              among streams with different amounts and sources of dissolved organic matter
              (DOM).  The PI hypothesizes that streams that differ in the source of DOM will
              have different bacterial community composition and that experimental exposure
              of bacteria from different streams to different types of DOM can profoundly
              affect the bacterial community of streams and that bacteria differ in their
              responses to different DOM mixtures.  The project has two components: a field
              survey and lab experiments.  Field work will be used to demonstrate the breadth
              of bacterial diversity and the differences among streams. Experiments will be
              used to demonstrate of DOM differences caused the patterns observed in the
              streams.  The field survey will be done in 11 streams: six at LTER sites
              (Konza, Kellog, Coweeta, and North Temperate Lakes) and the others selected
              based on their DOM features.  This study will allow the addition of bacterial
              diversity information to the LTER information base and answer basic questions
              about factors that control microbial diversity.  Methodological limitations
              that have forced ecologists, in many situations, to "black box" bacterial
              communities will be overcome by this are and related work.  This lays the
              groundwork for other fundamental questions about the role diversity plays in
              ecosystem function and the degree to which it is imperiled by human
              activities.
