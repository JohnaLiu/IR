Abstract    :
              
This project provides for showcases and other related events to promote the
              NSF CCLI program and projects at targeted computer science and engineering
              education meetings. The project provides opportunities for presentation and
              participation at the Frontiers in Education Conferences 2000 and 2001 and the
              ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) Symposia in
              2000 and 2001 by recipients of CCLI awards. The project builds on pilot
              activities at both meetings in previous years. This is done to encourage others
              to adopt and adapt exemplary computer science and engineering models and
              materials developed through NSF CCLI support. It also promotes awareness of the
              NSF and CCLI program among conference attendees. It includes mechanisms to
              assess the impact of the showcase efforts on the attendees and to increase the
              number of quality CCLI proposals as well as to increase the number of proposals
              from new investigators.
