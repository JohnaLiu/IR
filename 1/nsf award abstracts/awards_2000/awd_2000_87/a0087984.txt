Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59) 

This project is developing a robotic assembly
              cell, the main components of which will be a six-axis Kuka KR6 robotic
              manipulator and a PowerCube Programmable Motion System. The robotic assembly
              cell will be used for three types of projects. The first is focusing on the
              programming and application of the Kuka manipulator as well as kinematic
              modeling and control of the PowerCube system. These activities are being
              incorporated into robotics as well as introductory engineering courses. The
              second type of project is focusing on automated assembly and robotic
              applications for use in manufacturing and senior design courses. The third type
              are interactive robotic and manufacturing application projects being jointly
              conducted by university engineering/computer science students and high school
              students in Oakland University's existing Remote Design/Manufacturing Program.
              The Remote Design/Manufacturing Program currently involves Oakland University's
              School of Engineering and Computer Science and three southeastern Michigan K-12
              school districts.
