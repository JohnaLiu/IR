Abstract    :
              The Science Museum of Minnesota will develop, test and disseminate "Handling
              Calculus:  Math in Motion."  At the heart of "Handling Calculus" is a set of
              model exhibits and accompanying programs designed to introduce museum visitors
              to calculus through interactive physical models that illustrate mathematical
              concepts both kinesthetically and conceptually.

The project focuses on three
              central concepts:  (1) how graphs show changes in rates; (2) how summing
              quantities over time (integration) can provide important information about
              results of a process; and (3) how the use of parametric functions can provide a
              simple way to describe a complex motion.
