The objectives of this project are (1) to identify
              elements whose concentrations are conserved once incorporated into an
              olivine-hosted melt inclusion, and (2) to quantify the amount of
              post-entrapment crystallization that is typically "erased" by diffusive
              reequilibration of Fe and Mg in the host olivine.  These goals will be achieved
              by (1) determining experimentally the diffusivities of select minor elements
              (Ca, Al, Ti) in magnesian olivine, (2) determining experimentally
              the
mineral-melt partitioning systematics of elements present in olivine as
              minor constituents for which there is currently very little data (Al, Ti), and
              (3) combining the experimental results with a secondary ion mass spectrometry
              study of the olivine adjacent to melt inclusions to identify
and characterize
              concentration gradients in slow diffusing minor or trace elements that result
              from post-entrapment crystallization. The data collected over the course of
              this experimental and analytical study will provide a better understanding of
              the effects of post-entrapment crystallization and diffusive reequilibration on
              the major element compositions of olivine-hosted melt inclusions, increasing
              their value as sources of geochemical information about the processes of melt
              generation and extraction in the upper mantle of the Earth.
