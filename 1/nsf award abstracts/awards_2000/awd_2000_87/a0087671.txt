Integrated study of hot spring and stream chemistry in major
              tributaries of the Narayani river system of central Nepal, and stable isotope
              and fluid inclusion studies of associated hydrothermal vein material is
              underway.  Data on the sources of solutes and sediments in Himalayan rivers
              indicate that active geothermal systems near the Main Central Thrust and in the
              Thakola graben are important sources of heat and solutes (including Na, K, Ca,
              Cl, Ge, Si and Sr), and release CO2 from metamorphic decarbonation reactions at
              depth  13C values from hot spring fluids are as high as +130/00, indicating a
              metamorphic source of CO2.  About 25% of the flux of dissolved K and Sr, 12-15%
              of dissolved Si, and 90% of Cl at the confluence with the Trisuli river are
              derived from hydrothermal sources near the MCT.  The heat loss from the surface
              springs is near 80 m W/m2 averaged over the area of the High Himalayan
              Crystalline series in the Marsyandi basin.
This data indicate that geothermal
              activity along the MCT has a significant impact on geochemical and heat fluxes
              in the Himalaya.
Data from hot springs and tributaries in the major tributary
              drainage of the Narayani (Kali Gandaki, Seti, Marsyandi, Bhuri, and Trisuli
              rivers) are being used to construct a chemical and water flux mass balance for
              the hydrothermal systems.  Chemical mass balance of conservative tracers
              including SO4 /=Cl- and Ge/Se will be used to estimate hydrothernal
              contributions to river fluxes.   Fluid inclusion and stable isotope analysis of
              undeformed "contribution to river Fluxes.  Fluid inclusion and stable isotope
              analysis of undeformed "post-metamorphic" quartz and calcite veins will be used
              to estimate reservoir conditions, water-rock ratios, and local geothermal
              gradients in the convective system.  
The study is providing important
              data-driven estimate of geothermal heat flow and carbon degassing from the
              Himalaya that will help resolve difficulties with current Himalayan river
              budgets for radiogenic Sr and other dissolved species and new understanding to
              both our knowledge of Himalayan tectonic processes and how they impact
              geochemical fluxes.
