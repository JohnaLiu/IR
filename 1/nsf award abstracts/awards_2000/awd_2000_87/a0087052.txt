Abstract    :
              A modern XRD instrument that is user-friendly, resilient, allows sophomore
              students to engage actively in elementary research projects in mineralogy and
              petrology and is enabling the Department of Geological Sciences at San Diego
              State University to revise its sophomore-level curriculum to include more
              opportunities for hands-on, inquiry based, activities. Research experiences are
              being introduced at this level, and students are being taught how to formulate
              testable hypotheses, construct relevant experiments, analyze results, and
              present conclusions through written and/or oral reports. In addition, the XRD
              is enhancing the department's existing program of outreach to public school
              teachers and students. This project is an adaptation of Professor Wendy
              Bohrson's NSF funded program at Central Washington University.
