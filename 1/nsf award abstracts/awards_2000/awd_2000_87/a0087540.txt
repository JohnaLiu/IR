The investigators plan to conduct a suite of
              experiments oriented toward constraining the behavior of volatile elements
              (especially hydrogen and carbon) within planet Earth. They will assess the
              elastic and structural behavior of ternary iron-carbon and iron-hydrogen
              bearing systems at high pressures and temperatures, with the goal of
              determining whether such compositions could be abundant within Earth's core.
              With respect to Earth's mantle, they will examine the phase behavior and
              elasticity of likely Archean volcanic rock compositions, in order to constrain
              the behavior of subducted material through Earth history. The goal with these
              studies is to understand whether the processes driving subduction early in
              Earth history are similar to those that operate today. Finally, the
              investigators will probe the properties of subduction-related hydrous and
              carbonated phases at high pressures, focusing on minerals that are either known
              to be stable in basalt- or oceanic sediment-derived assemblages at high
              pressure, or those that have actually been observed to occur in mantle-derived
              xenoliths. The approach is designed to provide an integrative data set to
              constrain how elements abundant in Earth's atmosphere and hydrosphere are
              cycled into, retained within, and degassed from Earth's deep interior.
