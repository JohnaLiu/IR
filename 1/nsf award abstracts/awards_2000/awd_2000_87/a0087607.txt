Water has a profound effect on the deformation of rocks through
              a number of mechanical and chemical processes.  Between 1500C and 3000C there
              is a transition regime where both processes are thought to operate is complex
              and as yet poorly understood ways that are affected by water.  This project
              will attempt to identify and quantify the roles of water in facilitating the
              interplay of solution - related, fracture - related, and dislocation related
              processes during low temperature deformation of quartz - rich rocks.  The
              approach will include use of techniques to better understand the presence and
              form of water in natural samples that come from a variety of structural and
              stratigraphic settings.  Results are expected to provide a more accurate model
              of the role of water during deformation under subgreenschist conditions, and
              will be applicable to deformation processes in the upper crust.
