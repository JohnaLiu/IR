Abstract    :
              The investigators will develop a full, three-dimensional hybrid code to simulate
              the dynamics of the coupled magnetosheath-magnetosphere-ionosphere system.  The
              objective is to fill in the gaps in our understanding of space weather
              phenomena and provide a foundation for a new generation of space weather
              forecasting systems.  The project is an outgrowth of a successful application
              of a two-dimensional global-scale hybrid code to model the magnetosphere in the
              midnight meridian plane.  The code will make it possible to model the response
              of the magnetosphere to variations in the solar wind flux and imbedded
              interplanetary magnetic field.  Extensions of the model will allow predictions
              of magnetic induction effects, which are of importance to the electric power
              industry.  The code will be developed for a massively parallel computer at the
              Arctic Region Supercomputer Center.  The techniques developed will have
              important spin-offs for simulation of plasmas in laboratory devices and design
              of microwave devices.
