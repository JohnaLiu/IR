This award supports a project to develop the techniques
              for separating net accumulation into precipitation and sublimation in polar
              firn.  The project will use existing models for firn ventilation and models for
              the transfer of chemical species to firn to create an integrated model of vapor
              and chemical species transport in firn for suites of species that respond
              differently to water mass loss.  This forward model will predict the dependence
              of geochemistry on water vapor loss.  The knowledge gained from these forward
              models will then be used to solve an inverse problem to predict the amount of
              water vapor sublimation and redeposition based on profiles of geochemistry in
              firn.  This project is a necessary first step toward inferring precipitation
              and evaporation in ancient environments, such as are recorded in ice cores. 
              This project will serve as the basis for a Ph.D. dissertation for a student
              under the direction of the P.I.   Determining how to best extract climate
              information from firn and  ultimately ice cores is the major goal of this
              project.
