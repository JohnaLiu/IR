This award
              supports U.S. participants (invited speakers, postdoctoral researchers, and
              graduate students) in the Conference in Continuum Mechanics and Conservation
              Laws on  April 27-29, 2001.  A major goal of the conference is to bring
              together leading international researchers in the fields of conservation laws
              and continuum mechanics for discussion of recent advances at the boundaries of
              the fields.

Continuum mechanics is a scientific area with well-developed
              mathematical theory and important applications to engineering.  The theory of
              hyperbolic conservation laws has been developed in conjunction with
              applications to gas dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and nonlinear elasticity. 
              In recent years there has been rapid progress in areas with connections to both
              subjects, such as the kinetic theory of gases, plasma physics, the mathematical
              theory of semiconductors, and general relativity.  This conference is a timely
              opportunity for workers in these fields to discuss important recent
              results.
