Magma chambers are an essential component in the construction
              of oceanic and continental lithosphere, and profoundly influence the thermal
              and mechanical behavior of the crust and mantle.  The mechanical properties of
              a magma chamber change during cooling and crystallization, as accommodation of
              deformation changes from magmatic flow to solid-state processes.  Thus, to
              understand the thermo-mechanical evolution of magma chambers, it is crucial to
              understand the relative importance of magmatic and solid-state flow, and the
              nature of the transition between them.  This project is investigating such a
              transition preserved in the San Jose pluton, Baja California, Mexico.  The
              pluton postdates the regional deformation, and so the transition from magmatic
              to solid-state flow reflects internal magma-chamber dynamics.  Such transitions
              are rarely observed in post-tectonic plutons, and our results will benefit
              others who are working in more complex syntectonic examples.  Detailed mapping
              and collection of spatially oriented samples is taking place along four
              transects in the pluton.  X-ray compositional mapping, microstructural analysis
              and electron backscatter diffraction studies are being employed to track the
              chemical evolution of the deforming and crystallizing pluton, and to evaluate
              deformation mechanisms and the origins of the magmatic foliations.  The project
              is supporting a PhD student, and several senior undergraduates at the
              University of Maine will participate as part of their Capstone Experience.
