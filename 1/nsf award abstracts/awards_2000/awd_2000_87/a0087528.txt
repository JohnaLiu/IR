This award to Sea Education Association, Inc., of Falmouth,
              Massachusetts, will provide instrumentation for oceanographic education and
              research for use on a new sailing vessel presently under construction. SEA,
              Inc. teaches hands-on programs in ocean sciences to undergraduate students,
              high school students, and teachers in various programs, as well as orientation
              programs for graduate students at the nearby Woods Hole Oceanographic
              Institution.  The instrumentation provided here is jointly supported by the
              Division of Ocean Sciences and the Division of Undergraduate Education, and is
              an excellent example of efforts to integrate research and education in
              environmental sciences.  Specific instrumentation to be acquired for shipboard
              use includes an acoustic doppler current profiler, a remotely operated vehicle,
              an auxiliary winch for deploying oceanographic instrumentation, CTD
              instrumentation for both vertical deployment on station and towing, a
              continuous-flow surface water analysis system, an on-board computer network, a
              suite of biological sampling nets and a variety of laboratory instruments and
              microscope systems, as well as other instrumentation.  SEA is providing
              substantial instrumentation with non-federal funds as well, as well as paying
              the costs to build the vessel.  Assistance with instrument maintenance is
              provided by the technical staff at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. 
              The instrumentation supported here will assist students in education and
              research during 2001 and future years.
