Digital
              Government: SGER: Exploratory Research for Correlating and Data Mining Flight
              Data From NSTB Accident Investigations

This grant will support preliminary
              explorations of the design of intelligent wireless flight data recorders and
              real-time monitoring systems using modern computer and information science
              concepts and technologies.  The partnership is with the National Transportation
              and Safety Board (NSTB).  Previously collected flight data held by NSTB will be
              standardized for purposes of data mining.  Potential uses of such a system
              would be to predict and provide early warning of potentially unsafe conditions
              for pilots.
