Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the University of California at Los Angeles, Dr.
              James C. Liao, Principal Investigator, for a three year Combined
              Research-Curriculum Development award entitled, "A Laboratory Curriculum for
              Gene Chip Technology."  A novel laboratory course for gene chip technology will
              be developed.  The purpose of this course is to educate students in this
              cutting-edge area of biotechnology.  Gene chip technology combines
              microfabrication processes with biomolecular recognition, and has begun to
              revolutionize research and application of life sciences and the biomedical
              industry.  This emerging field draws on engineering talents as well as
              biological knowledge.  Engineers have an unprecedented, significant role to
              play in life science research and related industry.  The objective of this
              course is to impart the basic principles of gene chip fabrication and the
              processing of gene chip data.  Students will apply the technology to
              investigate the gene expression profiles of E coli, a microorganism of
              importance to both biotechnology and biomedicine.  Results will be published as
              a database via the Internet.  Multi-media and web-based instruction will be
              used in the course.  Expertise in instructional development will be used for
              course development and evaluation.
