Abstract

The objective of this proposal is to investigate
              computationally a biologically plausible model for learning invariance. 
              Invariant recognition is a fundamental capacity of perceptual systems, which
              makes it possible to recognize visual objects under different viewing
              conditions, such as changes in the relative position of the object in the
              visual field, changes in distance, viewing direction, illumination, and also
              under shape deformations.  The purpose of this study is to extend and
              generalize the shift invariance algorithm and incorporate a broader class of
              invariances, such as size and rotation in depth and combine it with a learning
              algorithm to achieve solutions to novel types of computational problems in
              biological vision.

A major focus of this research will by on computational
              studies of biological visual problems for which there is ample
              neurophysiological and psychophysical data.  Two important and novel
              characteristics of the models to be developed are: 1) invariance is achieved
              gradually in a series of processing stages, and 2) a simple unsupervised
              learning mechanism is sufficient for connecting units in a neural network in a
              way that results in invariant recognition.  This approach is broader than
              previous approaches and therefore riskier.  However, if it is shown to be
              correct, then it will offer a uniform account of multiple aspects of invariant
              perception and allow the development of powerful learnable mechanisms for
              computer vision systems.
