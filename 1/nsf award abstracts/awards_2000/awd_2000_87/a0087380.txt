This award provides three years of support to use a broad,
              adaptable, multi-parameter approach, using a range of techniques including
              artificial neural networks to seek the relations between meteorological
              conditions and the snow pit and ice core records they produce. 
              Multi-parameter, high resolution, ice core data already in hand or now being
              collected reflect snow accumulation, atmospheric chemistry, isotopic
              fractionation, and other processes, often with subannual resolution.  The West
              Antarctic sites from which such data are available will be used as starting
              points for back-trajectory analyses in reanalysis data products to determine
              the meteorological conditions feeding the data stream.  The artificial neural
              nets will then be used to look for optimal relations between these
              meteorological conditions and their products.  Previous work has demonstrated
              the value of reanalysis products in determining snow accumulation, of back
              trajectory analyses in understanding glaciochemistry, and of artificial neural
              nets in linking meteorological  conditions and their products.  Preliminary
              work shows that neural nets are successful in downscaling from reanalysis
              products to automatic weather station data in West Antarctica, enabling
              interpolation of site-specific data to improve understanding of recent changes
              in West Antarctic climate.
