Abstract

Uncertainties in material
              properties and structural dimensions are unavoidable at any length scale, but
              they are particularly important as devices become smaller.  This work seeks to
              identify and quantify the sources and effects of the inherent uncertainty in
              micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS).  Methods for assessing the effects of
              this uncertainty on overall system response will be developed. Quantitative
              bounds on the effect of uncertainty for any given design will be accessible
              and, once this is achieved, design variables can be chosen that minimize the
              effects of the uncertainties. Software will be developed compatible with
              existing analysis packages, including finite elements, that will allow design
              optimization for MEMS in the presence of uncertainty.
