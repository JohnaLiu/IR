Abstract    :
              The Exploratorium will develop exhibit designs that encourage visitors to become
              more cognitively engaged with exhibits -- to use exhibits as tools for
              self-directed exploration, rather than as authoritative demonstrations.  To do
              this, the staff is drawing on new work in the fields of education, visitor
              research, human factors engineering, computer interface design and interactive
              exhibit development at other museums. The Exploratorium proposes to conduct
              evaluative research and exhibit development that maximizes possibilities for
              visitor-authored questions, activity and discovery, or active, prolonged
              engagement (APE). The project team plans to create 15 new exhibits and renovate
              an additional 15 exhibits in the physical sciences. The team will strategically
              position the exhibits to support active, prolonged engagement throughout the
              collection.  Although the project focuses on physical science -- the most
              fundamental part of the Exploratorium exhibit collection -- the results will
              apply to exhibits in nearly all science disciplines.
