Abstract    :
                 The IEEE INFOCOM Conference on Computer Communications will be held
              in
Anchorage, Alaska, during April 22-26, 2001. This preeminent technical
              conference is
the primary venue for presenting new research results in the
              area of computer
communications, and is widely attended by researchers and
              practitioners in the field.
Attending conferences such as INFOCOM is of
              paramount importance for the
development of graduate students, post-doctoral
              researchers, and faculty members.
   Participants have the opportunity to
              present their work, attend panel and keynote
sessions, and interact with
              hundreds of others performing leading-edge research in the
field. This
              proposal requests funding to aid approximate twelve graduate students,
              post-docs,
and junior faculty in the United States in attending this premiere
              conference.
