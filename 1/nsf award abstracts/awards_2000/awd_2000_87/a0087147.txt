Whether seismic events in the
              Long Valley Caldera (LVC) region of eastern California are due to tectonic or
              volcanic (fluid) controlled processes has been the focus of research since a
              swarm of four M6 events in May of 1980 demonstrated non-double-couple (NDC)
              seismic moment tensors. The NDC radiation of those events was attributed to a
              number of possible mechanisms including 1) tensile failure under high fluid
              pressure, 2) complex shear failure, and 3) bias due to unmodeled near-source
              velocity heterogeneity, however the controlling mechanism has remained
              unresolved. Recently broadband recordings of LVC seismicity have displayed
              anomalous radiation that may be characterized as a combination of deviatoric
              non-double-couple and volumetric dilation (NDCI) seismic sources (Dreger et
              al., 2000), which indicates that fluids are directly involved in the source
              process of some events. Whether the NDCI radiation is due to magmatic or
              aqueous injection, due to gaseous phases and advective over-pressure, or the
              proposed mechanisms for the 1980 events is the focus of this research. To
              address these questions and to investigate how widespread the anomalous events
              are we will conduct seismic waveform studies to determine seismic moment
              tensors and source process time histories of 118 ML>3.5 LVC events.
              Additionally, we will perform 3D numerical simulations to test whether
              near-source velocity structure can bias moment tensor inversion results.
              Finally, microseismicity associated with the studied events will be relocated
              to determine event specific fault structure, geometric fault complexity and
              possible temporal migration of seismicity as evidence of fluid flow during
              cascades of multiple NDCI events. Understanding the nature of seismic radiation
              in the LVC is an important step to unraveling the tectonics and
              magmatic/hydrothermal processes in the region, and to better characterize the
              related seismic and volcanic hazard.
