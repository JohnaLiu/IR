This grant provides support to acquire alternating field,
              thermal demagnetization, and susceptibility (Spinner Kappabridge) equipment and
              magnetic shielding to establish a fully functional paleomagnetic laboratory in
              the Geography and Earth Systems Science Department of George Mason University.
              The paleomagnetic equipment will complement paleomagnetic instruments and
              equipment (spinner magnetometer, impulse magnetizer, portable drill and
              orientation equipment) already acquired by GMU. The paleomagnetic equipment
              will be utilized primarily by the principal investigator, Stephen S. Harlan and
              his students, but will also be available for use by individuals from
              universities and government agencies in the regional Virginia-Washington,
              D.C.-Maryland area. The Spinner Kappabridge, in particular, will be unique to
              this region. Current research projects by the principal investigator include
              the paleomagnetism and geochronology of Proterozoic rocks in the western U.S.
              and Canada, the timing of fold and thrust belt deformation in the Cordilleran
              orogenic belt, the nature and origin of magnetic phases in modern and ancient
              soils and their parent materials, and paleomagnetic, rock magnetic, and
              magnetic fabric studies of silicic volcanic rocks in the eastern Snake River
              Plain and Yellowstone National Park. Support for the acquisition of this
              equipment is shared by the NSF Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities
              Program (EAR/IF) and by George Mason University.
