Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21) 
 
The objective of the proposal is to enhance the
              learning process for students in Calculus I and II by adapting and implementing
              the WeBWork program developed at the University of Rochester. The
              implementation will take two tracks. First, students are assigned daily 'prep'
              problems to complete before coming to class. Hence, the students are better
              prepared to discuss the day's mathematical topic. Second, remedial problem sets
              are set up for those students who need more practice on certain topics, such as
              algebra and trigonometry. In both cases, students get immediate feedback after
              finishing the web assignments and the instructor of the course is sent a report
              on students web work. 

Outcomes for this project include increased student
              performance and better faculty assessment of student performance. Instructors
              are able to access and review student performance on web assignments and use
              this information to plan focus areas for each day's class. An additional
              outcome is to have students effectively using information technology
              immediately upon enrolling in their first college math course. Finally, the
              faculty learns how to integrate information technology into their teaching.
