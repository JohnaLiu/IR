Abstract    :
               (59 Engineering Other) 
In this project, we are developing hands-on and
              visualization tools for introductory engineering courses such as statics and
              solid mechanics and other engineering courses as a proof-of-concept. The
              project addresses the need for curriculum improvement in the areas of problem
              formulation and integration of hands-on force input with computer visualization
              tools for fundamental engineering courses. Incorporating the sense of touch
              with computer visualization tools aids students in problem formulation, problem
              solving and analysis skills. These tools connect the physical systems to
              visualization and solutions calculated from theory.

Specifically, the
              developed tools help students overcome difficulties in working with
forces,
              moments, displacements and stresses, such as: 1) determination of the reaction
              forces and moments caused by applied forces; 2) determination of the shear and
              bending moment distributions in beams; 3) visualization of the deformation of a
              structure under applied loads; 4) determination of the types of stresses
              resulting from axial, torsional and bending loads. The tools enhance critical
              thinking and problem solving skills of students by engaging them in the
              learning process through individual experimentation.
