Abstract    :
              The Fred Friendly Seminars is producing a three-part, prime-time television
              series about the ethical, legal and social implications of advances in genetic
              research and technology.   The audience for the series is the general public
              with special emphasis on the scientific and policy-making communities.  Each of
              the programs will begin with a presentation of the basic genetic science linked
              to a specific ethical and policy issue and then will engage a panel in a
              Socratic dialogue based on a hypothetical situation related to that issue.  The
              panel will represent a wide range of perspective including scientists, policy
              makers and people experiencing the dilemmas presenting in the hypothetical
              situations.

Outreach material for the project will be developed by the
              National Center for Science Literacy, Education and Technology and Exhibition
              at the American Museum of Natural History.  The center will produce a 16-page
              discussion guide designed for by a variety of informal education organizations
              that reach the general public.   This guide will be available in both print and
              on the project web site.  In addition to the guide, the web site include
              guidelines about how to use segments of the series as catalysts for discussion,
              a list of annotated resources on genetics, and a behind-the-scenes look at the
              genomic research labs of the museum.
