Abstract    :
              Physics (13) More than 23,000 students are enrolled nationwide in accredited
              architecture programs. Most of these programs require their students to take a
              course of introductory physics, for three main reasons: (1) Architects need to
              use concepts and methods of physics in their profession. (2) As a component of
              liberal arts education, physics provides a framework for understanding the
              physical world. (3) As an exact science, physics develops analytical and
              quantitative thinking skills. Most architecture programs do not offer a special
              physics-for-architects course, and their students take physics with students
              from other disciplines. The drawbacks to architecture students from this
              situation are significant: They do not learn all the basic physics concepts
              that they need professionally, while they learn in detail concepts that they do
              not need. There is not enough time to introduce concepts that are important as
              general education. The amount of time
devoted to problem solving is not
              optimized for the specific needs of architects. The objective of this project
              is to develop a text, based on which physics-for-architects courses could be
              taught. The text, written from the perspective of architects, balances the
              three required components: relevant professional knowledge, general education,
              and thinking skills. The availability of such a text encourages architecture
              programs nationwide to offer physics-for-architects courses. This advances the
              knowledge and understanding of physics and scientific thinking within the
              architecture community. During the entire developmental phases, the project is
              undergoing formative and summative evaluations, both in-house - by students
              that take the course and by the architecture and physics curriculum committees,
              and externally - in architecture programs that field-test the material.
