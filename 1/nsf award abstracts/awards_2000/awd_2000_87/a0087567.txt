Our understanding of the dynamic evolution of the
              Earth hinges critically on our knowledge of the mantle's viscosity structure.
              The post-glacial rebound process provides the most important and direct
              constraints on that structure. In the last three decades, a large number of
              studies have been devoted to constraining mantle viscosity by comparing model
              predictions and post-glacial rebound data. Almost all these studies have
              assumed that the Earth's viscoelastic structure is one-dimensional with
              dependence only on radius -- a condition that greatly simplifies the modeling
              process. However, important laterally varying viscoelastic structures exist in
              the mantle and lithosphere, including lithospheric thickness variations,
              faulted plate boundaries, continental keels, and other structures implied by a
              variety of seismic tomography models. The investigators propose to develop
              spherical finite element models to study the post-glacial rebound process for a
              mantle with realistic 3-D viscoelastic structures that include continental
              keels, and other structures implied by a variety of seismic tomography models.
              They will study the coupling between spherical harmonics with different degrees
              and orders induced by the laterally varying structure, and will examine the
              possible effects of that coupling on post-glacial rebound observations. For the
              proposed research, theywill use a finite element software CitcomS that has been
              developed to model thermal convection with variable viscosity in a spherical
              shell. They will also extend CitcomS to incorporate a viscoelastic (e.g.,
              Maxwell) rheology and a deformable grid.
