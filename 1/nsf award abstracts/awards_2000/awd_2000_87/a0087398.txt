Abstract    :
              The PI will examine extended range seasonal prediction with emphasis on seasonal
              tropical cyclone activity.  He will study four areas: extended-range
              forecasting of total incidence and US landfalling of tropical cyclones,
              extended-range forecasting of intraseasonal (month-to-month) tropical cyclone
              variability, expanded analysis of the nature and role of stratospheric
              QBO-linked modulation of tropical weather and tropical cyclone activity, and
              analysis of the role of SST anomalies in the northeast Pacific (West and South
              of Mexico and Central America) in relation to seasonal trends in Atlantic
              tropical cyclone activity. This research is important because it may lead to
              improved predictions on storms and hurricanes.  This may lead to an improvement
              in mitigating the effects of  such extreme events both in terms of human lives
              and the economy.
