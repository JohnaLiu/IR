              ABSTRACT

This award is for the partial support of the Southeastern-Atlantic
              Regional Conference on Differential Equations (SEARCDE) that has met annually
              since 1981. This year conference will cover broad range of topics in the areas
              of ordinary and partial differential equations, numerical methods, inverse
              problems. The internationally recognized mathematicians: Jerry Bona (Texas
              A&M), Eric Carlen (Georgia Tech) and James Glimm (SUNY Stony Brook) are invited
              as plenary speakers. SEARCDE are traditionally providing support to young
              investigators and women.
