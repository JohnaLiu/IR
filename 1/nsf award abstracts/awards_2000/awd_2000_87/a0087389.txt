Abstract    :
              This project is investigating the impact that experimentation with
              nanotechnology has on middle, secondary, and university students' learning of
              science and perceptions about science. The enabling tool of this project is the
              nanoManipulator (nM), a device to receive visual and haptic feedback from
              investigations of nanometer-sized objects. In a series of studies involving
              scientists and students engaged in collaborative guided inquiry experiences,
              the research team is researching the role of multiple representations (visual
              or haptic) on the learning of scientific concepts of students with varying
              cognitive, affective, motivational, and sociological characteristics. The study
              is also examining the cognitive and affective outcomes on students' perceptions
              of the nature of science and scientists. In addition, members of the project
              team are exploring the development of a low-cost alternative to the current nM
              research tool.
