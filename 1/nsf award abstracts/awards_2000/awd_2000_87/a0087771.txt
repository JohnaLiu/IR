Abstract    :
              
Together with three major corporate partners, Texas Instruments, Palm, and
              Nokia, this project is investigating the impact on everyday classroom teaching
              and learning of a network of inexpensive hand-held devices equipped with
              interactive computational media. The effects of this massive classroom
              connectivity are important to understand in order to inform iterative
              improvement of i) technologies and classroom practices that support learning
              and ii) the design of teacher development and support structures. The PI and
              colleagues are working with teachers in ordinary grade 8-12 classrooms equipped
              with school-standard graphing calculators and newer devices wirelessly
              networked to each other and to a teacher's workstation. Three areas of impact
              are under exploration: (1) Assessment: regular, principled diagnoses of
              students' responses to carefully designed probes and problems submitted to the
              teacher for analysis and action. (2) Learning: new student activity structures
              involving (a) teacher-student and student-student challenges, and (b) student
              contributions to shared and publicly displayed constructs. (3) Teaching:
              teacher classroom management support for distributing and collecting student
              work, viewing and annotating student screens, and managing the flow of
              information in the connected classroom.
