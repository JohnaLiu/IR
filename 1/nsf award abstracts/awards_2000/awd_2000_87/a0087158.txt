Title:		Creating Digital Archives of 3D Artwork


Recent improvements
              in laser rangefinder technology, together with 
algorithms for combining
              multiple range and color images, allows 
accurate digitization of the external
              shape and surface 
characteristics of many physical objects.  This capability
              makes it 
possible for the first time to digitize and archive substantial
              
bodies of three-dimensional artistic and cultural artifacts, such as
              
statues, buildings, and archeological remains.  Although the 
methodologies
              needed to create and manage digital archives of 
two-dimensional artifacts
              have matured substantially in the last ten 
years, the jump from two to three
              dimensions poses new problems. 
These are problems of both scale and
              substance, and they touch on 
every aspect of digital archiving: storage,
              indexing, searching, 
distribution, viewing, and piracy protection.  This
              pilot project, 
will focus on the following subproblems of this new
              domain:

(1) cataloguing 3D artworks using techniques from image-based
              rendering,
(2) searching catalogues (and the Internet) for 3D models or
              rendered views
(3) protecting 3D archives against piracy using robust 3D
              digital watermarking,
(4) efficient streaming of 3D models over networks of
              limited bandwidth, and
  (5) real-time display of large 3D models on low-cost
              PCs.

As test data, a 250 gigabyte archive of the sculptures of
              
Michelangelo and the fragments of the Forma Urbis Romae, a giant 
marble map
              of ancient Rome will be used.  The data for this archive 
was generated during
              a year-long digitization effort called the 
Digital Michelangelo Project.
