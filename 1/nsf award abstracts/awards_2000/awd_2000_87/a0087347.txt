An important concern in the study of a
              currently active tectonic system is the role of inherited features.  This
              project will explore the relationships between the structure and composition of
              the upper mantle and major surface tectonic features in the southwest
              Cordillera, that may be inherent from the shallow segment of the Laramide slab
              having been emplaced beneath the Mojave Desert region, thus strengthening
              against the modern plate juncture system.  To the north, the intact batholithic
              segment in the Sierra Nevada retained its high-density keel which was
              susceptible to delamination and foundering into the mantle as rifting and
              transform tectonic propagated into the region.  Results should help explain the
              dramatically different response of the Sierra Nevada and the Mojave desert to
              onset of the modern tectonic system.
