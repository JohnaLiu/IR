Abstract    :
              Engineering - Other (59) 


With the current need for medical devices that
              combine mechanical systems and materials with sophisticated electronic
              components, there is a concurrent need for engineers with a combination of
              strong traditional and specialized engineering skills. To produce such
              interdisciplinary engineers, an educational program that provides a
              comprehensive interdisciplinary engineering background combined with a
              broad-based education in biomedical engineering (BME)is necessary. This is
              being implemented via a distinctive undergraduate BME concentration within the
              framework of the established engineering program at LeTourneau University. In
              addition, every engineering student in the University gains exposure to BME
              principles and experience in a BME laboratory. The BME concentration features:
              (1) 27 semester hours of specialized BME coursework, (2) 2,000 square-feet of
              BME laboratory space with modern experimental equipment, (3) 20 semester hours
              life science coursework, and (4) optional scheduling of additional science
              coursework needed for entrance to medical school; all built upon an
              ABET-accredited engineering degree. Additional enhancements include
              collaborations with colleagues at academic and medical affiliates, who provide
              student summer internships and BME workshops.
