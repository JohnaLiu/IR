Abstract    :
              Rutgers University is developing a large-format, scientific, documentary film
              about the evolving scientific investigation of deep-sea hydrothermal vents. 
              Volcanoes of the Abyss (working title) will be produced in conjunction with
              Volcanic Ocean Films and produced/directed by Stephen Low.  It will examine the
              communities these vents support and their relationship to the surrounding
              environment.  It also will consider the implications vent discoveries have for
              our understanding of the evolution of life and our search for life elsewhere in
              the Cosmos.  Much of the filming will be done from on board the Alvin deep
              ocean research vessel.

The companion Educational Outreach Program will reach
              students in middle and secondary schools and at the college level.  Print-based
              and web-based material also will be designed for use by families.  The film and
              the outreach materials together will be the basis of a substantive educational
              effort to inform the public about the intricacies and significance of the
              fascinating, but largely unknown, ecosystem.
