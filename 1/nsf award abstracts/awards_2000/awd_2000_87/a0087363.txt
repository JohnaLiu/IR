Multiphase reactors for classic applications such as fluid
              catalytic cracking are still evolving.  Reliable multiphase reactor models that
              can be used with confidence for improving existing processes and scaleup of new
              processes can benefit greatly by applying the latest computational fluid
              dynamics (CFD) techniques.

This grant is to provide support to subsidize ten
              graduate students attending Chemical Reaction Engineering VII: Computational
              Fluid Dynamics, which will be held in Quebec City, Canada.  The purpose of this
              conference will be to take stock of the state-of-the-art and identify critical
              physics and deployment needs for the next 5-10 years.  The technical program
              will include plenaries by leaders in the fields of single-phase reacting flow
              and various multiphase flows and presentation by CFD vendors and industrial
              practitioners.
