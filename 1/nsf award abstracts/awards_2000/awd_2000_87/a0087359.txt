Abstract    :
              Funding is requested to support a student-organized symposium to be held at the
              next annual meeting (December 26-30, 2000) of the Western Society of
              Naturalists. The symposium, which is entitled "Natural History in the 21st
              Century", will explore the role of natural history in modern biology. The
              proposed speakers represent diverse fields, ranging from evolutionary biology
              and ecology to molecular biology; some work in terrestrial systems and some in
              marine systems. The common thread uniting these scientists from different
              disciplines is the important role that an understanding of the natural history
              of the systems they study has played in the discoveries they have made.
              Therefore, unlike most symposia at ecology or evolutionary biology meetings
              that focus on specific topics within a field, this symposium seeks to cut
              across diverse biological fields to discuss an issue relevant to all of them:
              the role that natural history can play in research. At a time when the
              explosion of high-tech laboratory approaches and of sophisticated statistical
              designs capture our attention, it is important to re-examine what role, if any,
              natural history should play in a variety of biological disciplines. The purpose
              of the symposium is not only to explore this important and timely topic, but
              also to provide students with the valuable experience of organizing and running
              their own symposium and participating in the governance of a scientific
              society.
