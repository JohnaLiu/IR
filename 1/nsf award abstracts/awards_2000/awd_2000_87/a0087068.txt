Abstract    :
              Mathematical Sciences (21) 

This project produces a prototype for a
              curriculum project to increase the participation and success of an
              under-represented minority population in mathematics and the sciences. It
              develops non-traditional materials and accompanying assessment materials for
              developmental courses. These materials help students relate the analytical
              methods of mathematics to the rest of their world, think mathematically in
              investigations that guide their conceptual development, and develop a social
              support network for learning. It includes development of professional
              development workshops for faculty to pilot the materials. Products include
              curriculum materials for a developmental mathematics course at the level of
              elementary algebra, supplemental materials that support the least prepared
              students in a laboratory environment to learn or strengthen underlying
              conceptual understanding, a prototype for workshops intended to prepare
              instructors to use these materials effectively, and a plan for testing the
              prototype in other settings.
