Abstract    :
              

Mathematical and computational methods will be developed to endow the
              
macromechanical continuum formulation with the fine scale physics of
              
micromechanical material models. Cases of interest are: (1) Micromechanical
              
models that are typically applied at spatial scales of the order of a
              
micron. (2) Theories which incorporate microscale kinematics, constitutive
              
laws, forces and force balance coupled with macroscopic counterparts. The
              
aim is to extend the applicability of fine scale micromechanics to
              
macroscopic problems, which could then be analyzed with enhanced physical
              
accuracy by the resulting multiscale model. The methods eliminate the need
              for 
computational grid refinement to the finest microscales, thereby ensuring
              
efficiency, while preserving a tight coupling between coarse and fine
              scales.
