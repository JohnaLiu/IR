The primary goal of this proposal is to measure the zero
              pressure compressibility of a variety of silicate liquids over a wide
              temperature range using an ultrasonic acoustic interferometer.  Our
              high-temperature capability will be used to: (1) obtain relaxed sound speeds on
              liquids that are too viscous for such measurements below 1600 degrees C (e.g.,
              dacite and rhyolite), (2) access melts with exceptionally high liquidus
              temperatures (e.g., peraluminous melts, komatiite, peridotite), and (3) improve
              constraints on the temperature dependence of melt compressibility by measuring
              relaxed sound speeds over temperature intervals that span several hundred
              degrees.  In addition, experiments are planned to examine variations in the
              compressibility of silicate melts undergoing composition-induced coordination
              change of cations (Al3+, Fe3+, Ti4+) at one bar.  These experiments will
              provide analogies for understanding the consequences of pressure-induced
              coordination change of cations on melt density.  A final application is to
              silicate melts containing volatile components (fluorine and phosphorous) and a
              variety of carbonatite liquids.  All of the proposed sound speed measurements
              at zero pressure (one bar) will provide a critical complement to in-situ
              methods that allow density and compressibility to be derived at pressure.
