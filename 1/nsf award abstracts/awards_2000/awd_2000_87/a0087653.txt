Abstract    :
              This  study will continue previous work on   the nature of two reform-based
              teacher education programs and their impact on prospective teachers.  The
              researchers will follow a number of preservice secondary mathematics teachers 
              into their second year of teaching, in order to study closely how teacher
              education impacts their learning and development as mathematics teachers.  Data
              will be gathered predominantly through semi-structured interviews,
              observations, and the collection and analysis of artifacts.  The data gathering
              process will be organized around participants' knowledge and beliefs,
              participants' teaching, university teacher education experiences, and public
              school experiences.  Products will be conference presentations, journal
              articles, and postings to a website.
