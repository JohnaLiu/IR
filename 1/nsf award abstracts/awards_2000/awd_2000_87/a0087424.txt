We will quantitatively investigate cooling and
              exhumation rates of deep crustal rocks from orogenic environments using a new
              thermochronological method. The basic scientific goal of the application is to
              asses the relative contribution of normal faulting, ductile thinning and
              erosion to rock exhumation. This understanding is a fundamental concept to add
              to our knowledge of continental tectonics. This method permits determination of
              cooling rates from the age profile or the difference between the core and bulk
              ages of a mineral by a single radiogenic decay system. We will determine the
              Sm-Nd ages of central and rim segments of garnet crystals by isotope dilution
              and thermal ionization mass spectrometry. The ages will be determined from
              small quantities of samples drilled from the cores of defined dimensions. These
              data will be combined with conventional thermobarometry based on ion  exchange
              and mineral reactions to constrain the exhumation history of the rocks above
              500 oC. Integration of the data derived from the new and conventional
              thermochronology with petrological observations would permit construction of a
              more comprehensive picture of the exhumation history of high-grade metamorphic
              rocks than has been possible so far. The suites of samples are from a
              collisional orogen, the Himalaya Mountains (Nepal), arc root assemblages from
              the Sierra Nevada (California), and a subduction complex, the Catalina Island
              (California).
