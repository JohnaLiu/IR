This award supports a three-year collaborative research
              project between Professor Clifford Kubiak of the University of California, San
              Diego and Professor Tasuku Ito of Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan.  The
              researchers will be undertaking a study of the effect of intermolecular
              electron transfer on vibrational spectra.  The researchers will continue to
              develop an understanding of electron transfers that are so fast that they
              cannot be easily explained by existing theories of electron transfer.  They
              plan to design and synthesize new ligands and complexes that will be used to
              further test the physical description of dynamic effects on infrared spectra. 
              They will also be working together to optimize simulations of the IR spectra of
              exchanging systems to obtain kinetic and thermodynamic information.  

The
              project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary
              expertise and research capabilities. The U.S. researchers have expertise in the
              area of electron transfer and spectroelectrochemistry and their Japanese
              collaborators are expert in the synthesis of ligand bridged hexaruthenium
              clusters.  The research should result in the development of new spectroscopic
              methods for the study of charge transfer the "rational synthesis" of conducting
              materials, and refinement of existing theories of electron transfer.  This
              research advances international human resources through the participation of
              graduate students.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project
              will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international
              understanding and cooperation.  The researchers plan to publish results of the
              research in scientific journals and report on the findings at scientific
              meetings.
