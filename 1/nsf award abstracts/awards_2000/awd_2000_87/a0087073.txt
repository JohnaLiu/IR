Abstract    :
              The PI has used the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate
              Model version 3, NCAR-CCM3, together with observational analyses to study
              climate processes important to atmospheric ozone and sulfate aerosols.  In
              collaboration with Dr. Isaksen of the University of Oslo he has examined the
              chemical aspects of these constituents with the ultimate goal of developing a
              global climate-chemistry model.  Under this renewal award, the PI will continue
              his effort focusing on the following:

(i)   the role of atmospheric ozone in
              affecting present climate;
(ii)  the effect of climate and climate change on
              ozone distribution;
(iii) diagnoses of the systematic biases of the general
              circulation model simulated large-scale climate relevant to atmospheric
              chemistry, as part of the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project, AMIP;
              and
(iv) projections of climate change.

The work is important as it may
              provide background information useful for developing policy on emissions
              targets.
