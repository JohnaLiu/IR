Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a three year project at  Clarkson University for
              a Combined Research-Curriculum Development program entitled, "Geotechnical Test
              Simulator," under the direction of Dr. Dayakar Penumadu.  This project is a
              collaborative effort between Clarkson University and Georgia Institute of
              Technology.  The objective of the proposal is to develop virtual laboratory
              experiments and use computer simulations (in addition to the existing limited
              laboratory exposure), to complement and extend conventional components of the
              education process.  This laboratory simulator will have an immediate nationwide
              impact on the course(s) related to geotechnical engineering which are usually
              required for all graduating Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) majors
              and can be easily extended and implemented in different related branches of
              engineering education (e.g. Geology, Structural Engineering, Hydraulics
              Engineering, Environmental Engineering etc.).
