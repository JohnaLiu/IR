Lateral variations in mantle electrical conductivity
              provide insight into mantle convection, the fate of subducting slabs, the
              distribution of mantle plumes, and the nature of the transition zone from upper
              to lower mantle. Mantle electrical conductivity traditionally has been studied
              using frequency-domain response functions derived from Fourier analysis of
              permanent geomagnetic observatory time series. This method is limited however
              by the sparse and geographically irregular observatory distribution. Magnetic
              satellites, which record continuous spatiotemporal magnetic fluctuations, offer
              an opportunity to overcome this limitation since they sample the globe
              completely. The investigators have proposed to develop a time-domain 3D
              spherical Earth induction code and use data from the MAGSAT and Oersted
              satellites to investigate 3D variations in upper mantle electrical
              conductivity.
