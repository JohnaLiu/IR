Studies of convergent margins worldwide have shown that
              deformation patterns within continental crust vary according to crustal level
              and tectonic settings.  This project is aimed at determining how strain was
              partitioned vertically from upper to lower levels of an ancient orogen where
              the relative strengths and rheology of the middle and lower crust changed
              during convergence, and will utilize a deeply eroded, early Cretaceous
              granulite belt in Fiordland, New Zealand.  Results should provide a measure of
              the characteristics and kinematics of ancient lower crustal strain fields and
              determine how they changed vertically through the crust, thereby addressing the
              extent to which the upper, middle and lower crust were coupled, and the effects
              of a changing strength profile as orogenesis proceeded.  Successful results are
              expected to be applicable to a wide range of tectonic
