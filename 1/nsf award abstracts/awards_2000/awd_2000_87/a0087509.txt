This award supports the participation of American scientists
              in a U.S.-Japan seminar on biodiversity of the Kuril Island, to be held in
              Sapporo, Japan from May 18-22, 2001.  The co-organizers are professor Theodore
              Pietsch of the University of Washington and Professor Hideki Takahashi of the
              Hokkaido University in Japan.  The islands of the Kuril Archipelago form the
              eastern boundary of the Okhotsk Sea and a bridge between Hokkaido, the
              northernmost island of Japan, and the Russian peninsula of Kamchatka.  They are
              a natural laboratory for investigations into the origin, subsequent evolution,
              and long-term maintenance of insular populations.  This seminar is based on the
              results of research in this area to date.  The project is also known as the
              "International Kuril Island project" (IKIP).  

The Seminar will consist of
              the following topics:  1) description of the project and history of the
              biological investigations;  2) geological history and environmental change on
              the Kuril Islands and present-day physical, geographic, climatic, and
              ecological conditions;  3) biodiversity of the fungi, lichens, mosses,
              liverworts and plants;  4) biodiversity of the insects and spiders;  5)
              biodiversity of the mollusks;  6) biodivedrsity of the fishes and terrestrial
              vertebrates;  7) analysis and synthesis, distributional patterns and
              biogeography, dispersal and vicariance;  8) future plans and new directions. 
              The participants will also discuss future collaborations.  Two areas of
              particular significance are  1) continued work on the biodiversity of the
              Russian Far East and  2) initiation of new investigations in archaeology,
              paleobiology and cultural anthropology of the Kuril Archipelago.  Seminar
              organizers have made a special effort to involve younger researchers as both
              participants and observers.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese
              experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work,
              and will set the stage for future collaborative projects.  Dissemination of
              information on the seminar will be available at
              (http://artedi.fish.washington.edu/ikip/home.html).
