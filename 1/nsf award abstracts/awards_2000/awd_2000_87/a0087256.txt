" The relative importance
              of organic material vs. local environmental conditions on microbial decomposer
              communities: a cross-site comparison"

This work will address the issue of
              the relative importance of plant litter vs. local environmental conditions in
              determining the community composition of decomposers.  Communities from 10
              Atlantic estuarine sites, including four LTER sites (the Virginia Coast
              Reserve, Georgia Coastal site, Plum Island Estuary, Florida Everglades) and six
              other research sites will be used.  Three types of plant litter (smooth
              cordgrass, red mangrove, and the locally dominant high marsh plant species)
              will be compared to test the effect of local environment on the decomposer
              community for that plant species.  During decomposition, samples will be
              collected at 1, 2, 6, 12, and 18 months and a combination of molecular and
              culture techniques will be done to assess microbial communities.  Cultures will
              be frozen and stored as a library that can be accessed and examined as needed
              to compare the composition of the culturable fraction of the microbial
              community with that obtained with the molecular methods.
