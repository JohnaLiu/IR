Title: Spontaneous
              Rupture Sequences on Non-Planar Elastodynamic Faults: The Interaction of
              Geometrical Heterogeneities and Stress Heterogeneities and the Observable
              Consequences

Geometrical and material heterogeneities of faults have long
              been viewed as crucial features that affect earthquake behavior. Recently the
              role of stress heterogeneities has begun to be recognized as a potentially
              central feature, particularly with the demonstration that stress
              heterogeneities alone already can produce a remarkably rich and complex set of
              earthquake-like behaviors on uniform planar faults. What is missing is an
              understanding of how the two types of heterogeneities, the static geometrical
              and material heterogeneities, and the dynamic stress heterogeneities, might
              combine and interact to produce even more realistic earthquake behavior. This
              research is developing a new approach to modeling geometrically heterogeneous
              faults. This approach can simulate the unexplored realm of sequences of
              elastodynamic events on nonplanar faults. Research focuses on applying the
              models, which involve interactions of stress and geometrical heterogeneities,
              in ways that are both significant and potentially observable.
