Records of geomagnetic intensity that span time scales
              appropriate to planetary evolution -- hundreds of millions to billions of years
              - are important sources of information about the early development of the Earth
              and of its geodynamo. The paleomagnetism of layered intrusive rocks provides
              this type of record. Preliminary data suggest that many rocks from layered
              intrusions retain primary thermoremanence carried by single-domain magnetite --
              an ideal situation for paleointensity studies. The slow cooling of large
              intrusive complexes is likely to average short-term variations in the direction
              and intensity of the geomagnetic field. Providing that care is taken to account
              for the effects of slow cooling and remanence anisotropy, layered intrusive
              rocks will likely yield high-quality determinations of paleointensity. The
              investigators propose three related sets of experiments on samples from layered
              intrusions: (1) a more complete study of paleointensity variations using their
              collection of oriented specimens from the Archean Stillwater Complex (Montana,
              USA) and drill cores from the Stillwater Mining Company; (2) paleointensity
              experiments on samples from approximately 15 other layered intrusions; and (3)
              tests to determine the spatial and temporal scales over which large,
              slowly-cooled plutons average geomagnetic field variations.
