Abstract    :
              Cornell University will develop "Citizens' Science Online."  This project will
              use the Internet to develop ways of allowing citizens, at any level of prior
              sophistication, to participate in science by gathering data that will
              contribute to an understanding of the population biology of birds and for
              managing the natural ecosystems these birds inhabit.  The program has five
              components: (1) software, user interfaces and background resources on an
              Internet-based program that is accessible to any North American participant;
              (2) nine existing citizen-science projects will be modified to make online data
              entry more accurate, to make participation more user-friendly and to facilitate
              feedback of results to the participants and public; (3) an extensive library of
              online support materials and tutorials, including photos, audioclips of
              vocalizations, maps and other information; (4) integration of all of these
              Internet-based projects and information via a comprehensive Web portal, Citizen
              Science Online; and (5) testing and modifying of the interactive database tools
              through partnerships with other organizations.
