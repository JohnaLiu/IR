This one-year award will provide support for Tanmay Vachaspati of
              Case Western Reserve University and a graduate student to attend the European
              Science Foundation meeting, "Topological Defects - Non-Equilibrium Field Theory
              in Particle Physics, Cosmology and Condensed Matter," to be held in Capri,
              Italy, September 7 - 12, 2000.   The workshop will focus on the results of the
              Europeans' collaboration and the outlook for future research in this and
              related fields.  The workshop will also highlight new theoretical and
              experimental perspectives in the understanding of the physics of defect
              formation and of phase transitions.  The purpose of US attendance is to develop
              ongoing collaboration with the European members of the ESF network on
              topological defects, and to provide contacts and opportunities
