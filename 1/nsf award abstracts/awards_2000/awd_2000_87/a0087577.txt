The investigators at University of Utah will
              conduct a thermal investigation with the U.S.G.S of the San Francisco Bay Area
              along the San Andreas, Hayward and Calaveras faults. Thermal measurements will
              be collected in boreholes currently scheduled for drilling as part of the 'Mini
              Plate Boundary Observatory' experiment for the emplacement of borehole
              strainmeters. The field component of the study consists of thermal logging and
              the collection of drill cuttings and rock samples for the determination of
              thermal physical rock properties. Thermal physical rock properties will be
              measured using modern laboratory techniques. These boreholes will be re-logged
              through time to investigate thermal transients (e.g., fluid flow, ground
              surface temperature changes, thermal events associated with faulting). The
              modeling component of this project is aimed at resolving: I ) the nature of
              heat transfer and variation of heat flow along this complex plate boundary; 2)
              the thermal conditions at both the lower and upper limits of seismicity; and 3)
              the thermal influence on deformation transients as determined from geodetic
              data and viscoelastic models of deformation. The field area is ideal for the
              proposed work because the San Francisco Bay Area has relatively high heat flow
              (~85 mW m-2) and high strain rates. These two properties maximize opportunities
              to investigate relationships between the thermal regime of the crust and
              aseismic transients.
