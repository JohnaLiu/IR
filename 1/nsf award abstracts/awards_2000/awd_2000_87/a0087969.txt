Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
              University (VPI), Arun G. Phadke, Principal Investigator, for the support of a
              three-year, Combined Research-Curriculum Development (CRCD) project entitled,
              "Expansion of a Module Based Multimedia Courseware for Curriculum Enhancement
              in Power System Education."  The objective of this collaborative project
              between VPI and Iowa State University (ISU) is to enhance the existing
              web-based, modular, multimedia courseware created for the PowerLearn project
              and improve its effectiveness as a curriculum development tool.
