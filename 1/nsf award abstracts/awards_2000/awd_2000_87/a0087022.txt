DIMACS, the Center for Discrete Mathematics and
              Theoretical Computer Science, will run three "special focus" programs, one
              beginning each year for the next three years. One of the topics, Next
              Generation Networks Technologies and Applications, explores algorithms, models,
              and the fundamental principles governing the design, deployment and use of
              next-generation networks of unprecedented scale, heterogeneity, and complexity.
              The second, Computational Information Theory and Coding, is concerned with the
              interconnections among coding theory, theoretical computer science, information
              theory, and related areas of computer science and mathematics, in order to
              address challenges presented by wireless communication, magnetic/optical
              storage, signal processing in networks, network information theory, and quantum
              information theory. The third, Computational Geometry and Applications,
              emphasizes the development of geometric algo-rithms and solutions to problems
              of discrete and combinatorial geometry, and aims to deepen connections of
              computational geometry to such areas as real algebraic geometry as well as to
              applied problems from geographical information systems, VLSI design, graphics,
              and computer-aided design. The special foci are organized around a series of
              workshops. Visitors and graduate students will be heavily involved and there
              will be programs of a tutorial and educational nature.
