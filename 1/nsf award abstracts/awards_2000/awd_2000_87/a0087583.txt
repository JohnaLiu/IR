Abstract    :
              This study investigates cognitive models of scientific inquiry skills in middle
              school science.  It creates pedagogical approaches that enable students to
              develop widely applicable cognitive skills needed for collaborative inquiry and
              reflective learning.  It would investigate a number of hypotheses concerning
              how to achieve these objectives.  The study expects to result in creating a
              learning theory that links metacognition and reflective practices to the
              development of expertise in scientific inquiry.    The central hypothesis is
              that scientific inquiry can be taught, or facilitated, through computer tools
              that support cognitive modeling and reflective practice.  The investigators
              would create a support environment that houses several software advisors that
              can give strategic advice and guide students as they conduct research projects
              in science and reflect on their processes of investigation.  Also, the
              investigators would create assessments of students' expertise and evaluate the
              use of these models increases their understanding and performance of scientific
              inquiry.
