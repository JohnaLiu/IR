Abstract    :
              Biological Sciences (61) This project is strengthening the basic science
              curriculum through use of computerized work stations in the laboratory
              component of Experimental Neurobiology. Experimental Neurobiology is structured
              around the laboratory component, and provides a heavily investigative approach.
              Students learn modern neurobiology techniques including: intracellular
              recording, extracellular recording, action potential discrimination, neuronal
              tract tracing, and neuron staining and imaging. These techniques are learned
              using model invertebrate preparations that allow novice students to
              successfully record from nervous systems and perform experiments in a
              three-hour period each week. Many laboratory sessions are adaptations of
              investigations from the NSF-funded Project Crawdad, and we are developing
              several new activities based on other invertebrates. Each student designs and
              carries out an independent four-week investigation culminating in an oral
              presentation and a web page illustrating their findings. The work stations are
              also benefiting the laboratory activities in five other physiology/cell biology
              courses. Also, this equipment is greatly expanding opportunities for
              undergraduates to gain an independent research experience in neuroscience.
              Finally, the equipment is also allowing us to integrate a neuroscience
              laboratory experience in two science education courses required for pre-service
              teachers.
