Tungsten is a metal of strategic importance. Reliable
              thermodynamic data with which to calculate the solubilities of the most
              important tungsten ores, scheelite (CaWO4) and ferberite (FeWO4), and the mass
              transfer of tungsten, in hydrothermal solutions are generally not available.
              Yet, such data are required to develop comprehensive genetic models of
              hydrothermal tungsten deposits; these models can guide exploration for new
              tungsten resources. A study is therefore proposed in which the solubilities of
              scheelite and ferberite will be measured in non-complexing solutions at
              saturated water vapor pressure as a function of temperature from 50 degrees to
              290 degrees C, pH and ionic strength. The pH will be monitored directly in-situ
              using a hydrogen electrode concentration cell (HECC) of the type developed and
              used successfully at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. From the solubilities
              measured as a function of pH and ionic strength, the solubility products for
              scheelite and ferberite, and the dissociation constants for tungstic acid
              (H2WO40), all of which are essential thermodynamic data for the calculation of
              W mass transfer, can be derived. The project will involve one Ph.D. student who
              will be trained in hydrothermal geochemistry and high-pressure/high-temperature
              experimental methods. This project will not only result in the acquisition of
              high-quality thermodynamic data with which to calculate tungsten mineral
              solubilities and W mass transfer in hydrothermal solutions, but will also
              provide the PI with an HECC for future studies of other systems of geochemical
              interest.
