CRCD:  Development of a Web-based
              Integrated Learning Environment for Manufacturing Engineering Education

This
              project combines research in inquiry-based learning with emerging concepts in
              textual content identification and classification to the development of a
              multimedia learning system. The project applies a multimedia framework to the
              teaching of introductory and upper-level computer science courses for students
              with diverse learning styles, gender, and cultural backgrounds. In particular,
              the project concentrates on one introductory computer science course and two
              upper-level undergraduate/introductory graduate level courses, Object-Oriented
              Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence with Applications in Textual
              Data Mining. Applying current research in data mining algorithms and knowledge
              base creation, a reference-librarian avatar guides learners through course
              content using a multimedia interface that seamlessly connects learners,
              networks, knowledge repositories and human instructors.
