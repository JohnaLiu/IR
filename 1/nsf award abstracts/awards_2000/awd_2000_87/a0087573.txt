Abstract    :
              The aim of this proposal is to investigate new approaches to nurture and
              cultivate the mathematical imagination of all students.  Mathematics as a
              science to imagine-with is not incompatible with memorizing the multiplication
              tables, number facts, or shortcuts to operate fractions, but it changes what
              these  memories are part of.  It is about imagiining space and time:  shapes,
              patterns, or trajectories; it is about envisioning houw things could be; it is
              about discriminating the finite and infinite, the discrete from the continuous,
              and dthe possible from the impossible.  The main conjecture of this proposal is
              that cultivating mathematical imagination is deeply related to enriching bodily
              action/perception.  The research we propose intends to investigate this thesis
              through a series of studies with high school students and pre-service teachers.
