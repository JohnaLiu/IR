SGER: Measuring and interpreting nitrogen
              in tree rings  

Presently, scientists cannot unequivocally interpret
              nitrogen concentrations in tree rings.  The ability to do this would greatly
              improve understanding of N cycling, including the effects of recent large
              anthropogenic increases in N deposition.  One difficulty in interpreting N
              concentration in tree rings is that N is notoriously mobile across plant
              tissues, rendering questionable its simple interpretability in tree rings as
              indicators of environmental availability at the time of ring formation. Another
              difficulty that has confounded simple interpretations of tree-ring N
              concentration is that its response to changes in N availability and uptake is
              still uncertain. This exploratory research has two objectives: to refine
              techniques for accurately measuring N in tree rings and accounting for possible
              translocation of N across rings, and to calibrate the response of N
              concentration in tree rings to known changes in N availability.
