Abstract    :
              
The American Association of Community Colleges (AACC), in collaboration with
              the Council of Independent Colleges (CIC) and the Independent Colleges Office
              (OIC), is conducting a three-year project to develop interest in K-12
              mathematics and science teaching careers among undergraduate students and
              concurrently support K-12 faculty teaching science and mathematics. This
              project adapts components of the NSF GK-12 program for implementation in
              predominately undergraduate colleges, including community colleges. Recognizing
              the national need for excellence in science and mathematics in K-12 schools,
              AACC, CIC, and OIC and their community-based member colleges are developing
              partnerships with K-12 schools in local communities. The K-12 Teacher
              Development (KTD) program features science, mathematics, engineering, and
              technology (SMET) college students as content resources and role models in K-12
              classrooms. The college students gain mentoring and classroom experiences with
              K-12 students by sharing their knowledge and skills; the K-12 teachers gain
              content resources for their classrooms. The KTD program improves communication
              and fosters awareness of K-12 teaching as a career for college students, offers
              classroom assistance and curricular enrichment to K-12 teachers, provides
              opportunities for college faculty to help undergraduate students implement
              discipline-specific applications and pedagogical strategies, and provides
              enriched learning opportunities in SMET for K-12 students. The program includes
              the following components: 1) greater awareness by college students of K-12
              instruction in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology; 2) a network
              of K-12, community college, and four-year college faculty and schools; 3)
              collaboration by AACC and CIC to offer a national grant competition for their
              member colleges; 4) incentives such as community service scholarships,
              stipends, mini-grants, or course credit to encourage student involvement in
              K-12 schools; 5) mentoring relationships; 6) professional development
              opportunities for K-12 and college faculty; 7) dissemination through
              publications, presentations, and the World Wide Web; and 8) program evaluation
