" Dissolved organic nitrogen intersite comparison
              (DONIC)"

Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is a major component of nitrogen
              inputs and outputs in watersheds, yet it has not been quantified adequately in
              most ecosystems.  This proposal offers a synthesis of what is currently known
              about DON, and how it may be a key indicator of ecosystem processes and
              responses to increased inorganic N deposition.  The PIs plan to conduct work at
              many LTERs sites from across the globe ( Luquillo, Hubbard Brook, Bonanza
              Creek, Toolik Lake, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Santa Barbara Coastal, Sierra Nevada,
              Niwot Rigdge).  The PIs also plan to bring the PIs from multiple LTER sites
              together for discussions of methods. 

The specific objectives are to
              determine if DON inputs and outputs are a measurable and important component of
              the N-cycle from cold regions to warm regions and over a wide range of
              inorganic inputs; evaluate whether DON output makes up a substantial fraction
              of dissolved N lost from ecosystems with low N availability; test whether DON
              export is controlled by microbial activity; explore whether the N status of an
              ecosystemn can be evaluated by the ratio of DOC:DON and NO3-N: DON in annual
              export from streams; determine the bioavailability of DON using two isolation
              techniques; and discriminate terrestrial and aquatic sources of DON using
              florescence excitation matrices of humic material.
