This award supports a three year project to acquire data on
              the concentration of trifluoroacetate (TFA) in Antarctic snow. 
              Trifluoroacetate is a highly persistent, atmospheric degradation product of the
              halogenated ethane derivatives (HCFC, HFC) that have been introduced as
              environmentally friendly chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) substitutes.  However, there
              is concern that the widespread introduction of HCFC's and HFC's will lead to
              the accumulation of TFA in aquatic ecosystems.  Current data on pre-industrial,
              background concentration of TFA in meteoric and surface waters, including
              Antarctic ice, are ambiguous and the impact of anthropogenic TFA on these
              background concentrations is unclear.  Ice core records can provide proxy
              records of background and anthropogenic TFA deposition.  The primary objective
              of this research is to use ice cores and snow pits at South Pole to develop a
              temporal record of TFA deposition spanning ~ 1000 years but focused on the past
              20 years.  The pre-industrial to present record of TFA in near surface snow and
              ice at South Pole and in West Antarctica will be unique and will lead to a much
              better understanding of the origin, transport and fate of this contaminant over
              Antarctica and possibly the globe.  In addition, understanding the natural and
              anthropogenic sources, the regional and long-range movement, and the eventual
              fate of contaminants is critical to assessing potential impacts on Antarctic
              ecosystems.
