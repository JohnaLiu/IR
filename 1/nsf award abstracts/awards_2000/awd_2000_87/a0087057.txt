Abstract    :
              This project involves laboratory studies and supporting computational research
              to obtain rate constants for reactions of selected alkoxy radicals of
              importance in atmospheric chemistry.  The long-term goal for the research is to
              build a database for use in determining the atmospheric fate of alkoxy radicals
              and the degradation pathways of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the
              atmospheric.  This research will make an important contribution to our
              mechanistic understanding of tropospheric ozone production and enable better
              modeling of ozone formation in smog episodes.
