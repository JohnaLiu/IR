This award is allowing the Department of Chemistry to provide
              a state-of-the-art educational experience to our undergraduate students by
              access to a high-field FT NMR. A variety of experiments are being adapted from
              the research and educational literature and implemented into most courses in
              the chemistry curriculum. Thus, undergraduate students in many majors,
              including nonscience ones, are being impacted by the incorporation of the NMR
              into the curriculum. General Chemistry students are using the NMR in
              conjunction with IR spectroscopy and molecular modeling to study the
              implications of Lewis resonance structures to chemical bonding. The Organic
              Chemistry students are using the NMR, including two-dimensional spectra, to
              characterize products from several synthetic procedures. Students in
              Quantitative Analysis are determining the equilibrium concentrations of species
              present in polyprotic acid solutions as a function of pH. Multinuclear
              capabilities (11B and 31P) of the instrument, paramagnetic measurements,
              dipolar shifts, and line broadening are being explored in the Inorganic
              Chemistry laboratory, additional two-dimensional spectra are being investigated
              in the Instrumental Analysis laboratory, and relaxation times and isotopic
              exchange rates are being measured in the Physical Chemistry laboratory. Many
              students in the General Chemistry and Organic Chemistry laboratories are
              Biology and/or Marine Science majors so the impact of this instrument is strong
              on other science majors.
