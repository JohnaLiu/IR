This award will provide partial support for the
              travel expenses of young post doctoral researchers and graduate students who
              attend the Workshop on Non-linear Dynamics in Galaxies and Exo-Solar Planets at
              the University of Florida, Gainesville on 15-17 February, 2001. This support
              will allow students who would otherwise be unable to attend this workshop to
              participate in the scientific interchange which is important for the
              development of both their educational development and the development of this
              new and expanding field of numerical modeling.
Funding for this project was
              provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology
              (AST/EXC).
