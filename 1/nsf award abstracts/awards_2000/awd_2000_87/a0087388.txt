Abstract    :
              The PI  proposes to organize and carry out the VII International Workshop on
              Advanced Computing and Analysis Techniques in Physics Research.  The goals of
              the workshop are to discuss issues in  advanced scientific computing and foster
              closer interactions between computer scientists and physicists with the hope of
              generating initiatives that will have a significant beneficial impact on
              research.
