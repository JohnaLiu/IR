The investigators will study the effect of
              pressure and temperature-dependent density and viscosity on the development of
              convective instabilities in dense lower-crustal mafic and ultramafic cumulates
              using a two-dimensional finite element model. Previous work has shown that with
              an assumption of constant density and viscosity for the lower crust and mantle,
              Moho temperatures must be ``hot'' (e.g. >600 C at 1 GPa) in order for dense
              lower crust to become convectively unstable and sink into the mantle on short
              timescales (~10 Myr). Variable density and viscosity will allow the
              investigators to consider (1) viscous entrainment of crustal material during
              the development of an instability and (2) time-varying crustal geotherms. They
              propose that (1) could play an important role in initiating subduction at
              passive margins, where a slowly growing lower crustal root exerts a negative
              buoyancy force on the plate margin. They further propose that (2) can explain
              the topographic and magmatic evolution of the Tibetan Plateau, where an
              initially dense, stable, lower crustal root becomes convectively unstable and
              sinks into the mantle as radiogenic heating decreases the viscosity of the
              lower crust and lithosphere.
