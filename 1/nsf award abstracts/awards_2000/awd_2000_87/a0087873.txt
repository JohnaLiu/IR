Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Clarkson University, for the support of a
              three-year Combined Research-Curriculum Development (CRCD) Program, entitled,
              "Particle Transport, Deposition and Removal: Combined Research and Engineering
              Curriculum Development," Dr. Goodarz Ahmadi, Principle Investigator.  The main
              objective of this project is to develop a sequence of two combined senior/first
              year graduate level courses for providing the students with a fundmental
              understanding of particle transport, deposition and removal in laminar and
              turbulent flows, in the presence or absence of electrostatic, thermophoretic
              and capillary forces, with particular emphasis on industrial applications.
