Our research is directed toward developing
              techniques that will address the geological history of suites of rocks that
              were once deeply buried during subduction of ocean crust or during subsequent
              continental collision.  The rocks under consideration all were buried to depths
              of 40-60 km during an ancient mountain-building event, the Taconic Orogeny, in
              the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America.  This area has undergone a
              complex tectonic history, with three mountain-building events linked to
              accretion of oceanic materials or exotic terranes in the Phanerozoic:  the
              Taconic at ca. 450 Ma, the Acadian at ca. 400 Ma, and the Alleghenian beginning
              at 320 Ma.  Some tectonic slices contain materials that were also part of
              ancient North America and underwent a much older high-grade metamorphism in
              Grenville time about 1.1 Ga ago.  In any such repeatedly deformed, buried and
              faulted terrane, it is often difficult to identify with certainty the timing of
              any given event, and robust geochronogical and thermobarometric techniques are
              needed to identify the growth of minerals rather than their cooling or
              resetting during some subsequent orogeny.  Our work will apply the Lu-Hf
              isotopic dating technique on minerals with high blocking temperatures for these
              elements (garnet, clinopyroxene, rutile and zircon) that can be separated from
              high-pressure rocks (eclogites and garnet granulites) which, in some cases,
              have undergone subsequent lower grade events (amphibolite facies metamorphism).
               This effort will be combined with new thermobarometric techniques designed to
              minimize the problems encountered in high-variance assemblages found in most
              eclogites.  These approaches will be combined with mapping, structural analysis
              and U-Pb geochronology being done by our collaborators to better establish the
              timing of the early tectonic history of thrust slices in the Appalachians.
