The Mw 7.4 Kocaeli
              (Izmit) earthquake on 17 August 1999 was followed on 12 November 1999 by the Mw
              7.2 Duzce earthquake, which extended the rupture extent of the first earthquake
              eastward.  We deployed a 10 station network covering the junction between these
              two ruptures from 1 week after the first earthquake to 3 months after the
              second, and recorded ~30,000 events.  We are leading an effort to form a single
              phase-data set from all of the stations that were deployed in this study area. 
              This catalog will then be used to map seismogenic faults, monitor regional
              elastic and poroelastic effects and observe S-wave splitting in space and time.
               

Research objectives include:

1) understanding the role of secondary
              faults and of strain partitioning in the complex transtensional tectonic regime
              of the western North Anatolian transform and in the triggering of successive
              mainshocks in the sequence; 

2) testing whether the second mainshock was
              triggered directly by the first mainshock or whether it was triggered by a
              strain event closer in space and time to the site of rupture nucleation;
              and

3) investigating whether S-wave splitting can be used to monitor
              mechanical changes associated with both rupture and healing of the fault zone
              and stress changes in the surrounding medium.  This study is a collaboration
              with Kandilli Observatory of Bogazici University and Istanbul University.
