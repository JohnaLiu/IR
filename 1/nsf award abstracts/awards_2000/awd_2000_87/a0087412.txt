This project addresses the maintenance of genetically based
              variation in characteristics related to an organism's fitness.  In flowering
              plants, flower size represents an important trait of this kind.  Pollinators
              typically favor plants with large flowers. Yet in nearly all species that have
              been studied, genes for small flowers persist.  The experiments described in
              the present study will test whether small-flowered plants persist in nature
              because their flowers are more cryptic to predators.  In particular, the
              research will test whether escape from insect predation enhances the pollen
              donation success of small-flowered individuals.  Research will focus on a model
              system for studying floral evolution in the wild, the alpine wildflower
              Polemonium viscosum.      

Alpine organisms are considered early warning
              systems for biotic effects of climate change.  By monitoring the intensity of
              insect predation on flowers of a common alpine wildflower, this project
              provides data on the severity of insect damage to plants in alpine
              environments. Findings also have implications for optimizing fruit and seed
              yield in insect-pollinated crop species including strawberries, apples and
              cotton.  Breeding programs aimed at maximizing pollinator attraction in these
              crops may have inadvertent negative effects on fruit production due to
              responses of flower predators.
