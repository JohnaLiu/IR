Ecologists increasingly understand the importance of spatial
              variability in natural systems, a recognition that led to the creation of the
              LTER network. However, we still know surprisingly little about spatial
              variation in the demography of individual species, creating an important gap in
              knowledge for both applied and basic ecology. The paucity of full demographic
              studies that span multiple populations across substantial geographic scales
              creates two general problems. First, population biologists are forced to
              extrapolate from the population dynamics and life history patterns found in
              single, well-studied populations to those occurring in distant parts of a
              species range. Such extrapolation is commonplace in conservation biology,
              comparative life history analysis, and climate change predictions, and is
              currently done with little understanding of how much spatial variation actually
              exists in the demography of individual species. Second is the question of what
              sets the range limits of species. While the physiological effects of climate
              are often well-known, the lack of broad-scale demographic studies makes it less
              clear how population dynamics vary near range limits, and thus the extent to
              which poor demographic performance versus other proposed factors, such as
              metapopulation dynamics, determine the distributional limits of species. As a
              result, we have little ground for building mechanistic predictions about how
              species ranges will shift as climate changes.
