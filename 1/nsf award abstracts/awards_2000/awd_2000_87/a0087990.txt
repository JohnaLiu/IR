Abstract    :
              PROJECT SUMMARY
The rapidly changing world of information, communications, and
              computation is a stimulus for
the development of new models and new concepts
              lying at the foundation of computer and infor-
mation science and their
              development will require ever-closer connections with many methods
              of
mathematics. The PI will investigate the connections between foundational
              issues in the computer and
information sciences and different branches of
              mathematics in a series of four "working" workshops
involving both
              mathematicians and computer scientists, two per year in each of two years. The
              PIs 
will de-emphasize formal talks and emphasize discussion time and
              opportunities to explore new
potential collaborations between computer
              scientists and mathematicians. The workshops  willbe followed  followed  up 
              with opportunities for participants to meet at DIMACS to pursue the research
              direc-
tions identified. The workshops will cover the topics"Algebra and the
              Theory of Computing,"
"Computational Complexity, Entropy, and Statistical
              Physics," "Wavelet Analysis and Digital Ge-
ometry Processing," and
              "Algorithmic and Quantitative Aspects of Real Algebraic Geometry
              in
Mathematics and Computer Science."
