This project is organizing and conducting two, 2-day
              conferences on research on technology in the teaching and learning of
              mathematics.  The first conference is an in-depth examination of a series of
              papers which summarize research on the impact of technology in mathematics
              education.  The second conference is a conversation among researchers and
              authors of reform curriculum to discuss the implications of this research for
              development of more effective materials.  The papers are being disseminated
              through publication of two books as well as through presentations at
              professional conferences.
