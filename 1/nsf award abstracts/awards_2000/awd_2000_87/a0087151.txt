This award supports a two year project to analyze shallow
              (~150 m) ice cores from South Pole in order to construct an annually resolved, 
              sulfate-based volcanic record covering the last 1400 years. Two shallow ice
              cores will be recovered at the South Pole during the 00/01 field season and 
              will be used for this work. Volcanic records from polar ice cores provide
              valuable information for studies of the connection between volcanism and 
              climate. The new records are expected to be continuous and to cover at least
              the last 1400 years. The information from these records will verify the
              volcanic events found in the few existing Antarctic records and resolve
              discrepancies in the timing and magnitude of major explosive eruptions
              
determined from those earlier records.  In order to achieve the objectives of
              the proposed research, funds are provided to assist with the construction of an
              analytical laboratory for ice core and environmental 
chemistry research.
