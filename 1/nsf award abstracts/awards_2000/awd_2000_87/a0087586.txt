Vesuvius is perhaps the most dangerous of the world's
              Decade Volcanoes. 600 000 people live within 10 km of the crater and it has
              experienced 9 large (VEI >3) and numerous minor eruptions in historical times.
              This important volcano has been the subject of extensive earlier field and
              petrological studies by many groups, which supply an underpinning framework for
              this program.  The sustained explosive eruptions, which characterize Vesuvius's
              history, are highly destructive events in which stable eruption plumes may give
              way gradually or abruptly to column collapse and/or phreatomagmatism. The study
              focuses on the cause of the abrupt transition from stable Plinian eruption to
              phreatomagmatic explosions generating highly destructive pyroclastic density
              currents during the 79 AD eruption. The AD 79 eruption, which destroyed Pompeii
              and Herculaneum (Lirer et al 1973, Sigurdsson et al. 1982, 1985, Cioni et al.
              1992), is generally regarded as the 'type' example of Plinian volcanism. The
              program links macroscopic parameters describing the changes in eruption
              intensity and style with microscopic observations of pumice texture and
              chemistry. The study will (i) characterize the mixture of volcanic rock
              fragments (pyroclasts) emerging from single eruptive vents at a single moment
              and (ii) contrast patterns of vesiculation and microlite-crystallization for
              wide spectra of magma composition, and eruptive style and intensity. Large and
              small crystals (phenocrysts and microlites respectively) and gas bubbles
              (vesicles) in pyroclasts 'freeze in' aspects of the history of the parent batch
              of magma in the chamber and conduit, and represent 'microscopic windows' into
              the subsurface evolution of the volcano. We will interpret the changes in mean
              and extreme values of vesicularity and microlite-crystallinity before and after
              the key change in eruptive style. By using such well-constrained historical
              eruptions, we expect that the results of this work will have broad application
              to less well-documented historic or prehistoric eruptions and will greatly
              improve our understanding of abrupt changes in eruptive style/intensity during
              explosive volcanism, and aid in forecasting not when Vesuvius (and other cone
              volcanoes) will next erupt but how it will erupt, a question that is equally
              important from a perspective of hazard management and mitigation.
