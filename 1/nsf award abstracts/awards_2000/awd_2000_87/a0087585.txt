CISE Next Generation
              Program: Workshop on Active Middleware Services

This workshop will provide
              an outstanding opportunity to explore new, Internet-oriented software
              technologies that will open new research and application opportunities not only
              for the multimedia and commercial world, but also for the scientific and
              high-performance computing community.

We will invite researcher in active
              networks, Middleware, mobile and intelligent agents, distributed computing, and
              intelligent applications to investigate the research issues and opportunities
              enabled by the development of active Middleware services.   The workshop will
              help in defining the important research issues and challenges that must be
              solved before we can realize an open framework to the development and the
              implementation of active Middleware services and the workshop will enable the
              research community to brainstorm on these issues and define the framework that
              must be followed to address the research challenges facing the develop0ment of
              active Middleware services.

Contributions will be solicited from well-known
              researchers in areas related to active middleware services to be presented at
              the AMS workshop.
