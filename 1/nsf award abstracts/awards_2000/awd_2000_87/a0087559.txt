Collaborative Research: Integrated Analysis of the Neoproterozoic
              Vindhychal Basin, India

The latest Mesoproterozoic (1300-1000 Ma) and
              Neoproterozoic (1000-543 Ma) eras represent intervals of Earth history marked
              by profound changes in Earth system processes.  These changes include large
              shifts in atmospheric and ocean chemistry with the build-up of free oxygen; the
              transition from equable, static climate to variable climatic conditions with
              the repeated occurrence of low-latitude glaciation; and the
evolution of
              bilateral, multicellular organisms and the innovation of biomineralization. 
              Our understanding of this important interval is currently hampered by the lack
              of a well- defined and calibrated stratigraphic reference framework, in which
              data can be integrated at a global scale.  This project seeks to tackle this
              issue by means of a pilot study of portions of the Vindhyanchal basin of
              peninsular India. This basin appears to preserve a sedimentary record for much
              of the Meso-Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian interval, but has received
              comparatively little attention outside India.   Our analysis will place U-Pb
              geochronology of ash beds and other igneous units in a sequence stratigraphic
              context that will serve as the temporal and physical framework for future
              biostratigraphic, magnetostratigraphic, and chemostratigraphic studies.
