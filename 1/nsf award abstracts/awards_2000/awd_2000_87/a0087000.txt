Abstract    :
              NSF support of $5000 is requested for student participation at the 2000
              International Conference Characterization and Metrology for ULSI Technology. 
              This Conference will be held at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, June 26-29, 2000.  It
              continues a sequence of two highly successful conferences held in 1995 and
              1998, each of which led to a formidable Proceedings book published by the AIP
              Press.  The funds will support student travel and registration for about 20
              students who will be making presentations and submitting papers for the
              Conference Proceeings.  The Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) and the
              American Vacuum Society (AVS) are also contributing funds toward student
              support ($5K from SRC, $2K from AVS).
