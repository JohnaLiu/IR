This award supports the development and testing
              of digital probes
for high precision temperature measurements in boreholes in
              polar
ice sheets. These measurements are key to obtaining
              calibrated
paleotemperature records in the polar regions.
The current
              state-of-the-art system is the USGS Polar Borehole
Temperature Logging System
              (PBTS), which uses analog probe technology
with the electronic package at the
              ice sheet surface.  Strong winds can
disturb the recording electronics,
              forcing the field team to modify
logistics plans to produce high quality data.
               Probes that transmit
digital signals up the cable would not be affected by
              these surface
conditions, improving the efficiency of field operations.  This
              project
will adapt a recently-designed digital probe for use with the PBTS
              system
in cold temperatures in polar drilling fluids.  These probes will
              reduce
some of the stringent hardware and procedural requirements of the
              current
analog system.  These new digital probes will be calibrated alongside
              the
currently used sensors and will be tested at Siple Dome as part of
              an
already-funded program of borehole temperature logging.  The final
              product
(in addition to a working borehole temperature logging system with
              new
digital probes) will be a publication in the Journal of
              Glaciology
describing the new probes, the comparisons, and the new
              research
opportunities that digital probes can offer.
