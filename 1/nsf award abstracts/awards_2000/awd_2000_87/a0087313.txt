Dr. Michael Shara is conducting an all-sky survey to
              discover nearby high proper motion objects in the solar neighborhood using
              first- and second-epoch Digitized Sky Survey data.  The SUPERBLINK software
              tool is used to identify objects that have moved between the two image epochs,
              roughly spaced 40 years apart.  The main goal of the project is to complete the
              census of lower main sequence, white dwarf and subdwarf stars in the solar
              neighborhood.  A carefully selected subset of this sample will be targets for
              the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM).  The entire database generated by this
              project is incorporated into a web-accessible resource.
Funding for this
              project is provided through the joint NSF/NASA "Nearby Stars (NStars)"
              initiative and the NSF Mathematical & Physical Sciences Directorate Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities (MPS/OMA).
