Abstract    :
              The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) and the National Laboratory for
              Applied Network Research (NLANR) will host a planning workshop that will bring
              together experts in the areas of networking and wireless - including satellite
              - communications, network administrators from the Experimental Program to
              Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) campuses, and field station
              researchers, in order to exchange and discuss information on the networking
              needs in the rural areas of the country. Rural areas across the nation include
              field stations and observatories for various scientific disciplines, as
              well
as remote schools, including tribal colleges. This workshop will be the
              starting point to exchange state-of-the-art with state-of-practice information,
              and to discuss the projected network communication needs of the researchers, as
              well as to develop a consensus of probable paths to solving these needs.
