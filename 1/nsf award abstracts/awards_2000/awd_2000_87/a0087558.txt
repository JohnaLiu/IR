Abstract    :
              A permanent exhibition entitled "Search for Extraterrestrial Life" will engage
              visitors at the New York Hall of Science in applying the fundamental biology of
              life on Earth to understanding the search for life elsewhere.  The 4,000 sq.
              ft. exhibition and accompanying programs will engage visitors in learning more
              about the wide range of conditions that support life on Earth, and how these
              life requirements shape the search on Mars and other planetary objects for any
              existing life forms.  In addition, the technologies and strategies that
              scientists are developing to detect any life elsewhere will be
              highlighted.

It is expected that 500,000 visitors each year will participate
              with the exhibit and its associated programs.  Another dissemination plan for
              the project will be posting fabrication drawings and scripts in readily
              accessible formats on the Internet.  Copies of all computer interactives on
              electronic media will be available to science-technology centers, museums and
              other informal learning institutions.
