This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will examine the
              role of state agents, specifically customs officers, in the management of
              international boundaries and the implications of this process for the
              expression of state sovereignty in Ghana. Ghana has recently and successfully
              implemented market reform policies and promoted liberal foreign trade and
              investment. The research will investigate how economic liberalization is
              reflected in and has shaped state boundary control and construction. Three
              sites - the international airport, a major national border site, and a
              peripheral border site - will be compared to analyze how different types of
              global commerce, as well as variation in state surveillance, border officers'
              training, and local/regional integration, impact state border management. 
              Methods include policy analysis, extensive observation and documentation of
              day-to-day border activities, decision analysis of border agent activities,
              structured interviewing of agents, and survey data analysis. This project
              presents a number of methodological challenges due to the political sensitivity
              and secrecy surrounding border activities. The researcher has research
              affiliation and research clearance from the Institute of African Studies at the
              University of Ghana. This study will contribute to our sociopolitical
              understanding of the nation state and its efforts to maintain sovereignty in a
              highly transnational and global world.
