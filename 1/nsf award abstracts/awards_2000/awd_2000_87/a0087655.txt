Abstract    :
              Chemistry (12)

The importance of Fourier Transform-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
              (FT-NMR) spectroscopy in modern chemistry is reflected in the 1999 American
              Chemical Society Committee on Professional Training guidelines for the
              undergraduate organic chemistry curriculum which recommends hands-on training
              in 1 H and 13 C NMR for undergraduate students. In addition, more advanced
              pulse sequences such as 2-D NMR have become increasingly vital tools for the
              modern chemist. In order to incorporate these recommendations, the Department
              of Chemistry has purchased a 300 MHz instrument capable of teaching the broad
              range of experiments that comprise modern FT-NMR. We are infusing this
              technology across our undergraduate curriculum in a series of experiments,
              adapted from the current literature (research and educational), that is
              designed to progressively introduce a series of 1-D and 2-D NMR techniques. In
              doing so, we are adapting the approach recently instituted at Florida State
              University (CCLI A&I DUE-9972198), adjusting for the size of our student
              population and tuned to existing strengths in our curriculum. The instrument is
              being used first by students in their sophomore-level Organic Chemistry
              sequence to interpret and to obtain 1 H and 13 C spectra, then in a progressive
              fashion in Qualitative Organic Analysis, Physical Chemistry, Advanced Synthetic
              Methods, and Undergraduate Research in which more sophisticated techniques and
              the multi-nuclear nature of FT-NMR are explored.

Outcomes include students
              with extensive hands-on experience in a variety of NMR techniques.
              Additionally, we are studying the pedagogy of teaching NMR across the
              curriculum and are in the process of producing a web accessible database of
              spectral FID's emphasizing 2-D NMR as a problem-solving tool. The database is
              providing a unique resource to other universities that may wish to implement
              2-D NMR spectroscopy into their curriculum but that lack the instrumental
              capabilities to do so.
