              ABSTRACT

Collaborative Research: A detailed chronology of the Loess-Paleosol
              Record of the last glacial/Interglacial Cycle in the North American
              Midcontinent

Loess deposits represent one of the most important terrestrial
              records of long-term Quaternary climatic change.  High-resolution records of
              past environmental conditions can be extracted from loess deposits provided
              that the deposits can be accurately dated.  We propose to apply three
              independent dating techniques (10Be inventory, AMS14C, and Optically Stimulated
              Luminescence) to develop a high-resolution chronology for loess of the last two
              glacial/interglacial cycles in eastern Nebraska.  This chronology will enable
              us to make accurate estimates of dust flux to the atmosphere over this time
              period, to evaluate the relative contribution of competing loess sources in the
              North American Midcontinent, and to determine the length of time represented by
              the last interglacial (Sangamon) soil in eastern Nebraska.
