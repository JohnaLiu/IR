Abstract    :
              This project seeks to conduct research on the types of science assessment
              measures that provide data on student outcomes that are useful, accurate, and
              allow valid inferences.  The goal of the project is to help Systemic
              Initiatives to measure the impact of their efforts to improve student learning
              in science and to use assessment results to inform and improve instruction. 
              The questions addressed by the project are such things as:  "what types of
              measures best inform standards-base instruction? Does exposure to inquiry-based
              science instruction improve scores on some components of standards-based
              science assessment more than others? How do teachers use results from
              assessment to inform practice? Will training change instruction?"  The study
              will recruit a sample of schools in California at elementary, middle, and high
              school levels and administer a pre- and  post-test, a teacher interview and a
              student interview and survey questionnaire.  These data will be analyzed in a
              multidimensional item response model.
