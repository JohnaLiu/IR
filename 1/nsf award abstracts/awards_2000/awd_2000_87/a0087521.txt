This  award supports a two year project to develop a new
              method for measuring vertical strain rates in polar firn.  Vertical strain rate
              measurements in the firn are important because they can aid in the
              understanding of the dynamics of firn compaction, a key factor in determining
              ice age/gas age difference estimates for ice cores.  Vertical strain rate
              measurements also determine ice advection for borehole paleothermometry models,
              and most importantly can be used to date the shallow sections of ice cores
              where ambiguities in chemical dating or counting of annual layers hinder dating
              by traditional methods. In this project a video logging tool will be used to
              create a unique "optical fingerprint" of variations in the optical properties
              of the firn with depth, and track the movement and deformation of the features
              of this fingerprint.  Preliminary work at Siple Dome, Antarctica using an
              improvised logging system shows a series of optically bright and dark zones as
              the tool transits up or down the hole.  Borehole fingerprinting has the
              potential to improve measurements of vertical strain in firn holes.  This
              project represents a unique opportunity to interface with an existing field
              program where a borehole vertical strain rate project is already underway.  A
              graduate student will be supported to conduct the work on this project as part
              of a PhD. dissertation on climate and physical processes in polar firn.
