This award provides support to continue paleoclimate and ice
              dynamical studies of the Siple Dome deep ice core and associated shallow cores
              from West Antarctica, to help understand the history of climate and ice-sheet
              stability.  Visible examination of the ice cores contributes to the required
              dating of the paleoclimatic records.  Because ice-flow corrections for
              accumulation rates are difficult in deep ice, a new physically based
              paleoclimatic indicator of temperature or snow accumulation will be developed,
              based on bubble-size histories and on the physics of firn densification and
              grain growth.  The paleoclimatic reconstruction of summer temperatures will be
              accomplished through observation and analysis of the rare melt layers in the
              ice core.  Studies of the distribution of climate change in space and time will
              be continued, focusing on the possibility that a climate oscillation of ~ 1500
              years has combined with "noise" from changes in freshwater fluxes to force
              rapid, large, nearly synchronous, widespread to global changes in the mode of
              operation of the climate system.  Visual and c-axis studies of ice grains in
              the core will help detect flow disturbances, such as the ones which were seen
              in the GISP2 ice cores, if they are present in the Siple Dome core.  The
              results of this study should lead to a better understanding of rapid climate
              change in Antarctica and, through comparison, to other records worldwide.  The
              study should also contribute to knowledge of the flow and stability of the West
              Antarctic ice sheet.
