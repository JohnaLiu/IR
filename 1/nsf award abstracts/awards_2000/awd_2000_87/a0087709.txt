This award supports a project for a detailed laboratory-based
              study of glacial moraine boulders collected on the flank of Mt. Waesche, a
              nunatak in the Executive Committee Range, Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica. 
              Preliminary work on these samples resulted in measurement of past ice sheet
              elevations in interior West Antarctica.  Funds are requested here to measure
              exposure ages in the remaining samples from the moraine and adjacent volcanic
              bedrock.  The goal is to use a combination of field observations, surface
              exposure dating (Helium-3, Neon-21 and Chlorine-36) and Argon-40/Argon-39
              dating to constrain past elevations of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS). 
              The initial study demonstrated that higher past ice levels are recorded by
              moraines, composed of volcanic debris left behind by receding ice, and that
              Helium-3 and Chlorine-36 surface exposure dating can be used to constrain the
              timing of past ice high stands.  It is expected that these analyses will refine
              the initial results pertaining to the last deglaciation and provide a unique
              record of earlier ice sheet elevations.  The primary long-term objective is to
              provide chronological and elevation data of the paleoglaciology of the interior
              of the WAIS prior to 10 kA.  The unique record of surface ice elevations at Mt.
              Waesche provides key constraints on the behavior of the ice sheet and its
              response to climate and sea level change.  This information will contribute
              strongly to determining why the WAIS behaved as it did during the last
              deglaciation and the previous interglacial, and will help efforts to predict
              how it will change in the future.
