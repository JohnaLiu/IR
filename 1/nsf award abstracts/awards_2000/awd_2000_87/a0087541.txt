This work is a study of the structure of the solar
              atmosphere using observations of the velocity and intensity of optical signals
              from the solar surface.  These signals will be used to produce detailed maps of
              the speed of acoustic waves in the lower part of the solar atmosphere.  These
              maps in turn will be inverted to provide information on how the speed of sound
              changes with location and time in the solar atmosphere.

This project
              provides an important first step towards being able to map the acoustic and
              magnetic properties of the Sun's atmosphere in three dimensions.  Such data
              will be invaluable in our quest to understand how the Sun impacts terrestrial
              processes.  Three specific goals will be pursued in the course of this study:
              (1) to provide the first detailed maps of the sound speed structure in the
              Sun's lower atmosphere, (2) to examine the short-term variability of the
              observed structure, and (3) to test and refine current models of the solar
              atmosphere.

The advantages of South Pole station as an observing site
              include excellent sky transparency, low atmospheric humidity, and long periods
              of stable seeing conditions.  Further, velocity and intensity observations will
              not require correction for an unwanted signal due to the Earth's rotation.
