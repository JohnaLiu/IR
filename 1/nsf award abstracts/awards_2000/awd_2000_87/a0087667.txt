Abstract    :
              An International Symposium on Biological Polyesters will be held from September
              11-14thm, 2000, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  This conference focuses on
              developments in the study of biological polyesters, a field at the interface of
              chemical, materials and biological sciences with direct applications in
              biotechnology, medicine and basic biological research.  This rapidly expanding
              field has become the focus of great interest in both industrial and medical
              sectors, responding to the increasing need for bioinspired and environmentally
              biodegradable specialty polymers.  Discussions during the planned conference
              include sessions on recent advance in the understanding and manipulation of
              synthesis and degradation pathways in different biological systems (plants and
              microbes) and their impact on polymer design and development.  Practical
              applications of biological polyesters in fields of medicine, commodities, and
              chemicals will also be presented in dedicated sessions.  The conference will be
              attended by approximately 200 academic and industrial scientists from around
              the world.
