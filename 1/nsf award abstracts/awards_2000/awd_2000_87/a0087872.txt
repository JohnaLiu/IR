Abstract    :
              The Antarctic region is typically considered pristine, being distant and largely
              sheltered from the industrialized world.  But concern about the movement of
              persistent organic pollutants (POPs) throughout the global environment via
              long-range atmospheric transport has escalated greatly in the last two decades.
               The potential for POP contamination via atmospheric transport, cold
              condensation and deposition on sea ice present an intriguing and uniquely polar
              issue.  The overall goal of this proposed work is to understand the
              interactions among atmospheric deposition, sea ice coverage and melting, solar
              irradiance and microbial decomposition in mobilizing persistent organic
              pollutants in Antarctic foodwebs.  In cooperation with the Palmer Long-Term
              Ecological Research program (LTER), the proposed work aims to document the
              accumulation of selected model POPs in sea ice and the water column along the
              West Antarctic Peninsula.  Furthermore, key physical and biological/chemical
              processes influencing POP removal rates, turnover, and residence times would
              also be investigated.
