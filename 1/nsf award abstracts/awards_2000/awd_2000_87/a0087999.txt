This award supports a project to continue studies
              of the triple isotope composition (O-17 and O-18) of oxygen in fossil air
              trapped in ice cores.  This property is of interest because photochemical
              reactions in the stratosphere induce  isotope exchange between oxygen and
              carbon dioxide that lowers the O-17  of oxygen by the same amount as the O-18
              ("mass independent fractionation").  This isotopic tag is anomalous in the
              sense that other factors influencing the isotopic composition of oxygen change
              O-17 by 0.5 times as much as they change O-18.  Respiration consumes ambient
              (anomalous) oxygen , and photosynthesis replaces it with oxygen which is
              normally fractionated.  Therefore, the triple isotope composition of oxygen
              give a measure of the gross rate of photosynthesis on the planet.  Preliminary
              results focussing on the last 60,000 years indicate that the production of the
              global biosphere during the Last Glacial Maximum was about 90% of that today. 
              Because land production was much less than today, the O-isotope data imply that
              oceanic gross production was much greater than today.  This increase has been
              attributed to a higher glacial flux of dust (and iron) to the oceans.  This
              project will extend current measurements of the triple isotope composition of
              oxygen back to 400,000 years in order to derive the curve of the relative rate
              of photosynthetic oxygen  production vs. time.  The results, at 1 kyr
              resolution, will constrain changes in production associated with glacial
              maxima, interglacials and glacial terminations; with long interstadial events;
              and with orbital insolation cycles unaccompanied by large changes in ice
              volume.  This work will lead to a better understanding of ways in which the
              biosphere responds to and influences climate.
