The proposed work will provide and maintain of a deep sea
              sediment trap mooring in the Polar Frontal Zone south of Australia, which
              complements a similar Australian sediment trap mooring in the Subantarctic Zone
              deployed by the Australian Antarctic Cooperative Research Centre.  The
              Australian program has recently been extended; this proposal work will extend
              the joint work for two years until 2003.  The specific objective is to examine
              the production of particulate matter, remineralization, and export using a
              radionuclide technique that will allow the evaluation of sediment trap
              efficiency.  A further objective is to document whether intermediate depth
              water masses that are ventilated at high southern latitudes can provide a
              temporary reservoirfor anthropogenic carbon dioxide, and to understand the role
              of this region in the long term trends and interannual variability of
              atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.
