Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to foster and study the process by which designers,
              researchers, and practitioners work together, in the same project, but with
              different schools, geographic areas, and partnerships.  These collaborations
              among researchers will be likely to produce flexible curriculum that other
              teachers can then customize for use.  One goal is to allow the average teacher
              the ability to make these units work in her classroom; another is to understand
              the process of abstraction and accumulation of knowledge and practice across
              education research projects in general.  The project would then support the
              development of a SCALE web portal and two summit meetings of developers, plus
              work with teachers in using the materials.  Each year, the project will support
              2-3 small projects.
