The magnetic behavior of multidomain particles is
              governed by nucleation and disappearance of domain walls and by domain wall
              pinning. These processes have been studied intensively but never combined in a
              single self-consistent model. The object of this proposal is to develop a
              numerical micromagnetic model that includes magnetoelastic interactions with
              stress fields due to defects. The model will be unconstrained so that domain
              walls can nucleate or disappear spontaneously and be pinned by the stress
              fields. Results will be compared with domain observations of stressed
              magnetite, pyrrhotite and hematite. For each particle that is modeled, a
              systematic approach will be used to map out all major and minor magnetization
              curves as a function of applied field and temperature. These curves will be
              used to simulate a wide variety of isothermal and temperature dependent
              experiments.
