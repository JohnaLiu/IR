Abstract    :
              Today the World Wide Web is the foundation of e-commerce (including,
              e-advertisement, e-banking, etc.)  Unfortunately, the World Wide Web does not
              offer good support for anonymity (called "privacy" in the popular press). 
              While in a mechanical society window shoppers do not need to identify
              themselves, they implicitly or explicitly do so (to a certain extend) when
              using the World Wide Web. "Privacy" concerns may limit the growth and the use
              of the internet.

The state of the art techniques to guarantee anonymity only
              provide weak security, or are too expensive to be used, or are completely
              impractical.  Moreover, some protocols have been broken.  The goals are:

1.
              to revisit and to (crypt) analyze existing protocols,
2. to study more
              efficient protocols to achieve robust anonymous communication,
3. to develop
              protocols to guarantee anonymity even when insiders are trying to break the
              anonymity, or trying to disrupt the anonymous communication,
4. to address the
              user-friendly aspect of cookies, without endangering the anonymity of the
              communication,
5. to enhance very secure (called unconditionally secure)
              protocols for anonymous communication,
6. to study limited anonymity.
