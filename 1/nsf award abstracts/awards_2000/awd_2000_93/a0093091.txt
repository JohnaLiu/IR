Abstract    :
              Dr. Gammie will carry out a research program in theoretical and computational
              astrophysics that focuses on building numerical models of plasmas flows around
              black holes.  The release of gravitational binding energy in black hole
              accretion flows is thought to power quasars and active galactic nuclei, and, in
              our own galaxy, the black hole X-ray binaries.  Dr. Gammie will lead an effort
              to develop a new code for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, together
              with a postdoctoral researcher and students.  This code will be able to address
              some of the fundamental unsolved problems in the field, related to how jets are
              launched and under what circumstances energy may be extracted from a rotating
              black hole.  In teaching, Dr. Gammie will develop a 'digital demo room' to aid
              in astronomy and physics instruction.  The numerical models available in this
              demo room will focus on topics in stellar evolution, supernovae, star formation
              and galactic structure.  The demo room will be based around a web interface,
              which will be tuned to give students access at introductory, intermediate, or
              advanced levels.  The demo room will be developed with the participation of
              undergraduate students in astronomy, computer science, education, graphic
              design and physics.
