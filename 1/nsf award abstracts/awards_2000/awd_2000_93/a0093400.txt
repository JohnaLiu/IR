Abstract    :
              A number of new applications have recently emerged that require the
              storage,
maintenance, and analysis of massive amounts of data. Examples such
              as web
search engines, data warehouses, and large scientific data repositories
              
often involve multiple terabytes of data that are simultaneously searched and
              
explored by many users. This research project investigates fundamental
              
algorithmic problems arising in the context of such large data sets, studies
              
the complexity of these problems, develops new techniques for their efficient
              
solution, and experimentally validates proposed techniques in the appropriate
              
system and application context. The main focus is on problems arising in
              
databases and in searching and analyzing the World-Wide Web.

              precisely, the research focuses on problems concerning the storage,
              
maintenance, partitioning, indexing, and approximate representation of very
              
large data sets, and the efficient exploration, analysis and precise and
              
approximate querying of such data. The types of problems that are studied
              can
be grouped into two categories, one consisting of problems motivated
              mainly 
by applications in the database area, and one motivated by
              applications in 
web search and analysis. In the first category, the project
              studies 
multi-dimensional data partitioning problems arising in selectivity
              estimation
and indexing, feedback-based approaches to selectivity estimation,
              association
rule mining problems, and the approximate and precise evaluation
              of complex
queries on large data sets. The problems studied in the second
              category are
concerned with online search on the web, the study of random
              graph models for
the web, and efficient computing with large web graphs and
              hypertext 
collections.
