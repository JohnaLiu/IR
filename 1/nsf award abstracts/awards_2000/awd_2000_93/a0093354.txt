Abstract    :
              Energy consumption is a key constraint in the design of modern microprocessors,
              limiting battery life in portable devices and achievable performance in
              high-performance systems.  Modern instruction set architectures such as RISC or
              VLIW are based on extensive research into how instruction set design
              affects
performance, and provide a purely performance-oriented
              hardware-software interface.  Implementations of these ISAs perform many
              energy-consuming microarchitectural operations during execution of each
              user-level instruction and these dominate total power dissipation.  Because
              modern architectures pipeline and parallelize this microarchitectural work, it
              has little effect on the latency and throughput of user instructions, thus
              there is no incentive to expose the micro-operations in a purely
              performance-oriented
hardware-software interface: energy consumption is hidden
              from software.  The project will develop new energy-exposed microprocessor
              architectures that give software much greater control over
              the
microarchitectural components used to execute each operation.  The
              research will develop new integrated hardware and software energy-saving
              techniques by simultaneously considering all levels of processor design,
              including VLSI circuits, microarchitectures, instruction sets, compilers, and
              operating systems.  The project will also be used to bring energy-efficiency
              into the curriculum of existing undergraduate and graduate computer
              architecture courses.
