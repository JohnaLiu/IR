Abstract    :
              This CAREER proposal seeks to establish a fundamental understanding of the
              molecular level mechanisms and dynamics of cholesterol crystal nucleation and
              growth using in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). The chemical functionality
              and microstructure of cholesterol monohydrate crystal faces will be established
              using chemical force microscopy and phase imaging techniques.  In situ AFM
              growth experiments will afford direct information on crystal growth mechanisms
              (kinetics and anisotropy) and the characterization of molecular level defects
              under a variety of solution and well-established model bile conditions. 
              Crystal nucleation and growth will additionally be investigated in the presence
              of epitaxial mineral substrates and rationally designed inhibitors. 
              Educational aspects of this plan include the development of a new undergraduate
              organic laboratory experiment concerning crystal growth from gel media, and the
              establishment of the first annual East Coast Graduate Student Organic Materials
              Symposium.
