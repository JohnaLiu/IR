The PI proposes to
              study experimentally the flow of complex fluids at the microscale.  The
              specific problems are the steady and pulsatile converging flows containing
              solid or      deformable particulate suspensions. These flows are important in
              biological fluid mechanics and in applications of micro-fabrication.  The PI is
              well qualified for this work and has most of the required equipment in his
              laboratory.  The issues that are to be addressed by the proposed research can
              serve as the foundation for the PI's professional development.  In addition,
              The PI has proposed an excellent educational plan including an introductory
              engineering course with weekly lectures and experiments taught by faculty and
              graduate students of various discipline and people from industry, the use of
              internet-based remote-control fluid mechanics laboratories, and high school
              outreach programs.
