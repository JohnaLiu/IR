Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop database technologies that address the
              demands of data-intensive applications, which handle distributed, spatial and
              multimedia data sources. The research effort focuses on: (1) the development of
              new spatial query processing algorithms that can be dynamically and flexibly
              reordered and adapted during query execution to address the fluctuation in
              response time and the unexpected delays from the various input web-based
              spatial data sources; (2) the development of indexing techniques and
              technologies to facilitate the embedding of non-traditional spatial and
              high-dimensional indexing structures into database systems; and (3) the
              development of disk scheduling algorithms that scale up towards achieving
              multiple quality of service requirements for multimedia applications. The
              techniques generated by these research tasks will facilitate the efficient
              support of modern applications in database systems and will allow database
              systems to match the dynamically changing demands of these applications. The
              education effort focuses on: (1) the involvement of both undergraduate and
              graduate students in hands-on research activities and experimentation; (2) the
              development of several curriculum elements including two courses and three
              educational tools, and the introduction of these tools into the existing and
              newly developed courses; (3) the development of a multimedia database and
              information systems laboratory to facilitate the integration of research
              results and education; and (4) facilitating industrial interaction for
              students. The outcomes of this project -- including newly developed database
              technologies, research tools, and curriculum elements -- will be publicly
              disseminated and shared with colleagues, students, and industrial collaborators
              in the database systems area.
