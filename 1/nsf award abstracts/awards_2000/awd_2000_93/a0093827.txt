Abstract    :
              In recent years, countries on every continent have embraced biotechnology and
              incorporated it into national priorities, policies and planning.  The goal of
              this Career Development project is to develop integrated models of research,
              teaching and pre-college outreach initiatives addressing issues of ethics,
              values and equity relating to biotechnology in a worldwide context.
              Specifically, the research component of this project will identify and compare
              key ethics, values and equity issues relating to biotechnology in a number of
              developed and developing countries (India, South Africa, Switzerland and the
              United States) using a combination of quantitative and qualitative
              methodologies to identify the ethics, values and equity issues influencing the
              promotion of or resistance to biotechnology around the world.  The education
              component of this project involves high school teachers in a cross-cultural
              science education exchange, both to participate in data collection and to share
              strategies relating to biotechnology education.  Findings from the research
              will be presented at national and international meetings and submitted to
              journals in a variety of science and social science fields.  Informed by
              results from the cross-cultural research, curricula at the graduate and
              undergraduate and pre-college levels will be developed.  Findings will also be
              made available to representatives in the host countries, and cooperative
              arrangements for curricular exchanges developed.  A website about the project
              and its results will be maintained at Portland State University.
