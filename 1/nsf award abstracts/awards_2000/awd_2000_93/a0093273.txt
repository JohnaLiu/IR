Abstract    :
              This research is on an interconnect-centric layout design methodology
              incorporating on-chip inductance into the methodology. Specifically, the
              following problems are explored: (1) accurate modeling and analysis techniques
              for multiple coupled RLC interconnects; (2) efficient algorithms for
              interconnect synthesis to optimize performance and signal integrity for coupled
              RLC nets; (3) efficient algorithms for pre-layout interconnect estimation
              considering a comprehensive set of interconnect optimization techniques, and
              application of estimation results to interconnect architecture planning; and
              (4) efficient algorithms for pre-layout  estimation of maximum switching
              current for functional blocks followed  by optimization of the power supply
              structure using the RLC model. In addition, this project investigates an
              innovative computer engineering curriculum incorporating interconnect and
              System-On-Chip (SOC) considerations, and development of Web-based interconnect
              planning tools for use in innovative teaching and for outreach beyond the
              campus.
