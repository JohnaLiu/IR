Abstract    :
              The PI proposes experiments to identify ATPS polymers and operating conditions
              so that tagged DNA will strongly partition to one phase, leaving polar proteins
              and untagged DNA in the other phase. By proper molecular design, the PNA
              amphiphile will dissociate from the DNA product upon heating the system above
              the melting transition temperature (Tm) of the PNA-DNA recognition complex. He
              will also describe a series of theoretical and experimental techniques that
              will be used to design PNA amphiphiles so that they specifically bind plasmid
              DNA, but have Tm in a useful range for ATPS. In addition to the development of
              a useful biochemical process, molecular-level design of the PNA amphiphile-DNA
              binding complex proposed here should also shed light on the contribution of
              intermolecular forces to the structure and function of biomolecular
              materials.
His education plan aims to cultivate molecular-level insight in the
              chemical engineering curriculum by a series of short modules to be assigned in
              core chemical engineering courses. Molecular modeling and experimental results
              of the research proposed here will be integrated into the modules, which are
              designed to predict fundamental engineering properties such as thermal
              conductivity, viscosity, and vapor-liquid equilibrium from molecular
              parameters. Another educational effort he proposes is a two-week mini-course
              for a colloid/interfacial engineering course that emphasizes the connection
              between biotechnology and colloid science.
