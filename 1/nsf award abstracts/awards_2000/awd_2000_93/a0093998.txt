Abstract    :
              The objective of this effort is to provide a rigorous understanding of
              atmospheric-pressure glow discharges (APGD).  This new class of plasmas can
              produce large amounts of active chemical species near room temperature and
              atmospheric pressure and has potential to revolutionize plasma-based processing
              technologies.  The research activities have the following components:  (1) a
              computationally fast, one-dimensional physical model for prediction of APGD
              axial structure; (2) a two-dimensional model for investigating bulk flow/plasma
              dynamics interactions; (3) analysis of the electron energy distribution
              function using a homogeneous, time-dependent electron Boltzman solver; (4) a
              bench-scale APGD experiment to assist in model validation and to explore the
              discharge phenomena, including visual characterization of discharge modes to
              establish stability boundaries as a function of discharge geometry and
              operating parameters, and electrical characterization of the discharge; and (5)
              investigation of a novel APGD-based silicon oxidation process with potential
              application in ultrathin integrated circuit gate-oxide formation.
