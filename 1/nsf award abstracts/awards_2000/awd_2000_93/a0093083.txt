This award supports the participation of American scientists in
              a U.S.-Japan seminar on advanced stability and seismicity concepts for
              performance-based design of steel and composite structures to be held in Kyoto,
              Japan from July 24-27, 2001.  The co-organizers are professors Roberto Leon of
              the Georgia Institute of Technology and Professor Eiichi Watanabe of  the Kyoto
              University in Japan.  The last decade has witnessed some of the most damaging
              earthquakes to urban areas in the last century.  Beginning with the 1994
              Northridge and 1995 Kobe Earthquakes, and concluding with the 1999 Chi-Chi
              (Taiwan) and Kocaeli (Turkey) ones, these events have exposed the vulnerability
              of both older and modern construction to near-field ground motions, and
              reinforced the need to mitigate and limit direct and indirect economic damage
              from earthquakes.  These earthquakes have led to extensive research efforts in
              both the U.S. and Japan. The seminar will focus on advances in the
              state-of-the-art achieved in the last six years, with major emphasis on
              achievements resulting from (a) experiences of, and research subsequent to the
              Northridge, Hanshin, Kocaeli, and Chi-Chi earthquakes and (b) the development
              of performance-based specifications for seismic design of steel and composite
              structures.

The final output from the workshop will be a monograph that
              discusses the current state-of-the-art in seismic design of steel building, and
              identifies weaknesses and voids in current American and Japanese practices.  It
              will also focus attention on new technologies that are promising for improving
              seismic performance. Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve
              younger researchers and postdocs as both participants and observers.  The
              exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will enable U.S.
              participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future
              collaborative projects.  Dissemination of information on the seminar will be
              available on the World Wide Web.
