Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to develop a new generation of algorithms
              and systems for mining distributed and heterogeneous data for ubiquitous
              computing environments. This research involves development of a distributed
              principal component analysis (PCA), distributed randomized projection
              techniques, clustering algorithms based on these distributed representation
              construction techniques, and a distributed decision tree learning technique
              based on Fourier analysis. This research is integrated with promotion of
              education in the data mining area through hosting undergraduates, K-12 students
              and teachers, organizing workshops, maintaining virtual presence, working with
              under-represented groups in collaboration with the University of Maryland
              Baltimore County Shriver Center, and the development of research/instructional
              laboratories. The results of this project will provide a new generation of data
              mining algorithms that minimize the cost for maintaining the ubiquitous
              presence. It will also enhance the awareness among the students at different
              levels about the importance of data mining education.
