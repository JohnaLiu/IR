Abstract    :
              1. An abstract for the project

This research focuses on enhancing the state
              of scientific knowledge
regarding cryptography and security in electronic
              commerce.  The
investigators study new models and abstractions, and find
              novel
e-commerce applications for a wide range of cryptographic
              techniques.
The research is focused on four main areas: (1) Secure
              multi-party
protocols -- How can mutually mistrustful agents cooperate?
              (2)
Anonymity and privacy mechanisms -- How can the protection of
sensitive
              information be guaranteed by design? (3) Fraud detection and
prevention -- How
              can illicit profit be systematically reduced? (4)
Secure content distribution
              -- How can virtual classrooms, concerts
and bookstores be streamlined?  Deeper
              connections are sought by
combining ideas from these areas.

Within the area
              of secure multi-party protocols, the researchers are
exploring efficient
              special-purpose protocols for e-commerce functions
of practical importance, to
              improve on the powerful but inefficient
completeness theorems of Goldreich et
              al. (1987), Ben-Or et
al. (1988), and others.  Anonymity and privacy
              mechanisms under
consideration include new methods for deniable payment
              mechanisms.
For fraud detection and prevention, the investigators
              examine
adversary models such as malicious-but-rational
              and
malicious-but-uncoordinated faults, and new uses of lightweight
              cost
functions.  The research in secure content distribution includes
              new
traitor tracing schemes, and new applications of zero
              knowledge
proofs.

2. To repeat what I said by email yesterday, my current
              and pending support
statement has changed.  I currently have no outside
              sources of funding.  (In
particular, I stepped down as P.I. of DARPA Grant
              #N66001-00-1-8921).
