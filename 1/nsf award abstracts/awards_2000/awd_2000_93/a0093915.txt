This project will develop a new class of chips capable of
              high-thruput learning on the chip itself, implementing new concepts of neural
              network learning which should allow the chips to learn how to control
              manufacturing plants or vehicles in a very generalized way, applicable to a
              wide class of tasks.  As a testbed, the project will develop neural network
              learning algorithms and chips to improve the performance of advanced
              semiconductor fabrication designs being developed by the PI's collaborators at
              Georgia Tech.  If successful, this work could significantly accelerate the use
              of learning systems for engineering applications in general.  It could
              eventually allow a substantial improvement in effective computational
              throughput per chip, above and beyond the improvements possible through Moore's
              Law (the increase in the physical feature density and speed of chips), for a
              very broad range of information processing tasks.

This project builds on the
              PI's prior work developing analog computable memories, or analog computing
              arrays, where instead of storing the analog values to be used by external
              processors, he uses the memory
element itself to perform the computation. 
              These systems are based on arrays of dense floating-gate transistors that
              provide nonvolatile storage, compute a product between stored weights and
              inputs, allow for programming that does not affect the computation, and adapt
              over time based on the information flowing through the chip.  In principle,
              this technology permits the development of general purpose chips with
              throughput comparable to that of dedicated analog ASIC chips, but with a kind
              of universal flexibility due to the adaptation of the weights and the universal
              approximation capabilities of the underlying architectures.
