Abstract    :
              This research and education Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project
              seeks to:  (1) advance understanding of how e-commerce and electronic exchanges
              impact supply chains and to develop decision technologies that will aid
              companies in effectively utilizing new opportunities provided by e-commence; 
              and (2) better prepare undergraduate and graduate students for today's digital
              economy and to disseminate new technologies developed through research. 
              

The proposed research will develop and investigate techniques to match
              buyers and sellers in exchanges, analyze dynamic pricing mechanisms that are
              currently used in or being developed for business-to-business e-commerce, and
              investigate the impacts of spot markets made possible by e-exchanges on supply
              chain coordination and performance.  It is also planned to implement techniques
              developed in industrial settings.  A closely integrated education effort will
              develop new undergraduate and graduate courses on e-commerce technologies, and
              prepare case studies based on real industrial practice.
