A symposium entitled "Biomaterials for Drug Delivery" is
              being conducted by the Materials Research Society (MRS) in Boston, MA from
              November 27-December 1, 2000 as part of its Fall 2000 National meeting. This
              award provides funds for partial support of graduate students, postdoctoral
              fellows, and assistant professors to attend the Symposium. A major purpose of
              the meeting is for leading international scientists to discuss advances in the
              areas of biomaterials, drug delivery, and biocompatibility.  The choice of the
              symposium topic derives from recent demands placed upon biomaterials
              performance that have paralleled the growth in applications and driven the
              development of sophisticated formulations with improved biocompatibility as
              well as superior mechanical and interfacial properties.  

The symposium
              addresses both the fundamental science of biomaterials and the advances in
              their applications to drug delivery.  To bring new ideas to these topics, the
              meeting includes a strong multidisciplinary program through joint sessions with
              three other symposia, "Orthopedic/Dental Biomaterials", "Cardiovascular
              Biomaterials", and "Neurologic Biomaterials".  Biomaterials and biological
              interfaces are expected to play a key role in promising areas of biotechnology
              such as cardiovascular/neurological applications.   

The Symposium on
              "Biomaterials for Drug Delivery" covers the development of novel biomaterials,
              improved evaluation, and utilization of existing biomaterials for controlled
              and targeted delivery of  bioactive agents.  The symposium will address current
              challenges in biomaterials synthesis, characterization, and biocompatibility
              issues with respect to drug delivery devices. Ways to design intelligent
              controlled release systems and studies combining characterization of
              physical/chemical properties of biomaterials and their impact on drug delivery
              performance will be emphasized.
