This proposal will investigate novel
              approaches in the integration of high-K dielectrics and metal gates with
              vertical CMOS devices. This integration offers low temperature compatibility
              since high-K gatestack formation in vertical devices can be performed after the
              source/drain regions are defined, thus avoiding any high temperature exposure.
              This offers tremendous opportunity for achieving ultimate CMOS performance.
              Within the integration scheme, several novel approaches will be evaluated. 
              Thin layers of metals placed on grown SiO2 layers will be used to convert SiO2
              to a high-K layer. Chemical vapor deposition of low metal content SiO2 layers
              will be evaluated for their high dielectric constant, low leakage current, and
              excellent mobility. Metal gates will be integrated using CVD processing and
              workfunction modulation will also be explored. The integration knowledge
              obtained will be evaluated on a novel self-assembled device in which both
              channel length and channel thickness are lithography independent.  In the
              education plan, several initiatives will be pursued such as: a)  organization
              of a workshop on integration challenges of vertical devices, b) development of
              a new course (classroom and web-based) in EE at NCSU entitled  "Beyond Bulk
              CMOS", c) development of a 30-min video tape on nano-chip technology, and d)
              development of a "nano-chip kit" that will include a microscope, Si wafer,
              discrete MOSFET, an integrated circuit chip, human hair and cross-sectional
              scanning and transmission electron micrographs of nanoscale feaures. The goal
              here is to excite young students (K-12) about nanotechnology by providing them
              with an early exposure to this fast growing field.
