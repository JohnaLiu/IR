Abstract    :
              As the interconnect characteristics dominate in deep-sub-micron regime, we are
              developing an interconnect-centric high-level synthesis (HLS) framework in
              which delay, power, and routability, can be optimized. We are investigating two
              approaches: (1) Incremental approach: HLS is performed iteratively by taking
              into account net-level estimates obtained from a detailed floorplan and global
              route information; and (2) Composite Approach: HLS tasks (scheduling,
              allocation, and binding) as well as physical design tasks (placement and
              routing) are unified into one composite step.  The novel features of the HLS
              framework are: (1) use of detailed interconnect timing models (moment-based,
              Elmore-delay based) in HLS flow; (2) routability driven HLS; and (3) usage of
              Rent's exponent as a routability metric.  As part of education plan, we are:
              (1) developing a two course sequence (dual-level); (2) experimenting in VLSI
              education with the case-based (Harvard Business school) teaching style
              (popularly used the MBA field); (3) involving undergraduate minority students
              in VLSI EDA research; and (4) exposing K11-12 students to the field of VLSI
              chip design automation.
