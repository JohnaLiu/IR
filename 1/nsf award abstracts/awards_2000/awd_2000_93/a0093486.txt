PECASE: 
              Foundations of Autonomous Biomolecular Computation

The project is developing
              autonomous, programmable biochemical systems that operate in a microscopic drop
              of liquid to achieve chemical tasks, such as nanostructure fabrication.
              Theoretical models of autonomous biomolecular computation to implement these
              models experimentally using DNA molecules, and to quantitatively characterize
              individual molecular logic components and the larger systems built from them
              are being performed.  Beyond the specific context of DNA, this research is
              creating a prototype of autonomous biomolecular computing systems and explore
              fundamental robustness issues in nanoscale computing, such as cross-talk
              between species and stochastic events due to thermal noise and diffusion. The
              project is aiming to leverage their advanced control over biochemical systems
              to begin establishing a broader foundation for reliable molecular
              computing.

Two new courses are being developed introducing students to the
              necessary concepts and tools required to begin work in biomolecular
              computation.  This research is establishing an experimental system for
              exploring computation by biological molecules, and is providing fundamental
              knowledge and principles for nanoscale computation, such as models of
              computation, molecular algorithms, physical limits, errors and error
              correction.  Although biomolecular systems are massively parallel,
              asynchronous, stochastic, and hard to design, the PI is researching on new
              programming principles, leading to a science of molecular computation.
