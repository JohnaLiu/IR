Abstract    :
              With this CAREER award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
              the work of Dr. Anna D. Gudmundsdottir in the Department of Chemistry at the
              University of  Cincinnati in Cincinnati, Ohio.   The research involves forming,
              detecting, and investigating the reactivity of alkyl nitrene intermediates in
              solution and in the solid state, emphasizing triplet nitrenes formed in the
              photolysis of alkyl azides.   The azides to be studied, using a combination of
              vis/uv and IR spectroscopies and product analysis, include azidoacetophenone,
              beta-, gamma-, and delta-azidoarylketones, benzyl azide, and fluorinated
              2-azidoethyl benzene.
Dr. Gudmundsdottir proposes to study the spectroscopic
              properties and reactivity of a class of highly reactive organic molecules which
              contain a saturated carbon atom bound to an unsaturated nitrogen atom.   These
              nitrenes will be generated in solution or in crystalline solids using laser
              flash photolysis, and may contain two electrons with parallel or antiparallel
              spins (triplet or singlet electronic states), often leading to different
              products.   Better understanding of these reactions in the solid state is
              expected to lead to better design of organic crystals for new materials.  
              Possible applications include photolithography, photoaffinity labels for
              biological molecules, and organic magnets.   Students will learn both from
              carrying out the research and by participating in a seminar course where they
              will be exposed to a number of successful scientists, including representatives
              from industry and from underrepresented minorities.  The seminars will help the
              students decide what career paths to follow once they leave the University of
              Cincinnati.
