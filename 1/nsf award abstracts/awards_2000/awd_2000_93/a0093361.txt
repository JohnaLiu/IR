Abstract    :
              All too often, decisions about whom to trust in computer systems are
driven by
              the needs of system management rather than data security.
In particular, data
              storage is often entrusted to people who have no
role in creating or using the
              data--through outsourcing of data
management, hiring of outside consultants to
              administer servers, or
even collocation servers in physically insecure machine
              rooms to gain
better network connectivity.

SUNDR is a network file system
              designed to run on untrusted servers.
SUNDR servers can safely be managed by
              people who have no permission
to read or write data stored in the file system.
               Thus, people can
base their trust decisions on who needs to use data and
              their
administrative decisions on how best to manage the data. 
              Moreover,
with SUNDR, attackers will no longer be able to wreak havoc
              by
compromising servers and tampering with data.  They will need
              to
compromise clients while legitimate users are logged on.  Since
clients do
              not need to accept incoming network connections, they can
more easily be
              firewalled and protected from compromise than servers
