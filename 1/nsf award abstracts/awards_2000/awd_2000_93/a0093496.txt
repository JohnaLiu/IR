Abstract    :
              The nature of distributed work is changing as mobile and ubiquitous technologies
              are being used increasingly to enable collaboration anywhere, anytime. The
              success of distributed teamwork depends on the ability of collaborating
              partners to communicate essential social and task information, referred to as
              awareness information. Thus, the design of next generation mobile and
              ubiquitous technologies need to be based on a deep understanding of social and
              task requirements. The purpose of this project is to investigate how technology
              can support awareness requirements as people's environments change during
              distributed work. Empirical studies of physically collocated and distributed
              collaboration will be done to develop a theoretical framework for how awareness
              information is conveyed and utilized in these different settings. Five field
              sites have been selected in domains where distributed work is commonplace:
              space mission design, aerospace, software development, microprocessor
              development, and disk storage technologies. Prototype awareness mechanisms will
              be developed based on the requirements obtained in the field studies. These
              technologies will be evaluated both in the field and the laboratory to test the
              theoretical framework of how awareness information is utilized in distributed
              work. This research will be integrated into a graduate study program focused on
              computer-supported collaborative work and human-computer interaction.
