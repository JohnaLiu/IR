Abstract    :
              Describing and understanding the distribution of fishes across whole river
              basins is a central issue in landscape ecology, population biology, and
              invasive species research. The PI proposes to develop methods to detect aquatic
              species by PCR amplification of DNA from cellular materials in stream water.
              The project focuses on determining the presence or absence of salmonid fishes
              (trout and char) in streams by amplification of species-specific DNA sequences
              from cells shed by fish into the water. The particle concentration and assay
              sensitivity required for this work appear feasible based upon recent use of
              filtration and PCR methods to detect protozoan parasites (giardia,
              cryptosporidia) in public drinking water. However, the extreme dilution of
              biotic materials in clear mountain streams may be problematical because the
              quantity, fate and condition of cellular debris shed by fish into the water are
              unknown. In addition, the optimal methods to separate these materials from
              plankton, algae, and decaying plant materials that may compete with salmonid
              DNA in assays and may inhibit PCR also need to be developed. The proximate goal
              is to develop a procedure to detect fish in remote and inaccessible streams,
              without resorting to laborious and inefficient field methods. Applications of
              the methods developed will have much greater range, however, as the results
              will suggest modifications for assays of many other aquatic species.
