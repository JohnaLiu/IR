Abstract    :
              As more and more people use computer networks to exchange confidential data and
              perform business transactions, public key cryptography is rapidly becoming one
              of the most critical tools in today's electronic world.  Using cryptography it
              is possible to perform many important tasks ranging from electronic voting, to
              digital contract signing, secure virtual conferences on public networks and
              many more.  All these applications ultimately rely on the security of the
              underlying cryptographic primitives (i.e. the fundamental building blocks using
              which all other more complex cryptographic applications are built).  This
              research involves the study of computational problems from an area of
              mathematics called geometry of numbers that can be used both to design new
              cryptographic primitives, and to test old ones and assess their
              security.

The investigators study the complexity of point lattices.  These
              are geometric objects that can be described as the set of intersection points
              of a regular n-dimensional grid.  This research involves both the
              identification of hard lattice problems, and the search for better algorithms
              to solve lattice problems that admit efficient solution.  Hard lattice problems
              are subsequently used to design new cryptographic functions, while new lattice
              algorithms are used to design new cryptanalytic attacks against existing
              cryptographic primitives.
