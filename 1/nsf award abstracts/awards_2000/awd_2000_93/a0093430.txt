Abstract    :
              This is the first year funding of a 5-year continuing award. Current core speech
              recognition technology is inadequate in several important situations, where
              high error rates often render the technology unusable.  This project will
              advance the state of the art through use of graphical models, a relatively new
              statistical technique comprising formal methods for reasoning about random
              processes, and sets of algorithms for making probabilistic data-driven
              decisions in computationally efficient ways.   All existing statistical
              techniques used in automatic speech recognition (and many more) appear to be
              representable using graphical models;  no other known abstraction has such a
              property.  The PI will design and build new freely available open-source
              software for speech recognition research and education.  This infrastructure
              will provide the tools needed to successfully investigate different
              graphical-model based speech recognition algorithms, and will include tools for
              both computing with a specified model and for searching for new ones.   The
              infrastructure will be used for curriculum development at the University of
              Washington (both at the graduate and undergraduate level), and will be
              released, along with course materials, on the Internet for free use by
              anyone.
