Abstract    :
              The Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics is an annual
              conference designed to encourage undergraduate women math majors to go to
              graduate school and to help increase their success in
graduate school.  The
              conference brings together women undergraduate math majors from all over the
              United States.  It includes two plenary talks by distinguished women
              mathematicians as well as panel discussions relating to graduate school and
              career development. The main part of the program is a series of talks by the
              undergraduate women about their own research, showcasing the speakers'
              achievements and encouraging others to emulate their success.

Successful
              conferences have already been held in 1999 and 2000 at the University of
              Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), with about fifty and seventy-five undergraduate women
              attending, respectively.  The UNL Mathematics Department has a strong record of
              helping talented women to succeed in mathematics, as recognized, for example,
              by the 1998 Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics,
              and
Engineering Mentoring.
