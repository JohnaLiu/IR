A combined theoretical and experimental study of the
              macromolecular glycocalyx surface layer on the luminal side of capillary
              endothelial cells is planned.  Using brightfield and fluorescence microscopy,
              mechanical and electrostatic deformations of the glycocalyx will be observed in
              vivo in order to obtain estimates of the permeability properties and
              fixed-charged density of the layer.  Combined with these experiments, a
              multi-dimensional mechano-electrochemical model of the glycocalyx will be
              developed using continuum mixture theory.  These investigations are aimed at
              providing a quantitative theoretical framework to explore the biophysical role
              of this structure in such diverse and important processes as immune response,
              cell adhesion, mass transport, and mechanotransduction of flow.  In addition,
              an integrated educational plan will be implemented to facilitate students' deep
              and thorough understanding of engineering fundamentals, in the areas of fluid
              dynamics, continuum mechanics, and biomechanics, by fostering active learning
              through the development of interactive instructional Mathematica notebook
              modules.
