Cognitive functions of the nervous system depend largely
              on the integrity of neuronal communication. This process includes the release
              of neurotransmitter from synaptic vesicles, activation of postsynaptic
              receptors, and recycling of synaptic vesicles.  The recycling step is crucial
              for continuous synaptic transmission.  However, our understanding of vesicle
              recycling and its regulation remains rudimentary.  Dr. Zhang will exploit the
              power of genetics, molecular biology, and electrophysiology in the fruitfly
              Drosophila to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying vesicle
              recycling.  Recently, Dr. Zhang and his colleagues revealed that
              clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a major vesicle recycling pathway, is tightly
              regulated by LAP (like-AP180), a putative fly homolog of the mammalian clathrin
              assembly protein AP180.  Dr. Zhang will test whether LAP is a functional
              homolog of AP180 and determine precisely how LAP regulates vesicle reformation.
                He will also identify structural motifs critical for clathrin coat assembly
              and determine their roles in synaptic transmission. The results from these
              studies have broad biological and clinical significance because clathrin is
              commonly used for endocytosis and intracellular protein trafficking. 
Dr.
              Zhang's research is also closely integrated with training of students and
              outreach to local schools.  He will develop new curriculum for both
              undergraduates and graduates at his University.  He will also expand an
              on-going annual workshop to familiarize local elementary and high students and
              their teachers with basic neurobiological research.   Through these education
              and outreach efforts, Dr. Zhang hopes to inspire more young students to pursue
              careers in biological research and education.  This CAREER award will not only
              advance our understanding of synaptic transmission, but also help develop
              programs benefiting future neurobiologists.
