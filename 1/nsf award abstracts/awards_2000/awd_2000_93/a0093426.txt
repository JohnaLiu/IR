CAREERS:  Techniques and
              Application of Dynamic Compilation

Compiler-based program optimization is
              fundamentally important for current and future computing systems.  Static
              optimization, the predominant approach, will always be essential but is
              becoming increasingly insufficient for many reasons.  These include the
              popularity of high-level, object-oriented languages, the proliferation of
              portable, interpreted languages like Java, and the increasing complexity of
              processor architectures.  All of these trends imply that dynamic compilation
              (including runtime program analysis, runtime optimization, and runtime code
              generation) is likely to be extremely important technology for achieving high
              performance in current and future application.

The infrastructure developed
              through this work will support a broad career plan that integrates teaching and
              research.  The software will contribute to the PI's educational efforts through
              class projects in introductory and advanced classes and through recruiting
              undergraduates for these research efforts.
