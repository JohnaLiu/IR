Abstract    :
              Jianshu Cao of MIT is supported by a CAREER grant from the Theoretical and
              Computational Chemistry Program to explore the competition of multiple
              time-scales in single molecule kinetics and model the role of anharmonic
              molecular couplings in vibrational dynamics.  This research is strongly
              motivated by recent experiments measuring reaction dynamics with
              single-molecule resolution and on time scales ranging from femtoseconds to
              seconds.  As part of his education plan, Cao will develop a statistical
              mechanics course for the general student which will include computer-based
              tutorials, scientific computing, and integration of his own research
              topics.

Advances in optical spectroscopy and microscopy have made it
              possible to monitor directly the motion of individual molecules at room
              temperature.  Accurate theoretical tools are required to address deviations
              from classical models now detected by new experiments.  To prepare students for
              these challenging new research directions, effective teaching practices will be
              coupled with new curriculum development.
