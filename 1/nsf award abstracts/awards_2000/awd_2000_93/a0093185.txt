Abstract    :
              This grant will support a one-day workshop in connection with the GeoEng 2000
              Conference, to be held in Melbourne, Australia in November, 2000.  The primary
              objective is to identify Geo-Engineering research areas of mutual interest
              between U.S. and foreign investigators and to recommend to NSF ways to enhance
              international collaborative research efforts.  Approximately 15 U.S.
              investigators will participate in the workshop.  The majority of the
              participants will be relatively young investigators interested in international
              collaboration.  Foreign contacts, and therefore the resulting information and
              collaboration, are anticipated to be primarily from Australia, New Zealand, and
              Southeast Asia due to the location of the workshop and GeoEng 2000.
