Abstract    :
              Objectives: The PI's research objectives are: to develop a multiscale modeling
              approach to help elucidate: (i) the way in which amino acid sequence and
              binding affinity of antibodies are correlated and evolve during the humoral
              immune response to specific antigens, and (ii) to explore the role of somatic
              mutation and antigen pressure on the evolution of specific B-cell cancers, in
              particular, of follicular lymphomas.
His educational objectives include: (1)
              undergraduate students are exposed to and trained in molecular modeling
              techniques, (2) graduate students are trained in multidisciplinary approaches
              to interdisciplinary problems, (3) the use of disparate length-scale modeling
              approaches is emphasized, and (4) the educational objectives are well
              integrated with the research activities.
