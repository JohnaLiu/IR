Abstract    :
              This research project focuses on a set of scanning tunneling microscope (STM)
              experiments employing discrete molecules of hydrogen, silicon, and oxygen
              (H8Si8O12 and H10Si10O15). The STM-tip/cluster/silicon interaction at the heart
              of these studies is roughly analogous to a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)
              capacitor. However, the proposed model has a controllable coupling between the
              "metal" (STM-tip) and "oxide" (cluster). In these studies, the structure of the
              insulator can be independently determined to a much greater degree than is
              possible for the insulator in actual MOS capacitors. The results of these
              studies will provide a foundation for understanding STM images taken of device
              interfaces and the basic mechanism of the hydrogen-silicon bond breaking event
              that leads to device failure. Understanding of structure and failure mechanisms
              are key for optimizing the next generations of transistors for microelectronic
              devices. 


The silicon/silicon oxide interface is a crucial part of the
              modern transistor. Over the past decade, the thickness of the silicon dioxide
              insulating layer has shrunk by more than two orders of magnitude and is now
              approximately10 Angstroms in the smallest research devices. As the thickness of
              the insulating layer has approached molecular dimensions, the average
              stoichiometry and physical properties of the silicon oxide undergo important
              changes that must be understood in order to optimize, or even successfully
              build, the next generations of silicon-based transistors.  Students trained in
              these areas are likely to compete very well for jobs in various communicatons
              technology sectors.  This research project is jointly supported by the Solid
              State Chemistry Program of the Division of Materials Research and the Advanced
              Materials and Processing Program of the Chemistry Division.
