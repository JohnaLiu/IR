The broad objective of this research is to elucidate
              membrane protein structure and dynamics
using advanced solid-state NMR
              spectroscopy. Membrane proteins regulate cellular transport and
cell
              signaling, thus they are essential for cell survival. Knowledge of their
              three-dimensional
structures is crucial for understanding their functions.
              Solid-state NMR is a promising method for
studying the molecular structure of
              membrane proteins in their native environment of lipid bilayers.
In this
              CAREER project, the structure and dynamics of a 22 kDa membrane-bound protein,
              colicin
Ia channel domain, will be investigated using NMR techniques suitable
              for extensively isotopically
labeled proteins. a-helical and b-sheet segments
              in colicin will be identified and specific structural
constraints will be
              measured using chemical shift anisotropies, correlated dipolar couplings, and
              1H-1H internuclear distances. The depth of insertion of the protein into the
              lipid bilayer will be
determined by 1H spin diffusion techniques. The dynamics
              of the colicin backbone and sidechain
will be characterized using anisotropic
              couplings, lineshapes, and relaxation time constants. These
studies should
              provide insight into the mechanism of conformational changes of colicin Ia and
              other proteins that refold to accomplish their functions. Related to these
              research objectives are
educational initiatives to modernize the undergraduate
              chemistry curriculum. A protein structure module for general chemistry will be
              designed to integrate research with teaching, and create web
pages for
              undergraduate physical chemistry courses. The participation of women in
              chemistry will be encouraged by recruiting women summer interns into the
              laboratory.
