Abstract    :
              This project will explore the use of novel learning-based intelligent control to
              meet the challenge of controlling Active Magnetic Bearings (AMBs).  If they can
              be controlled more effectively, AMBs have the potential to make it feasible to
              use advanced flywheel energy storage systems to signigicantly improve the
              efficiency of hybrid electric vehicles; this, in turn, could measurably ease
              the world's transition to higher oil prices.  The challenge of controlling AMBs
              more effectively is well-known to be the main obstacle which needs to be
              addressed, in order to make this all happen.

The development of brain-like
              learning systems-systems which output contols or actions, as organic brains
              do-is general fundamental scientific importance.  AMB control will be used as a
              testbed for benchmarking the capabilities of more brain-like designs compared
              with more traditional designs, and for studying the characteristics of existing
              brain-like design with an eye to possible improvements.  Because the AMB
              problem is very nonlinear and difficult for traditional methods, there is a
              significant possiblity that novel methods will perform better (after
              considerable analysis) and that results of this project could assist in the
              difficult paradigm shift to learning-based nonlinear approaches.
