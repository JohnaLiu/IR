Abstract    :
              The phenomenal growth of the world wide web has made it the most
              popular
Internet application today. Web proxy caching is an important vehicle
              to
mitigate web traffic explosion.  Current web caching services are
              becoming
increasingly inefficient for two reasons. First, the continuous
              increase
in dynamically generated content makes an increasing fraction of
              web-based
media uncacheable. Second, the increasing diversity of web
              traffic
requires a QoS-aware caching infrastructure while the current caches
              are
best-effort.

In this project we shall design, implement and evaluate an
              active
caching/replication architecture that resolves the aforementioned
              major
limitations.  The service augments web caches with the ability
              to
replicate not only static data but also data sources in a
              demand-driven
QoS-sensitive fashion.  The cache acts as a QoS-aware retailer
              that
imports whatever active content is in local demand at the current
              time.
Demand-driven data source replication allows dynamic content to
              be
generated on the cache. Hence, it shifts the need for computing power
              from
centralized origin servers to proxies in the vicinity of end-users
              thereby
improving scalability and allowing cache-assisted customization
              of
user-perceived information access performance.  By offering data
              source
location as a dimension to manipulate, the architecture achieves
              better
solutions for the web performance optimization problem that
              are
well-suited to diverse end-user needs.
