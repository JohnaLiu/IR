Abstract    :
              Now that numerous genomes have been sequenced, a significant challenge
              confronting biologists is to determine the functions of the genes contained in
              these genomes. One aspect of understanding the function of a given gene is to
              determine the conditions under which it is active, the mechanisms responsible
              for controlling its level of activity, and the interactions it has with other
              genes.  Toward this end, in the current project the PI will develop new
              computational approaches to uncovering the regulatory mechanisms and
              interactions of genes in a given organism.  In particular, the focus is on
              developing new machine learning methods which are able to predictively identify
              various regulatory elements of a genome, using well-characterized aspects of
              the genome as training data.  The expected impact of this research is twofold: 
               it will produce new methods and software that can be applied by molecular
              biologists to gain insight into the regulatory apparatus of the cell;  and it
              will advance the state of the art in machine learning by developing new methods
              for problem domains that involve (i) multiple inter-related learning tasks,
              (ii) rich and varied sources of data including sequence and text data, and
              (iii) the need for rich representation languages, such as stochastic
              context-free grammars and relational rules.
