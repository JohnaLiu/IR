This award is to Indiana University Purdue
              University-Indianapolis to support the activity described below for 36 months. 
              The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation
              Program Solicitation (NSF 0082).

Partners
The partners include Indiana
              University Purdue University - Indianapolis; Indiana University; Terre Haute
              Center for Medical Partner Organizations; Indiana University School of
              Medicine; Eli Lilly & Company; Indiana 21st Century Fund for Research and
              Technology; Indiana Business Modernization and Technology
              Corporation.

Proposed Activities
The activities for this award include
              innovative research in regenerative biology; technology transfer leading to
              development of therapies; training the workforce for regenerative
              biology.

Proposed Innovation
The goals of this innovation are research on
              regenerative biology to understand the regeneration process and identify
              proteins of therapeutic value for healing, and technology transfer to private
              companies for healthcare delivery.

Potential Economic Impact
The potential
              economic impacts are creation of an estimated 7000 new jobs over the next 10
              years from the partner companies alone (10% of these will be in Indiana), and
              increased participation of minorities in the health care industry.

Potential
              Societal Impact
The development of therapies for injured and degenerating
              tissues will have medical and health benefits to society beyond anything known
              today.  The plan also includes strong involvement of minorities in the
              workforce training programs with subsequent participation in the anticipated
              expanded healthcare job market.
