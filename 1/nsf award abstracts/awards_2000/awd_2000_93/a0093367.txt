Abstract    :
              People who are quadriplegic and nonverbal, for example from cerebral palsy or
              traumatic brain injury, often have great difficulties communicating their
              desires, thoughts, and needs.   A video-based human-computer interface system
              will be developed to provide such people access to computers.   The interface
              system will detect and track their limited voluntary motions to help them
              communicate with family, friends, and care providers.   A set of cameras with
              pan, tilt, and zoom mechanisms will be pointed at the computer user.   Computer
              vision algorithms will recognize the movements of a finger, foot, or facial
              feature in real time and interpret them as a communication of the computer
              user.   Augmentative communication software will be developed that uses these
              interpretations to provide access to commercially available or custom-built
              application software.   The system will be trained and tested by several
              non-speaking children with cerebral palsy and other serious disabilities.  
              This research is expected to advance the state-of-the-art in the fields of
              computer vision and assistive technology with new video interpretation
              algorithms and innovative real-time system design.   It will help people with
              severe disabilities gain access to a computer and thereby obtain a tool for
              communication, which in turn will enable them to actively acquire knowledge, to
              partake in increased recreational activities, to surf the internet, and to use
              computer-controlled technologies such as automated wheelchairs.
