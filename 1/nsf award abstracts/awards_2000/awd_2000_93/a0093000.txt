Abstract    :
              Dr. Sonya Franklin, Department of Chemistry, University of Iowa, is supported by
              the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program, Division of
              Chemistry, National Science Foundation, through a Career Award for her work on
              the design of artificial endonucleases as biological probes of gene regulation
              and transcription that will lead to an understanding of embryonic developmental
              processes. Specifically, small metalloproteins, chimeras of the Ca-binding
              EF-Hand motif, and the helix-turn-helix motif of homeodomain transcription
              factors will be designed as selective and tunable endonucleases. In the
              educational area, a new graduate level bioinorganic special topics course will
              be developed, modern bioinorganic experiments will be incorporated in
              upper-level undergraduate laboratory courses, and freshman and sophomore
              students will be exposed to a survey of bioinorganic chemistry.

Exploiting
              the well-established recognition of DNA-binding proteins to deliver hydrolytic
              metals for site-specific cleavage will have significant and broad-reaching
              potential in molecular biochemistry. Students will gain experience with oral
              and written presentation of literature and research topics in group meetings
              and at scientific conferences; bioinorganic chemistry will be the basis to
              expose students to lateral thinking, to thoughtful analysis, to gain confidence
              in problem solving, and to improve communication skills.
