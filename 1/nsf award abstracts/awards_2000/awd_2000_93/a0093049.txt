Abstract    :
              Dean Roddick, University of Wyoming, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic
              and Organometallic Chemistry Program for continued work on organometallic
              compounds in superacidic environments. Using fluorinated chelating phosphines
              such as di(perfluoroethylphosphino)ethane (dfepe), Roddick has prepared
              platinum alkyls such as (dfepe)Pt(Me)(OTf) and [(dfepe)Pt(Me)(CO)]+ that are
              stable in superacidic solutions. A range of alkyls will be prepared to
              determine the relative proteolytic stability. The chemistry will be extended to
              explore carbenium ion chemistry in the coordination sphere of a metal.
              Hydrides, polyhydrides and dihydrogen complexes will also be studied in this
              unique environment. High pressure NMR and ATR-IR will be used to survey the
              interactions of these very electrophilic compounds with weak bases such as
              methane, xenon, nitrogen and oxygen.

This work explores the limits of
              organometallic chemistry in the extreme superacid environment. The
              superelectrophilic metal complexes provide insight into alkane transformations
              on metal surfaces. Such transformations are critical in petroleum cracking and
              other important industrial processes.
