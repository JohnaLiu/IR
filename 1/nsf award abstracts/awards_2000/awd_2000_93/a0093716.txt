Abstract    :
              This project will focus on monitoring of electrical insulation with mobile
              sensors. Their
network will accommodate a full range of spatial and temporal
              resolution requirements posed by power
quality sensitive customers and a
              highly competitive yet cost-conscious deregulated power industry. Several
most
              relevant sensor technologies will be combined in a single system to
              nondestructively evaluate aging
status, presence of incipient faults, and
              exact location of failing sections in insulating cables and power
equipment. A
              mobile micro-manufactured platform will be used for periodic comprehensive and
              need-driven
longitudinal scanning of insulation status, whereas traditional of
              stationary sensors will provide
systemwide information for multi-sensor
              diagnostics. The project will lead to a new concept of distribution
power
              systems, especially for underground cables, in which the entire network will be
              periodically tested
by automatic "crawlers". Prime sensing mechanisms will
              include fringing electric field dielectrometry,
acoustic sensing, and infrared
              sensing. Additional sensors are likely to be installed once the first
              prototype
of the mobile platform is complete. Communication links and source
              of power for device operation would
determine maximum range and
              miniaturization aspects of mobile platforms.
