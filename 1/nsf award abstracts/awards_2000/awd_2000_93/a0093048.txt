Abstract    :
              The Synthetic Organic Program is awarding a grant to John Montgomery at the
              Department of Chemistry, Wayne State University.  This grant will continue his
              research into asymmetric nickel-catalyzed cyclizations.  Mechanistic studies
              and the development of new catalytic, enantioselective processes will be
              pursued.  The preparation of a number of (poly)cycles to illustrate the utility
              of the methodology will be carried out.

Professor Montgomery's research
              provides an excellent training ground for students in organic and
              organometallic chemistry.  These students then enter the pharmaceutical and
              chemical workforce, as well as academia.  This research into nickel-catalyzed
              cyclizations to form new cyclic compounds is most likely to find applications
              in the preparation of pharmaceutical agents.
