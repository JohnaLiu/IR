This award supports a planning visit by Thuy Le and Donald Kirk,
              San Jose State University, to Vietnam.  The purpose of the planning visit is to
              determine the potential for joint long-term research and education cooperation,
              including distance education, between Vietnam and the US.  Through visits to
              universities and research institutes in Hanoi and in Ho Chi Minh City, the US
              PIs will explore the status of higher education in engineering in Vietnam, and
              investigate barriers to distance learning.  Information gathered during the
              trip will be available through a website following the visits.
