Abstract    :
              This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program, addresses the development of an effective methodology for the
              synthesis and characterization of ordered mesoporous silica materials.  Surface
              functionalization of these materials, determination of type, bonding density,
              and uniformity of surface coverage of the surface functionalities, and the
              determination of the size of pore windows in these materials are the main
              objectives of this research.  Characterization methods developed in this
              research have applicability to a broad range of high surface area materials,
              and are not limited to the mesoporous silica materials that are the focus of
              Professor Mietek Jaroniec's research at Kent State University.

The
              development of methodologies for the determination of surface coverage and type
              of modifier is the focus of this research project supported in the Analytical
              and Surface Chemistry Program.  Synthesis of mesoporous modified silica
              materials, followed by characterization using the methodologies developed here,
              is the goal of the work.  These methodologies will have wide applicability
              beyond the modified silicas that form the main topic of research.
