CAREER and
              RUI: Capture Probing to Link Methanotrophic Species with Ecological Function in
              Acidic Northern Wetlands


Progress in ecology is limited by our inability
              to associate individual microbial species with the ecological functions they
              perform in nature. The PI will conduct research to link microbial species with
              ecological function by measuring the synthesis of ribosomal RNAs. This grant
              will support research that establishes a new approach to understanding
              microbial activities in nature.  By measuring the incorporation of 13C into
              species-specific ribosomal RNAs, it will be possible to assign activities to
              natural microbial populations.  This tool will be used to understand the
              ecology of methane oxidizing bacteria.  These organisms are responsible for
              slowing the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from acidic northern
              wetlands.  Some methanotroph genera (Methylomonas, Methylococcus) appear to be
              adapted to high oxygen and low methane concentrations, while other species
              (Methylosinus, Methylocystis) prefer the converse.  13C-capture probing will be
              used to investigate the activity of methanotroph populations in nature.  By
              better understanding the ecology of these organisms, it will be possible to
              predict and perhaps control the release of methane from a globally significant
              source.

This is a CAREER award and the PI will develop novel courses and
              devote a significant effort toward community outreach.  The PI will use
              cooperative learning as an alternative teaching approach to maximize student
              interaction and increase achievement and retention.  This grant will provide
              leadership training to promote cooperative learning in science education. 
              Course improvements will act as a catalyst for reform across the curriculum. 
              This grant will create a research and education infrastructure to attract and
              build relationships with a growing biotechnology industry in the region.  This
              grant will also support active recruitment and mentoring of underrepresented
              student groups to retain them in the sciences.
