Abstract    :
              Until recently, performance has been the single most important issue in the
              design of hardware and software.  However, with the proliferation of
              battery-powered embedded and portable devices and the ever-increasing clock
              frequencies of general-purpose processors, the problem of effective energy
              optimization has become very important for a wide variety of architectures. 
              The goal of this project is to design and implement an energy-aware optimizing
              compiler framework that take as input a source code written in a high-level
              language, energy and performance constraints, architectural description and
              technology related parameters, and generates as output an energy/performance
              optimized executable and an estimation of energy consumption.  Some key
              contributions include (i) high-level energy models that can be used by a
              compiler, (ii) a simulator infrastructure to validate compiler output, (iii)
              new, energy-oriented compiler optimizations, and (iv) investigating the
              necessary os and architectural support for effective cooperation between the
              compiler, os, and architecture so as to address the growing energy problem in a
              unified manner.  The proposed energy/performance-aware approach represents a
              radical shift from pure performance-oriented strategies used so far in
              optimizing compilers, and will open new avenues of research in computing in a
              world that is increasingly becoming more energy-conscious.
