Abstract    :
              This CAREER award supports research to develop a new theory of the tunneling
              density of states in strongly correlated electron systems.  One thrust of the
              research aims at reconciling theory and data from experiments on tunneling into
              quantum Hall edges.  The PI will also work on the related problem of tunneling
              into fractional quantum Hall effect systems with smooth edges.  The educational
              component of the research involves creating a work-study program to effectively
              expose undergraduate physics majors to theoretical materials research. 
              Well-conceived projects that are integrated into the PI's research provide
              vehicles for one-on-one and peer interaction.

This CAREER award supports
              theoretical research and education in condensed matter physics. The PI will use
              advanced theoretical methods to study tunneling into exotic non-Fermi liquid
              states that occur in quantum Hall systems.  The research may contribute to the
              theoretical foundation underlying future nanoelectronic devices.  The
              educational component of the research involves creating a work-study program to
              effectively expose undergraduate physics majors to theoretical materials
              research.  Well conceived projects that are integrated into the PI's research
              provide a vehicle for one-on-one and peer interaction.
