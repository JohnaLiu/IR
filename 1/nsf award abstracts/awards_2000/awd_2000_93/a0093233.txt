Abstract    :
              The project focuses on geometry-based robotic manipulation and motion planning. 
              The proposed research includes development of algorithms for manipulation,
              motion planning, and design of articulated objects with many degrees of
              freedom. Example objects include cardboard cartons folded from blanks, and
              ``pop-up'' 3D micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) made from 2D hinged
              elements. In contrast with work on rigid object manipulation, this research
              will enable robots with only a few degrees of freedom to manipulate non-rigid
              articulated objects with many degrees of freedom. Applications include
              eliminating repetitive stress injuries due to carton folding during packaging,
              and batch fabrication of 3D micro-optical MEMS devices for optical networks.
              The education plan closely complements the research program and includes
              development of new courses, mentoring graduate students, involving
              undergraduates in research, and organizing robotics workshops.
