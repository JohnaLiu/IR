Abstract    :
              This research program will investigate hermetic coatings designed to limit the
              diffusion of water and hydrogen into optical fibers in order to improve fiber
              resistance to fatigue and hydrogen-induced attenuation.  An improved hermetic
              coating will be found by fundamentally understanding the transport phenomena
              involved in the manufacture of such films by chemical vapor deposition.  Guided
              by new experimental and theoretical analyses, this project will develop a
              better understanding to manufacture superior hermetic optical fiber coatings
              using fundamental knowledge of process property relationships.  Fundamental
              knowledge gained from this project will be used to link process parameters such
              as draw rate, fiber temperature, and reactant gas concentration to the coating
              phase, structure, hermeticity, and deposition rate. Since these relationships
              will be able to identify new methods and optimal conditions to improve hermetic
              fiber performance, results from this study are expected to enhance fiber
              performance and reliability, and hence improve our information technology
              infrastructure.
