Abstract    :
              A major objective of the Gordon Conference in Chemical Oceanography is to bring
              together every two years leading members of the scientific community, along
              with post doctoral fellows and graduate students, to discuss new and exciting
              research in an informal setting.  In 2001, the Gordon Conference in Chemical
              Oceanography will discuss research activities in three main areas:  (1) The
              Climate Connection to Chemical and Atmospheric Chemistry Present and Past; (2)
              Chemical Processes in Marine Sediments; and (3) Analytical Developments and
              their Applications.  The Gordon Conference has become recognized as an
              important venue to exchange ideas in the interdisciplinary field of marine
              chemistry and forge new scientific alliances.  For this reason the National
              Science Foundation, along with the Office of Naval Research and the Gordon
              Research Conference, will co-sponsor the participation of 20 graduate students
              and 33 session chairs and speakers in the 2001 Gordon Conference in Chemical
              Oceanography.
