The overall objective of the integrative research and
              education career plan is to utilize basic engineering principles (cell
              mechanics and electrical interfacing technology) and biological principles
              (neurobiology) to optimize neuronal culturing techniques for examining
              neuropathological conditions and create a interdisciplinary approach to solving
              problems and advancing the field of neuroengineering.   The initial goal of the
              research component is to further develop three-dimensional (3-D) cultures of
              the signaling cells of the brain (neurons) by manipulating the cellular support
              matrix that surrounds the neurons.  The optimized 3-D cell cultures will be
              used to determine how external physical stimuli (from the physiologic to the
              pathologic/injury range) are transduced from the support matrix to the cellular
              organelles.  In this controlled system, specific mechanisms of
              mechanically-initiated cell signals will be sorted out in order to develop
              cellular thresholds and mechanistically-based pharmacologic interventions.  In
              addition, the introduction of 3-D microelectrodes will be incorporated into the
              cell cultures for purposes of measuring neuronal activity. Educational efforts
              will be concurrent with the research activities and stem from the research
              projects. Undergraduate students will be introduced to problem solving and
              technological approaches in neurobiological interfacing with microsystems
              through problem-based learning classes.  In addition, the PI will expand a
              graduate course in bioengineering laboratory principles to modules that can be
              used for undergraduate research experiences and training of high school science
              teachers.
