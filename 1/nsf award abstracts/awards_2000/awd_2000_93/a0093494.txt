Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to develop research based frameworks for
              understanding the mathematical reasoning of students enrolled in "transition"
              mathematics courses at the college level, that focus on the introductory
              aspects of mathematical logic, and proof (e.g., Linear Algebra).  This study of
              student reasoning will look at issues associated with student justification and
              explanation as they relate to students learning of proof.  Further, the
              researcher will investigate the progressive mathematization of students, as
              these students struggle intellectually with notions of symbolism and definition
              in the context of mathematical proof.
