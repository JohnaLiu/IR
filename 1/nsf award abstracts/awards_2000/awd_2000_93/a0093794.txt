The PI proposes an
              integrated research and educational program to examine the effect of air-water
              interface contamination on turbulence and gas transfer.  Gas exchange processes
              across interfaces are fundamental to environmental, biological, and industrial
              fluid mechanics.  Experiments will be conducted in a water tank with grid
              generated turbulence with and without surfactants.  Velocity and CO2
              concentration will be measured by digital particle tracking velocimetry (DPTV)
              and Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) techniques to obtain the vortical
              transport of fluid and flux of CO2 at the interface.  The ultimate goal is to
              use the experimental data to develop an analytical model for gas transfer at
              the interface.
