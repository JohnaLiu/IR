Abstract    :
              PI's objectives are to: (1) Investigate the kinetics of PMN-tumor cell aggregate
              formation as a function of shear rate, and states of PMN/tumor cell activation.
              These data will be analyzed using a mathematical model based on Smoluchowski's
              two-body collision theory that will provide numerical estimates of an important
              cellular property termed adhesion efficiency, which reflects the binding
              affinity of interacting cells. (2) Elucidate the fundamental molecular and
              signaling mechanisms of PMN-tumor cell adhesive interactions using function
              blocking monoclonal antibodies and highly specific enzymes will, (3) Track
              individual PMNs in shear flow and delineate the dynamics and pattern of their
              interactions with surface-anchored tumor cells using a perfusion chamber
              coupled with an epifluorescence videomicroscopy system.
For the educational
              component of this proposal, the PI aims to develop an innovative
              university-wide curriculum in Cellular Engineering at both the undergraduate
              and graduate levels. This goal will be met through the development of a
              cohesive set of lecture courses and the establishment of a capstone laboratory
              course in which students will obtain valuable hands-on experience, by being
              exposed to a wide array of experimental tools and techniques used in
              bioengineering research. To promote exposure of Bioengineering to high-school
              students, an outreach program will be developed in parallel. The strategy
              involves the educational enrichment of regional high-school teachers and the
              development of an internet-based module using animation and audio/video clips
              on selected topics of Cellular Engineering in an effort to introduce this
              material as a section in an advanced science course.
