The proposed work is a three year effort to establish and
              operate a very low frequency (VLF) beacon transmitter at South Pole, for the
              continuous measurement of solar effects on the Earth's mesosphere and lower
              ionosphere.  Specifically the transmitter will produce data on solar proton
              events, relativistic (>300 keV) electron precipitation from the Earth's outer
              radiation belts,  and energetic electron precipitation and Joule heating
              components of high latitude/polar cap magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling
              processes. The relativistic electron population as measured at geosynchronous
              orbit exhibits pronounced fluctuations in association with substorm and solar
              activity.  During an event, these highly energetic electrons can penetrate to
              altitudes as low as 30-40 km, producing ionization, x-rays and possibly
              affecting chemical reactions involving ozone production.  The extent of
              relativistic electron precipitation will be observed by means of amplitude and
              phase variations of the South Pole VLF signal as received at various Antarctic
              stations. The South Pole beacon will synergistically enhance other antarctic
              upper atmospheric research efforts, such as the Automatic Geophysical
              Observatory programs and the southern hemisphere coherent HF radar network
              (SUPERDARN). The proposed program also strongly complements ongoing satellite
              based measurements of trapped and precipitating high energy electrons both at
              low altitudes (SAMPEX) and high altitudes (POLAR).   The beacon will transmit
              at approximately 20 kHz, radiating 1 kW of total power with a ~6.25 km
              (tip-to-tip length) long horizontal dipole antenna. It will be operating under
              computer control with a synoptic schedule of about 1 min out of every 15
              minutes.
