Although massive stars are
              rare, they have an importance far beyond their scant numbers. Through action of
              their strong outflowing winds and their eventual explosive destruction as
              supernovae, they provide much of the energy input into the interstellar medium.
              With short lifetimes of only a few million years and high mass-loss rates, they
              are primary sources of heavy element enrichment in a galaxy. Dr. Massey is
              presently concluding a survey for red supergiant, blue supergiant and
              Wolf-Rayet stars in nearby galaxies of the Local Group. This project is
              scheduled for completion during the current calendar year. Follow-up
              observations are now required and, during the period covered by this new award,
              stars found in the survey will be observed with large telescopes to obtain
              spectra and photometry. It will be possible to learn how the evolution of
              massive stars varies with mass, age and heavy element content without the
              observational biases that have plagued this type of investigation in the
              past.
