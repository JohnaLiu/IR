Abstract    :
              Despite the growing complexity of the storage landscape, tools to architect new
              storage systems are practically nonexistent.  The purpose of this CAREER grant
              proposal is to develop a long-range program of research and education in design
              and performance analysis of storage systems, with a specific emphasis on
              emerging probe-based storage technology.  The main question this research
              proposal asks is:  "How do we design probe-based storage to give optimal
              performance for a workload with certain characteristics?"  Answering this
              question requires a long-range research plan with thrusts in several areas,
              including creating physical models for the device, developing tools and
              methodologies for optimizing design based on a specific workload, and novel
              research in workload characterization to generalize our conclusions.  Although
              our initial focus is on probe-based storage, we envision creating a
              parameterized, plug-and-play performance environment in which many other models
              may be used.

The education component of this proposal represents a
              philosophy of curriculum development to increase awareness of storage systems,
              and a general emphasis on fostering active learning skills.
