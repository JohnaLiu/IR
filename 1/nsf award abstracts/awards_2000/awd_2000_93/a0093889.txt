Abstract    :
              This CAREER award will focus on active material systems for power generation,
              sensing, actuation, and control.  The integrated program will combine research
              in ionic polymer material systems with undergraduate- and graduate-level
              curriculum development. 

The hypothesis of this research is that the
              chemoelectric and electromechanical transduction properties of perfluourinated
              ion-exchange membranes can be modeled with a unified theory that models ion
              transport and water transport. 

The research objectives are:

Develop a
              unified multidimensional model of chemoelectric and electromechanical energy
              conversion in ionic polymer materials.
Determine the physics that limit the
              response time of ionic polymer materials in beam and plate
              structures.
Correlate these models with experiments on representative material
              configurations.


The educational component of this CAREER plan is the
              development of a senior-level undergraduate and first-year graduate course
              entitled, Analysis and Control of Active Material Systems. The course will be
              based on a topological description of active material systems and will
              emphasize the five fundamental aspects: sensing, control, actuation, energy
              storage, and power flow.

The impact of this research is the development of a
              new class of active materials that seamlessly combine energy storage, sensing,
              and actuation.  These new material systems will have application in motion
              control, noise and vibration suppression, and the development of autonomous
              biomimetic systems.
