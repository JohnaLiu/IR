This project will advance the	core of a new emerging area of
              crossdisciplinary research called neuromorphic engineering, originally
              pioneered by Carver Mead of CalTech.  Neuromorphic engineering builds a new
              bridge between neuroscience and the development of new microchips which try to
              replicate the capabilities of the hardware of the brain; it also attempts to
              improve our understanding both of information processing and of hardware issues
              (like energy dissipation, precision, and nanoscale operation) in the brain
              itself.  Neuromorphic engineering is still at a very early stage, but it has
              the potential for revolutionary benefits both to engineering and to
              neuroscience sometime in the future.

This project will focus particularly on
              reverse-engineering the higher visual system of the brain, using hardware
              capable of emulating spiking neurons in the brain, and addressing issues such
              as attention or awareness and consciousness.  It will also include substantial
              work in developing the new educational base required to allow serious progress
              in this kind of crossdisciplinary work.
