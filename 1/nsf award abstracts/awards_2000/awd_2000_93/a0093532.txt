Abstract    :
              This is an investigation of the subgrid-scale (SGS) mixing of conserved scalars
              which play a critical role in large-eddy simulation (LES) of nonpremixed
              turbulent combustion.  Mixing of conserved scalars is generally considered to
              be dominated by a large-to-small-scale cascade process based on Kolmogorovs
              hypothesis.  Current mixing models give qualitatively incorrect results for
              flows where the cascade process should dominate.  Also, it is now recognized
              that large-scale velocity and scalar fields have significant influence on
              small-scale scalar mixing.  In this project, the effects of the large-scale
              structure and of the cascade process on the filtered density function (the SGS
              distribution) of a conserved scalar is studied.  High-resolution measurements
              of velocity and of conserved scalars are made in high-Reynolds-number turbulent
              jets with isotropic grid turbulence.  Hot-wire and cold-wire arrays, particle
              image velocimetry (PIV), and planar laser Rayleigh scattering are used for the
              measurements.  Issues in modeling the filtered density function of a conserved
              scalar and the filtered joint density function of a conserved scalar and its
              gradient are investigated.  Both conventional statistical analyses and those
              based on conditional sampling and averaging are performed to investigate the
              effects of turbulent advection, turbulent strain and rotation, and molecular
              mixing on the filtered density function and other variables.
