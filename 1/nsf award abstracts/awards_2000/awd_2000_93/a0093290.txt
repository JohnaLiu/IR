Abstract    :
              The project addresses development of systems that interact autonomously with
              their environment in an intelligent way. Applications range from intelligent
              home environments to autonomous mobile robots to software agents.  Over the
              recent years, the use of probabilistic methods has led to development of
              reliable mobile robot systems. However, despite tremendous potential benefits
              of collaboration between robots, some fundamental issues in the context of
              probabilistic methods for multi-robot collaboration remain unexplored. The goal
              of this project is to bridge the scientific gap between  probabilistic methods
              for single-robot systems and those for collaborative multi-robot systems.  The
              research is expected to have a strong impact on the area of collaborating
              mobile robots. On the education side,  in order to teach the skills needed to
              understand and develop such complex systems,  a new undergraduate course on
              mobile robotics will be designed, which will follow a hands-on approach to
              teaching, involving students in investigative work with mobile robots.
