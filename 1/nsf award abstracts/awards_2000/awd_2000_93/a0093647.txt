The principal investigator plans to develop the theory of
              group
actions on symplectic manifolds and geometric invariant theory,
and
              extend applications to certain 2d conformal field theories
and algebraic
              combinatorics.  In particular, he will investigate
the theory of loop group
              actions, group-valued moment maps, and
relations to the Wess-Zumino-Witten
              model in conformal field
theory and cohomology pairings on moduli spaces of
              flat
connections; the asymptotic limit of the quantum 6j symbols;
              and
decomposition of products of conjugacy classes in disconnected
compact
              groups and twisted forms of quantum cohomology.  He will
integrate his
              research with a variety of educational projects,
such as dynamical systems in
              the calculus and linear algebra
sequence at Rutgers; strengthening the joint
              major with computer
science; laboratory activities in the undergraduate
              curriculum
and evaluation of their effectiveness.

Symplectic geometry is
              the mathematical framework for the study
of classical mechanics, and in
              particular Hamiltonian dynamical
systems.  Woodward will undertake a number of
              projects to develop
the field and its role in the undergraduate and
              graduate
curriculum.  He will seek to understand symmetries, especially
              of
infinite dimension, in this setting.  Possible applications
outside of
              mathematics are the development of new computational
techniques in conformal
              field theory, an important topic in
recent high-energy theoretical physics,
              and improvement of the
efficiency of wireless communication, via the
              construction of
better packings in the unitary group.
