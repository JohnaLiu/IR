Abstract    :
              This research explores full-wave simulation techniques to facilitate the
              application of such tools to high-performance VLSI system design. It also
              investigates new design methodologies for system-level power delivery
              structures and on-chip interconnects for next-generation VLSI design.
              Computational work builds on an advanced full-wave simulation method:
              finite-difference time-domain (FDTD). The research focuses on 1) full-wave
              simulation algorithms to enable VLSI system-level full-wave simulation, 2)
              effective use of the full-wave simulation engine to investigate power
              fluctuation and signal integrity issues for VLSI interconnects, 3) exploration
              of time-of-flight effects, frequency-dependent behavior, and electrical and
              magnetic cross-coupling at the chip level, 4) investigation of power dip/ground
              bounce for the purpose of identifying design blocks that are vulnerable to
              power fluctuations, 5) evaluation of  the impact of decoupling capacitors on
              power delivery.
