Abstract    :
              As we enter the so-called "information age" of global networks, ubiquitous
              computing devices, and electronic commerce, computer security is of increasing
              importance.  One of the greatest challenges in computer security today is the
              software assurance problem:  How do we deal with the fact that our most trusted
              software, even our security software itself, is often buggy?

This research
              will study two aspects of the software assurance problem: ensuring first that
              bad things do not happen, and second that good things do happen.  The project
              will explore vulnerability detection of legacy software, focusing on detecting
              the types of security bugs that pervade systems built before security became as
              serious a concern as it is today.  Also this work will study infrastructural
              support for building new systems that need to be secure.  The enabling
              technology is a mix of lightweight formal methods (such as static program
              analysis) coupled with domain-specific heuristics, and a main goal will be to
              build tools that can be used in practice.  In each case, a key selling point of
              the approach is that it allows us to proactively eliminate or neutralize
              security bugs before they are exploited.
