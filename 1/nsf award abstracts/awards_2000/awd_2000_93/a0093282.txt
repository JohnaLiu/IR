Abstract    :
              Next generation computer systems will be characterized by pervasive
networked
              devices interconnected by a variety of networks and organized in
loose and
              dynamically changing confederations.  This research addresses the
question of
              how to program these new computer systems. In particular,
foundations and
              implementation techniques for programming heterogeneous
distributed systems
              are being investigated.  Specific results are expected in
the following
              areas:

Trusted Software Composition: This research focuses on  developing a
              security infrastructure
for software composition consisting of a policy
              meta-language and
language-level enforcement mechanisms such as type-driven
              static
enforcement and automatic wrapper code generation.

Mobile Calculi:
              The project will investigates the foundations of a core
Internet programming
              language with a good algebraic theory, a natural
mapping into a distributed
              implementation, and expression of security
properties as types.

This work
              is expected to have applications in a variety of fields; from
              distributed
applications with high information assurance requirements to
              active
networks and distributed system monitoring and administration.
