Abstract    :
              This study addresses the evolutionary significance of the production of
              nonfertilizing sperm.  In in many organisms (including fruitflies and humans)
              males produce many fertilization-incompetent sperm.  The effect of these
              nonfertilizing sperm on successful reproduction is unknown. Two types of
              experiments will be performed in a common fruitfly, Drosophila pseudoobscura:
              1) replacing its existing mating system with decreased and increased
              opportunities for mating with multiple partners and subsequently measuring the
              affect this alteration has on the production of sterile sperm, and 2) a
              comparison of sibling species, some of which produce sterile sperm, of life
              history and mating system. The teaching component of this work focuses on the
              scientific method and the nature of science, and improving the understanding of
              evolutionary processes. Two components, primarily focused on middle and
              secondary school teachers, provide this emphasis: 1) pre- and in-service
              workshops on the nature of science and evolution for middle and secondary
              school teachers geared to Nevada Science Content Standards, and 2) summer
              research experience for in-service teachers.

The research proposed examines
              fundamental processes of reproduction, primarily evolutionary factors affecting
              the production of sterile sperm.  To that end, this project will elucidate a
              vexing and common occurrence in animal taxa; the deliberate production of
              nonfertilizing sperm.  The teaching component will contribute to the
              understanding the nature of science and incorporating knowledge of evolutionary
              processes, such as antibiotic resistance, that will be critical for individuals
              to make decisions about issues affecting their personal lives, society and the
              environment.
