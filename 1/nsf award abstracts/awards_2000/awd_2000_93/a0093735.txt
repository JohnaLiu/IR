Abstract    :
              The overall goal of this project is to improve the recruitment and retention of
              low-income, academically capable students, especially women and
              African-Americans, in computer science. In addition to existing programs and
              support structure, new activities, based on research related to these issues,
              are helping to improve the campus climate for the students. Support activities
              include weekly visits of scholarship recipients with their advisors, peer study
              groups, tutoring, group projects, positive classroom climate and faculty
              training workshops. The training workshops foster faculty awareness of, and
              sensitivity to, the difficulties that women and African Americans face in
              computer science, mathematics and physics, while encouraging faculty to
              generate specific ideas for enhancing the learning environment. When the
              scholarship funding ends, students go on to intern and co-op positions with
              local businesses and industries.
