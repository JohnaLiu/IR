Abstract    :
              The general concept of energy production and the various forms of energy are
              easy for most students to grasp.
In fact, environmental groups have
              effectively worked with K-12 science programs to make today's children aware of
              and concerned about the environmental consequences of energy production in the
              U.S. and around the world.  Today's students have also been exposed to energy
              efficiency and conservation, and can relate to the fact that changes come with
              economic consequences. Therefore, various engineering concepts can be
              introduced to students at all levels using a forum that they can visualize, but
              more importantly, see the practical connection that is often needed for a
              student to fully comprehend a concept.

The PI proposes to integrate his
              research on thermodynamic and economic modeling into the classroom.
              The
thermodynamic modeling proposed deviates from the traditional approach of
              maximizing energy efficiency by
focusing on optimizing exergy losses and
              economic efficiency while minimizing the environmental impact.
Results from
              the modeling are used to identify novel concepts and future research areas that
              will be required to overcome barrier issues that currently limit the
              optimization of the electric power industry. While the PI is a new PhD, his
              modeling efforts will draw on over 20 years of experience on advanced power
              systems accumulated while working for a contract research organization.
