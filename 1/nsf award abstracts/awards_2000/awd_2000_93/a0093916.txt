Abstract    :
              The overall goal of the research and education program is to design
              component-based patient monitoring technologies for the home. To realize this
              goal, the principal investigator (PI) will create a new Medical Component
              Design Laboratory, which will function as a bi-directional conduit to funnel
              lessons learned between research projects and a set of closely related
              engineering courses. Light-based sensors have been chosen as the initial
              vehicle to demonstrate continuous and unobtrusive monitoring of diverse patient
              data. The two-pronged program will target (1) the design of smart,
              plug-and-play software and hardware components that function within a
              distributed medical information infrastructure, and (2) the development of
              novel, light-based ambulatory sensors that can acquire meaningful physiological
              data from a patient. 

Specific technical objectives include: 1) develop a
              secure, distributed infrastructure for home-based monitoring systems that
              utilizes plug-and-play component interoperability standards, 2) build
              hardware/software components that support smart medical device operation in the
              home, 3) demonstrate secure interaction between medical devices and electronic
              patient records, 4) create and clinically validate new algorithms for
              extracting diagnostic parameters from continuous physiological data acquired
              with wearable, owner-aware, light-based sensors, and 5) apply research methods
              for using continuous physiological data to determine and predict state of
              health.
