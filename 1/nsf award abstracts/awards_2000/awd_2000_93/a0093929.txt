The long necked, gigantic sauropod
              dinosaurs appear to have been the largest animals that ever lived. Because of
              the large size, great weight, and fragile nature of sauropod fossils, their
              biology, and specifically their modes of feeding and locomotion, have been
              difficult to study. In this project, we will use a new computer program,
              Dinomorph, to digitally animate detailed images of the elements of the
              skeletons of several sauropods, allowing us to assess the ranges of movement of
              their necks and limbs, and to examine alternate scenarios for their feeding,
              posture, and locomotion. 

We will also compare the bony and soft tissue
              structures of the shoulder region and neck of representative birds and
              crocodilians (the two closest living relatives to sauropod dinosaurs) through
              both dissections and CT scans in order to assess which elements they have in
              common that might also have been present in the sauropods. We will also study
              neck mobility and muscle-bone connections in the necks of the two extant long
              necked mammals: giraffes and camels. These data will be used to help constrain
              parameters in the model.  The resulting estimates of maximum range of motion
              for sauropods will be useful for understanding how these dinosaurs interacted
              with their environment and, therefore, what types of impacts they might have
              had on their environments.
