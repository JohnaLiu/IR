Abstract    :
              
Strategies Developed by Chemistry Graduate Students in Pedagogical and
              Empirical Content Knowledge. The study investigates the professional
              development of graduate students in two distinctly different areas, pedagogical
              content knowledge or PCK, and empirical content knowledge, ECK. Empirical
              content knowledge is defined as the knowledge of strategies, knowledge of
              research tools, and content knowledge that define successful research practice
              in a field.  The definition of PCK for successful teaching is the knowledge of
              teaching strategies , the particular student population, areas of common
              difficulty, and teaching tools. The context for study of both areas is one of
              situated learning as graduates students work in teaching laboratories and
              research laboratories. Inquiry also concerns the characteristics of the
              learning environment for new graduate students, particularly learning
              conversations about research and/or pedagogy. Since problem solving is the
              essence of successful research or teaching practice, one assessment of
              strategies will originate from solution-pathway analyses created by graduate
              students as they solve problems authored by the research & teaching directors
              in a virtual learning environment.
