Abstract    :
              Over the past decade, our ability to produce graphical
images has improved to
              the extent that we can create
imaginary scenes that are virtually
              indistinguishable from
reality. Digital humans have been called the last
              frontier
in this march to graphical realism, and the area of human
animation
              has also seen dramatic developments. Increasing
use of motion capture data and
              new techniques for
manipulating that data allow us to reproduce human motion
              at
an extremely high level of fidelity. Graphically generated
characters in
              video games and films can seem uncannily real.
Pending the development of
              easy-to-use tools for directing
digital humans, we should soon see digital
              humans as
plausible user interfaces, and animated characters will
become much
              more prevalent in education, demonstration, and
training applications. If
              digital humans are the last
frontier in realistic computer graphics, the last
              frontier
in realistic digital humans is generating believable hand
motion.
              Human hands are beautiful and complex mechanisms,
amazing in their utility and
              adaptability. It is argued that
it is our hands that make us human, and that
              hand evolution
was a primary factor in the development of intelligence.
Hand
              use in autonomous digital human characters, however, is
generally quite
              unconvincing. Hands may be placed in a
single frozen pose, and interaction
              between characters and
objects is avoided when possible. The main problem is
              that
geometric models of the human hand have far too much
flexibility. This
              flexibility makes working with hands
difficult even for trained animators, and
              it poses a
tremendous challenge for creating autonomous characters that
must
              interact with their environment. I believe that the key
to making further
              progress in hand motion for digital
characters is much more detailed
              consideration of the
anatomy of the human hand. In analysis of human grasps,
              for
example, critically important considerations include the
amount of
              contact between finger pads, palm, and object; the
ability of muscles to
              produce or resist task force; and the
stabilization roles of fingers and
              muscles, yet none of
these issues have been explored in grasp synthesis
              research
in either the robotics or computer graphics communities. In
pursuit
              of the goal of believable hand use for digital
characters, we propose an
              anatomy-based model of human
grasping. In particular, we propose a
              tendon-based quality
measure for humanlike enveloping grasps, and we plan
              to
evaluate this quality measure (1) for ability to
discriminate between
              grasps, (2) as a predictor of grasp
forces, and (3) for use in modeling grasp
              acquisition.
Because of the strong emphasis on human anatomy, this
research
              has the potential for additional impact outside
graphics and animation in
              areas including ergonomics (tool
design), robotics (robot hand design), and
              anthropology
(research in human hand evolution and tool use). The
educational
              portion of this proposal focuses on teaching and
mentoring of undergraduates.
              The research ideas, techniques,
and results will be incorporated into a course
              at Brown that
attracts both un-dergraduate and graduate students, and
              will
provide them with an opportunity to learn and experiment in
a problem
              domain that is a nice mix of computational
geometry and numerical
              optimization, grounded in human
anatomy and supported by data. A special
              effort will be made
to include undergraduate women in the research program,
              for
example, through the CRA Distributed Mentor Program.
Research results
              will include a library of example grasps
and applied forces, as well as a tool
              for adapting the
examples to new hand and object geometries. Once
              this
research is published, the data and tools will be made
available to
              other researchers on the web, and should serve
as a useful resource for
              creating digital characters for
education, entertainment, and training
              applications.
