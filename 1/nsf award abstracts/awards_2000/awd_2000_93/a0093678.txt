Abstract    :
              The CAREER proposal will develop a framework to characterize durability of
              composites in civil infrastructure by integrating fiber-optic embedded sensors
              with damage mechanics models and life prediction methods.  To tackle this
              problem, a combined analytical and experimental methodology is proposed, as
              follows: 1) Integrate embedded sensors in composites fabrication by VARTM and
              filament winding; 2) Implement strain, temperature, moisture and chemical
              degradation fiber-optic sensors; 3) Evaluate the embedded sensor system with
              controlled damage; 4) Develop a damage mechanics model and life-prediction
              methodology for durability analysis based on interrogating senors; 5) Assess
              reliability of sensor data and scale to composite structures (bridge decks and
              pipe walls); and 6) Validate the durability methodology and synthesize into a
              health-monitoring protocol.  The educational approach is two-fold encompassing
              student recruitment and advanced graduate education.  First, and educational
              collaboration is being developed with an applied technology center at a high
              school in Maine.  The objective is to introduce high school students to the
              engineering experience by collaborating with civil engineering juniors in a
              composite bridge design and fabrication project.  Second, an advanced graduate
              course on composites in civil engineering will be developed.
