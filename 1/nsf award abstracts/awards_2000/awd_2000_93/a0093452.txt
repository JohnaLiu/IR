Transportation infrastructure systems are long-lived and
              large-scale in nature.  Deteriorating infrastructure can thus have serious,
              widespread, and prolonged negative impacts on social, industrial, and economic
              activities of society.  The overall objectives of the proposed research plan
              are to contribute to the knowledge base of the behavior of infrastructure
              systems to use to guide the development of methods for improving their
              management.

The research aims to provide an integrated view of the entire
              infrastucture provision process, including: 1) multivariate condition
              assessment and deterioration modeling; 2) spatial sampling strategy selection;
              3) modeling the effect of initial design and construction decisions on
              deterioration; 4) optimal design-build-operate-maintain strategy selection; 5)
              modeling agency behavior.  The elements will be addressed on a data-driven
              basis, i.e., as information is gleaned.  Statistical and operations research
              methodologies will be employed.

The education plan involves advocates a
              systems approach to civil infrastructure and disseminating the results to
              graduate and undergraduate courses and research, professional development
              offerings for engineers and researchers.
