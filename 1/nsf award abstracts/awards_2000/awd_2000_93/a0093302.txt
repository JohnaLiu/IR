Abstract    :
              As the Human Genome Project nears completion the need grows for functional
              genomic analyses which in addition to the primary genomic sequence involve
              other types of data such as gene expression measurements from microarray
              hybridization experiments. Research in functional genomics involves a range of
              computational problems including visualization, clustering, classification,
              regression, knowledge representation, and predictive modeling.   This project
              will touch on each of these areas, but the primary focus will be on developing
              machine learning techniques that learn to place genes into discrete functional
              categories in order to simplify and render more tractable the problem of
              inferring gene function from genomic data.  To the end the PI will build on his
              prior work which showed that a support vector machine (SVM) can be successfully
              trained using DNA microarray expression data to recognize various gene
              functional categories, and will develop methods for combining coding sequence,
              promoter region, gene expression, and other types of genomic data in SVM-based
              learning algorithms.   The research will lead to improved understanding of the
              ability of various machine learning techniques to recognize different types of
              gene functional classes, and will also yield new techniques for learning
              simultaneously from multiple types of data.  Learning from heterogeneous data
              sets is a core issue in artificial intelligence and machine learning;  the
              ability to combine knowledge from various types of genomic data is critical for
              understanding the cell at the molecular level, and should lead to important
              insights into gene function.
