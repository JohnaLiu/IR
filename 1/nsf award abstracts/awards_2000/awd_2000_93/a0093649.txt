Much recent progress has been made towards the development of
              techniques for the controlled synthesis of nanoparticles.  A need now exists
              for methods of creating functional materials from nanoparticles while
              preserving their small grain size.  In this project, a hybrid high temperature
              particle synthesis/low temperature interconnection process will be developed
              for production of mechanically strong porous films.  With this process, porous
              films will be produced with no grain growth, thus preserving properties
              associated with nanoparticle size.  The initial focus will be on porous films
              of titania, with applications to photovoltaic materials and chemical sensors. 
              This general technique may also be applicable to the production of porous films
              of many other materials such as silica or tin oxide.

The research
              component will lead to an improved understanding of the mechanisms of particle
              transport and processing/structure/property relationships for
              nanoparticle-based materials.  This will be integrated with the educational
              component through the development of an undergraduate elective in the area of
              particle science and technology, and by incorporating numerical methods used
              for this research into the required graduate level transport phenomena course,
              in the form of project-based team activities.  Outreach activities will consist
              of visits to high schools and junior high schools in Washington, D.C., as these
              students are now able to attend the University of Maryland as 'in state'
              students.  These visits are directed towards increasing the number and
              diversity of qualified applicants to the College of Engineering, and towards
              increasing the awareness of chemical engineering as a career option.
