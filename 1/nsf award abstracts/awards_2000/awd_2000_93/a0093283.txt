Abstract    :
              Professor Elliot R. Bernstein of Colorado State University is supported by the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry program to perform experimental and theoretical
              studies on small radicals and their reactions in the gas phase.   The
              fundamental question pertains to the detailed description of bimolecular
              reactions.  In order to achieve the desired level of detail, it is required
              that the dimensionality of the reactive coordinates be reduced, and the PI
              proposes an experimental means to do so.   Small radicals such as NCO and NO3
              will be complexed with hydrogen-containing coreactant species in a beam, and
              the reaction is photoinitiated.  The ensuing hydrogen abstraction products are
              analyzed using laser induced fluorescence or mass-resolved excitation
              spectroscopy.  Ab initio theory will be employed to follow the reaction on the
              reactant complex excited electronic state potential energy surface to find the
              path for the generation of the product radical. 

In addition to advancing
              fundamental knowledge about bimolecular reactions, this research will
              contribute to a fuller understanding of the role played by such complexes and
              excited electronic states in atmospheric and combustion chemistry.
