Abstract    :
              This program focuses on the recruitment of underrepresented populations to
              mathematics and computer science, and the retention of majors through the
              critical first year of study. Approximately one third of the scholarships are
              committed to recruitment of community college graduates and the remaining
              scholarships are committed to recruiting freshman. In both cases special
              attention is given to underrepresented populations. Retention is addressed
              using a combination of peer mentoring, tutoring, and mathematics oriented
              socialization. Members of the mathematics honor society serve as peer mentors.
              These exemplary students are role models for the freshman and junior transfers.
              Each of these individuals forms the core of a study group that includes one
              junior transfer and two freshmen scholarship recipients. Development of proper
              study habits is an essential element of the mentoring process.
