Abstract    :
              Computational geometry arose out of the need for many
science and engineering
              applications of geometric computing.
Over the last two decades, the field has
              emerged as a rich,
mature, and mathematically rigorous discipline.
              However,
despite its impressive achievements well-received in the
theoretical
              computer science community, computational
geometry has had limited impact in
              the practical areas of
geometric computing. As advocated by the
              recent
Computational Geometry Task Force Report, it is important to
reorient
              the field towards providing more practical
solutions to the specific needs of
              the applications that use
geometric computing, and towards focusing on
              new
"bottleneck" problems of identifiably important practical
areas. In this
              proposed career plan, we intend to develop
our research career toward this
              goal, by working on the full
computational pipelines of some important
              real-world
applications of geo-metric computing, including air
              traffic
management (conflict prediction), graphics and
              scientific
visualization (I/O-efficient isosurface extraction, I/O-
efficient
              direct volume rendering, external-memory view-
dependent surface
              simplification), and manufacturing
(maximum scatter traveling salesperson
              problem (TSP)). An
important aspect of the work is to examine the
              full
computational pipelines of the practical applications to
identify and
              formulate critical tasks into new algorithmic
questions, extend computational
              geometry methodologies to
devise novel solutions, and finally implement and
              integrate
the developed algorithms into the pipelines to evaluate
their
              practical ef-fectiveness in the original real-life
applications. Key
              components of the plan are the expected
rich interactions between theory and
              practice, and the aim
of designing simple, easy-to-implement geometric
              algorithms
that are efficient both practically and theoretically. In
the long
              term, we expect to be able to have real impact on
these important practical
              areas of geometric computing, and
at the same time enrich the knowledge body
              of the field of
computational geometry. The proposed educational
              plan
includes introduction of new courses, involvement of both
graduate and
              undergraduate students in the proposed research
projects, participation in an
              outreach program, and further
development of a research laboratory.
