Abstract    :
              The design and implementation of a modern microprocessor presents many
              reliability challenges.  Designers must verify the correctness of large complex
              systems and construct implementations that work reliably in
varied operating
              conditions.  The research examines the role that speculative execution could
              play in improving the quality and reliability of future microprocessor designs.
              A novel processing paradigm, called
dynamic verification, is proposed that
              pushes speculation into all aspects of program processing. The approach couples
              a traditional core processor design with a simple checker processor that
              verifies its
computation. The resulting core processor design has significant
              resistance to permanent and transient errors.  The proposed research examines
              the design of the checker processor, with emphasis on
minimizing its cost and
              impact on core processor performance.

The educational component of this work
              seeks to better prepare the student for coming challenges in computer system
              design. The VeriSimple Processor tool kit will provide students with a unified
              computer design
experience, starting with high level design in undergraduate
              classes, to microarchitectural design in advanced undergraduate classes, and
              finally research-oriented design in graduate coursework.  The tool kit
will be
              incorporated into the SimpleScalar tool set (simulator tools developed by the
              PI) and freely distributed to other institutions.
