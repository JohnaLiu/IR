Abstract    :
              This project provides 20 scholarships to talented, low- income students pursuing
              associate degrees in computer science, computer information systems,
              engineering, or mathematics. Special consideration is given to women, ethnic &
              racial minorities and persons with disabilities. The implementation and
              management plan for this project is clear and effective, strengthened by its
              leadership and participation of faculty and staff from Women's Programs and
              Services for Students with Disabilities. This group has developed a unique plan
              for individualized support and thorough planning for each scholarship
              recipient, including the development of an Individualized Success Plan, a
              Faculty Mentor Program and opportunities for internships with local employers.
              Strong collaborations with private business and industry are an important
              component of the program.
