Abstract    :
              The goal of this research program is to develop compiler optimization technology
              for emerging software applications.  Compared to the current
              state-of-the-practice, the new software applications will be written in
              type-safe languages (e.g., Java), will contain millions of lines of code, will
              often be built from components distributed across multiple machines, and will
              run on processors that will have multiple threads of control, but will take
              hundreds of cycles to access the main memory.  Modern software will require
              modern optimizations that will need to be scalable in three ways: with the size
              of the program, with the number of distributed components, and with the growing
              memory latency.  This research proposes to achieve scalability by exploiting
              radically novel forms of speculation, profiling, demand-driven analysis,
              run-time checks, and hardware support.  To develop these technologies, three
              specific efforts will be undertaken: elimination of array-bounds checks,
              demand-driven pointer analysis, and prefetching for pointer-based data
              structures.
