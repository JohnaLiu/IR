Abstract    :
              The project focuses on deepening of our understanding of the process of
              distributed manipulation. A representative set of three types of distributed
              manipulation systems will be considered: 1) an actuator array (a fixed planar
              array of many small stationary elements which cooperate to manipulate a large
              object); 2) a superposition of planar potential fields to manipulate objects
              (here air flow, using potential field theory); 3) snake-like or tentacle-like
              robots to wrap, fully or partially, around the manipulated object. On the
              education front, a wide  effort on bringing mechatronics into the mechanical
              engineering curriculum will be made.
