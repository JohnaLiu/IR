Abstract    :
              New technology for capturing shape data from the real world
requires new
              algorithms to interpret and use it. Building on
new ideas about reconstructing
              a surface from a set of
points in three-dimensional space, we consider
              algorithms
for computing different shape representations, and for
aligning
              point sets to each other. We look for simple,
effective yet provably correct
              algorithms, using tools from
computational geometry but drawing on the huge
              body of
previous work in computer vision and graphics. This work
complements
              our teaching in graphics and algorithms, and
helps us train graduate students
              in research.
