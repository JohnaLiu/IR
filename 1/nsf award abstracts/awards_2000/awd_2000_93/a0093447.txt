The objectives of this research include understanding the
              catalytic mechanism of (a) The monoheme cytochrome P460, (b) the multiheme
              c-cytochrome, hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO). (c) the tetraheme cytochrome
              c554, (d) the monoheme cytochrome c552 and (e) the di-c-heme cytcperoxidase.  
              These are reactive cyochromes which participate in the energy-generating
              reactions of the autotrophic bacterium, N. europaea.  The bacterium catalyzes a
              step in the nitrification pathway of the global nitrogen cycle.  Its activity
              is key in agriculture, waste water treatment, on-site bioremediation of
              environmental pollutants, greenhouse gas formation and ozone depletion.  The
              active site of the hydroxylamine oxidizing enzyme contains a novel heme-like
              macrocycle, heme P460, a derivative of a c-heme which has a unique, covalent
              crosslink to a protein tyrosine.  A similar crosslink, but to a lysine, is
              observed in another
hydroxylamine oxidizing enzyme from N. europaea called
              cytochrome P460. Both heme P460s have similar unique optical properties. . 
              Catalytic hemes play critical roles in many cellular processes functioning as
              either reductases or oxygenases.  HAO, on the other hand, catalyzes a
              biologically relevant dehydrogenation reaction, a function unprecedented among
              catalytic cytochromes, and rarely observed in metalloproteins in general.  The
              mechanism to be tested includes:  deprotonation of substrate; involvement of
              the cross-linked tyrosine or lysine in catalysis; and facilitation of electron
              removal by c-hemes.  Specific goals are as follows.  (a) Cytochrome P460.  To
              purify the existing site directed mutant proteins K70A, K70R and K70Y and
              characterize their catalytic, optical-, EPR- and Raman-spectra and their redox
              potentials.  To work on the X-ray crystallographic structure will continue. (b)
               HAO.  To develop an expression system for the hao gene and make site-directed
              mutants. To identify by proteolysis and MALDI residue(s) which are derivatized
              by trinitromethane or which are modified in the native protein.  To complete
              the X-ray structure. (c)  Cytochrome c554.   To characterize the existing site
              directed mutant F156A.  (d)  Cytochrome c552.  To purify and characterize the
              existing v63 deletion site directed mutant and establish the structural basis
              for the HALS signal.  (e)  Cytochrome c Peroxidase. To complete analysis of the
              crystal structure and prepare site-directed mutants.
