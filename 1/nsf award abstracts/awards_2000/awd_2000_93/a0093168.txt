Abstract    :
              XML has become the prime standard for data exchange on the Web and is
              increasingly used to represent data currently residing in databases. With this
              comes the need for a full treatment of integrity constraints for XML such as
              key, foreign key, functional, inclusion and inverse constraints, which are
              commonly found in databases to convey an essential part of the semantics of the
              data. The goal of this project is to develop XML specifications with
              constraints, to advance understanding of consistency and implication of XML
              constraints, and to explore applications of constraints in XML data
              transformations including information preservation, constraint propagation and
              normalization of XML specifications. In pursuit of this goal, methods for
              specifying and reasoning about XML constraints are developed, and
              transformation techniques and tools in the XML context are implemented and
              evaluated. An important application of these tools and techniques involves the
              use of constraints in the specification of biomedical data and the conversion
              of such data to XML. The educational goal aims at the development of a database
              curriculum at Temple University that integrates data management for
              semistructured data, XML and traditional databases in a uniform framework of
              semantic specifications. An important component of this curriculum involves the
              research and implementation opportunities provided by the project. Results from
              the project are expected to yield insight into integrity constraints for
              hierarchically structured data, including but not limited to XML. They will
              also provide methods, techniques and tools to facilitate semantic
              specification, data integration and query optimization.
