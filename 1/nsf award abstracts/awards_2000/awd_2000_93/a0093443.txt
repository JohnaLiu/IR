Abstract    :
              Professor William Breckenridge of the University of Utah is supported by the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry program to perform experiments on the
              activation of C-H bonds in gaseous clusters containing metal centers.  This
              proposal seeks to discover mechanisms by which C-H bond breaking occurs in gas
              phase clusters mimicking two situations:  side-on interactions of metal
              electrons with C-H bonds as would occur in organometallic compounds, and C-H
              bond activation on the surfaces of metal oxides.  The clusters will be studied
              using various laser probes such as laser-induced fluorescence, and multiphoton
              ionization spectroscopy.  

The problem of structure and dynamics in simple
              metal-hydrocarbon systems is made quite relevant in this proposal by the
              comparison to real world problems in catalysis.  The breaking of C-H bonds is
              of great interest in a variety of important technological processes such as
              hydrocarbon cracking, catalysis, synthesis of chemicals from natural gas,
              hydrogenation and organic synthesis.
