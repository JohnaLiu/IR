Abstract    :
              
The research aspect of this CAREER proposal focuses on a novel
              and
fundamental approach for fabricating and engineering tunable band gap and
              lattice
constant multi-component semiconductor substrates for optoelectronic,
              photonic, high
speed electronic, spintronic, micro-electro-mechanical systems
              and photovoltaic
applications. The proposed substrate engineering technology
              is based upon several
advanced concepts recently developed in the areas of
              ternary and quaternary bulk crystal
growth from melts, thermodynamic modeling
              of multi-component alloys, and interfacial
defect generation by the principal
              investigator. As a part of this career award, a new
Substrate Engineering
              Reactor will be designed and installed for compatible
              multi-component
substrate growth and hetero-epitaxy. Multi-component
              engineered substrates
of III-V compounds and related device structures will be
              fabricated by employing the
new fundamental approach.
The integration of the
              proposed research with undergraduate and graduate
education at Rensselaer
              Polytechnic Institute will include: (a) development of new
introductory level
              interdisciplinary course for undergraduates in the area of
              compound
semiconductor materials and device structures with specific focus
              towards
microelectronics, optoelectronics, and spintronics, (b) development of
              a graduate level
course on emerging materials and high performance device
              technologies, (c) research
opportunities for at least two doctoral students
              and several undergraduate and master's
students in the areas of substrate
              engineering and device fabrication on multi-component
alloys with specific
              focus towards new device architectures. The introduction of the
above topics
              into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum is in synergy with
Rensselaer's
              educational plans and will enable and enhance student's exposure to
              rapidly
growing modern and future semiconductor technologies.
