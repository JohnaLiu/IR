Abstract    :
              Many important non-numeric applications are data intensive; hence, they will
              experience performance degradations as the gap between future processor and
              memory speeds widen.  Unlike scientific workloads, non-numeric applications
              perform unstructured computations that exhibit low control-flow and address
              stream predictability, and low instruction and thread-level parallelism.  These
              attributes limit the effectiveness of existing techniques for improving memory
              performance on non-numeric applications.

This CAREER award addresses the
              memory gap problem for non-numeric applications through an integrated research
              and education agenda.  In research, several novel latency tolerance techniques
              will be developed to target unstructured computations.  First, techniques for
              guiding prefetch instrumentation through runtime profile information will be
              studies to address unpredictable program behavior.  Second, pointer prefetching
              techniques that aggressively schedule serialized memory operations will be
              developed to expose memory parallelism in pointer-intensive computations. 
              Finally, "code-space" prefetch scheduling techniques will be investigated to
              enable prefetching along the multiple paths of execution commonly found in
              unstructured computations.  In education, the topics and tools developed
              through research will be integrated into a curriculum that emphasized a
              "learn-by-doing" philosophy.  In addition, undergraduate research programs and
              graduate student workshops will be created.  Together, these education
              activities will produce students with a strong background in experimental
              systems.
