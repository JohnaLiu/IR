Abstract    :
              
The goal of the proposed research is to develop and use nonlinear optical
              techniques to study solid-liquid catalytic reactions important for fine
              chemical synthesis.  The proposed research is a central part of an effort to
              study surface chemistry of heterogeneous fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals
              catalysis with modern in-situ spectroscopic techniques.  The two approaches
              that will be used are sum frequency spectroscopy (SFS) and second harmonic
              generation (SHG).  Both techniques are purely surface-selective, in that only
              the catalyst surface and the molecules adsorbed on it are detected.  Two
              different types of experiments are planned.  The first involves the study of
              model supported metal catalysts by total internal reflection (TIR) SFS and SHG.
               The second type of experiment will attempt to extend SHG (and eventually SFS)
              studies to catalyst particles in solution.  Both methods will constitute the
              first application of nonlinear optical techniques to solid-liquid catalytic
              systems.  Surface-enhanced Raman and infrared spectroscopic measurements will
              provide additional information regarding the state of catalyst surfaces. 
              Parallel reaction rate measurements will be made in order to correlate surface
              in interface properties with catalytic rates and selectivity, and reaction
              mechanisms will be proposed.  Fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals represent a
              rapidly expanding sector of the chemical industry.  Heterogeneous catalysis
              shows promise for facilitating a smooth transition to more environmentally
              benign processing.
