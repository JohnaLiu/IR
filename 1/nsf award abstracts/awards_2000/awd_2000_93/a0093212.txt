Mathias Frisch
Philosophy and Classical
              Electrodynamics


This proposal is to allow Frisch to complete a book
              entitled Philosophy and Classical Electrodynamics.  He investigates several
              philosophical issues arising in classical electrodynamics, a theory that to
              date has received relatively little attention from philosophers of science.
              Frisch argues that philosophers unjustifiably have taken the theory to be
              conceptually unproblematic and that an in-depth philosophical investigation of
              classical electrodynamics can shed new light on a number of important general
              problems in the philosophy of science, such as that of the role of laws,
              symmetries, and models in scientific theorizing; the question of the role of a
              theory's domain; and the problem of causation. Frisch proposes to complete a
              manuscript of the book, which brings together several relatively independent
              philosophical investigations.  The common philosophical thread in the book is
              Frisch's claim that most traditional accounts of scientific theories have 
              overemphasized the role of laws in scientific theorizing. According to
              traditional accounts there is a simple mapping function from the mathematical
              models of a theory's laws onto the phenomena and the scientists' and
              philosophers' interpretive work is exhausted by identifying this mapping
              function and describing the possible worlds that with its help can be
              constructed from the laws' mathematical models. By contrast, Frisch argues that
              the representational content of a theory ought to be located in 'low-level'
              representational models, which need not in general satisfy the theory's laws
              and which are embedded into a much richer interpretive framework than
              traditional accounts permit.
