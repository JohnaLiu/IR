This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              in applied mathematics involves Lynne Billard at the University of Georgia and
              Edwin Diday of the University of Paris, Dauphine, and the Institute for
              Research in Informatics and Applied Mathematics (INRIA) at Rocquencourt,
              France.  The investigators will focus on developing methodologies for analyzing
              symbolic data. The approach involves scientific computing in conjunction with
              numerical and statistical analysis concepts. This project addresses the twin
              goals of developing methodologies for symbolic data analysis, extending it to
              more general and complex data, and the reviewing of current methods for areas
              that need further research.  Mathematical foundation and robustness of these
              methods will also be studied.  Symbolic data are useful for summarizing large
              data sets to render them manageable for analysis.  Few methods currently exist
              to analyze symbolic data and will be needed as the demand for large scientific
              data sets increases and symbolic data become more prevalent. 

This award
              represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French National
              Institute for Research in Informatics and Applied Mathematics (INRIA).  NSF
              will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and
              graduate student.  INRIA will support the visits of French researchers to the
              United States. The project takes advantage of the French investigator's
              computational expertise. He has developed the basic concepts involved in
              symbolic data.  This is complemented by US expertise in statistics and
              statistical analysis.
