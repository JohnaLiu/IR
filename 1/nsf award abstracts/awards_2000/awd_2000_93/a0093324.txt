Abstract    :
              This research investigates the creation and use of configurable adaptable
              components as Intellectual Property (IP).  The research proposes novel
              algorithms for: (1) choosing an optimal configurable component composed of one
              or more configurable fabrics, and for (2) synthesizing hardware-independent run
              time managers.  The algorithms are explored in the context of a minimal
              adaptive component that provides on-demand services to clients (algorithms). 
              This minimal component is comprised of hardware synthesized from different
              configurable fabrics, and a run time manager.  The manager provides on-demand
              services, such as security checks, buffering, configuration caching, and an API
              that facilitates utilizing and programming the configurable component.
