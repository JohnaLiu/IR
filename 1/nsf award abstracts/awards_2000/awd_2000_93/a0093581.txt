Abstract    :
              The goal is a new computational method for the design of controllers for hybrid
              robotic systems. The method will be  based on algorithms for extracting
              piecewise-linear approximations of nonlinear hybrid systems, and will be
              applied to two problems in robotics: 1) stability of limit cycles for hybrid
              systems; and 2) passivity analysis of hybrid systems. Stability criteria that
              exploit concepts of partial order and multiple Lyapunov functions will be
              adapted to piecewise-linear systems, and used with the proposed computational
              method to characterize passivity of hybrid systems. On the education side, the
              PI will develop a robotics curriculum that emphasizes close interaction between
              engineering and computer science; hybrid robotic systems will be used as
              motivating examples. The curriculum will underline the importance of
              interdisciplinary education for solving new technological challenges.
