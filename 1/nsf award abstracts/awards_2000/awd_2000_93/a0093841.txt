              ABSTRACT CMS0094022 "Knowledge Discovery in Databases and Data Mining as New
              tools to Support Research and Educational Advances in Modern Construction
              Management " PI: Lucio Soibelman, University of Illinois at

The construction industry is seeing an explosive growth in
              its capabilities to both generate and collect data. Advances in scientific data
              collection, the introduction of bar codes for almost all-commercial products,
              new sensor technologies, wireless computing, and new laser scanning
              technologies, have generated a flood of data. These advances coupled with
              advances in data storage technology, such as faster, higher capacity, and
              cheaper storage devices, better database management systems, and data
              warehousing technology, have increased the availability of computerized
              construction data. However, in most cases, these data are used only for
              communication purposes and stored in a file or a database without being
              analyzed. This project intends to study this increasing amount of available
              data by applying data mining and knowledge discovery in databases. Knowledge
              discovery in databases and data mining are technologies that combine techniques
              from machine learning, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition,
              statistics, databases and visualization to automatically extract concepts,
              concepts interrelationships, and patterns of interest from large databases.
              
The objectives of this CAREER program are to: 1) Generate improved methods to
              obtain novel knowledge from large construction databases developing
              model-building templates and wizards to guide novice construction knowledge
              model builders through the process of creating models based on their own data;
              2) Improve access to past construction management experience and knowledge by
              practitioners and students; 3) Use active learning techniques to improve
              education of students at all levels by developing an educational simulation
              game with the knowledge generated during this research; and 4) Teach civil and
              environmental engineering graduate students the process of knowledge generation
              through the application and development of data mining, machine learning and
              artificial intelligence tools.
Given the importance of the construction
              industry in the U.S economy and the large amount of money wasted in litigation
              due to project delays, impractical budgets, and projects that neither satisfy
              quality requirements nor meet performance expectations, improved management
              tools are critically needed. This research promises to result in valuable
              management tools for improving project planning and control, which, if applied
              to large-scale infrastructure projects, may result in substantial cost savings
              nationwide. These research benefits can be extended to all sub-fields of
              construction management
