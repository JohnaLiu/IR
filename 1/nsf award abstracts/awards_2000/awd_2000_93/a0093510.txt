This award to the Society for the
              Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) enables the
              organization to recruit approximately 100 Latino and Native American
              undergraduate students to participate in the 2000 SACNAS National Conference. 
              This meeting will be held in Atlanta, Oct. 12-15, 2000.  At the conference the
              students will present research results in the Undergraduate and Graduate
              Student Poster Session.  The students will also participate in a number of
              workshops and seminars to prepare them for the graduate school application
              process.  To complement those activities, a number of graduate school
              representatives will be available to the students in an exhibit hall.  These
              representatives will be talking to the students about their graduate programs
              and collecting their resumes.  

Historically, the SACNAS National
              Conferences have focused on students from chemistry, biology, and
              health-related disciplines.  In recent years SACNAS has been expanding its
              scope to include engineering as well as other science-related fields.  Thus,
              the SACNAS program is beginning to reflect the funding profile of NSF.  This
              renewal award provides support to continue that broadening process.  Short-term
              goals of this activity include an increase in the number of SACNAS conference
              attendees with interests in the non-biomedical sciences and engineering.  In
              the longer term, increases in Latinos and Native Americans in NSF-relevant
              science and engineering activities are expected.

This award is supported
              jointly by the Directorates for Engineering; Social, Behavioral, and Economic
              Sciences; and Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
