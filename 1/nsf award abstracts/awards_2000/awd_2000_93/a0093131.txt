Abstract    :
              Information theory is the science of quantifying, encoding, and
extracting
              information.  The research proposed in this career
development plan consists
              of work designed to strengthen the
theoretical foundations and empirical
              applicability of computational
learning through the development of a rigorous,
              information-theoretic
framework for investigating this discipline. 
              Specifically, an
information-theoretic framework, based on communication
              theory, is
proposed for investigating the probably approximately correct
              (PAC)
model of machine learning.  This framework is shown to be robust
              and
extensible; new learning algorithms, general measures of performance,
and
              analysis techniques are all proposed and demonstrated.

In addition to
              providing a means for strengthening the theoretical
foundations of
              computational learning, this framework also provides a
mechanism for
              developing and rigorously analyzing new learning
algorithms.  New algorithms
              for hypothesis boosting, document
classification, document filtering, and
              meta-search are all proposed.
The proposed applications work has both
              theoretical and experimental
components: all new algorithms are to be
              analyzed, implemented and
tested using benchmark data.

Teaching and
              education are an integral part of this career development
plan.  Both graduate
              and undergraduate students are introduced to
topical research, both
              theoretical and applied, through the projects
proposed. New courses on
              learning and information retrieval,
accessible to both graduate and
              undergraduate students, are also
proposed.
