Abstract    :
              The long-term goal of my integrated research and educational
plan is to develop
              interactive virtual environment sys-tems
supporting realistic aural/visual
              simulation of large 3D
models containing multiple interacting
              users.

Research Plan

The main objective of the proposed research project
              is to
develop efficient algorithms for simulating the propagation
of light
              and sound waves through a virtual environment by
scattering at surfaces of a
              3D model. This research problem
is central to providing a realistic experience
              in an
immersive virtual environment, as its solution enables
global
              illumination and sound spatialization. It is also
significant for several
              other applications, including motion
planning, inverse modeling, scene
              capture, heat transfer,
radio power prediction, fire propagation, and
              traffic
analysis, which are all important in fields beyond immersive
virtual
              environments.

For simulations of both lighting and acoustics,
              the
fundamental problem is to compute a solution to an integral
equation
              expressing the wave field at every point in terms
of the wave field on
              surrounding surfaces. The main
difficulty is that the wave field has
              discontinuities due to
occlusions, caustics, and specular highlights, which
              induce
large variations over small portions of the integration
domain (i.e.
              surfaces or directions). Previous integration
methods based on radiosity and
              Monte Carlo path tracing are
generally not practical for typical virtual
              environments.

I plan to investigate a hybrid beam tracing and path
              tracing
approach. The general strategy is to trace beams that
partition the
              space of rays into topologically distinct
bundles corresponding to different
              sequences of scattering
events at surfaces of the 3D scene
              (reverberation
sequences), and then use them to guide sampling in
              an
interactive path tracing algorithm. The motivation for this
approach is
              that attributes of a relatively small number of
beams traced during the first
              phase can provide useful
information about the wave field that can be used to
              guide
and accelerate evaluation of samples during the second
phase. This
              approach enables efficient methods for: 1)
enumeration of reverberation
              sequences, 2) decomposition of
integration domain, 3) conservative
              approximation, 4)
spatial coherence in ray intersections, 5) sampling
              of
reverberation sequences, 6) progressive refinement, and 7)
off-line
              precomputation. The challenge is to develop methods
that trace beams through
              3D models quickly and reap the
benefits of the traced beams in useful
              applications.

My research plan is to investigate hybrid beam tracing
              and
path tracing approaches to solve classical problems for
virtual
              environments. The new research contributions will be
made at four levels:
              theory, algorithms, applications, and
experiments. First, I plan to
              investigate new theory for
modeling wave propagation as a discrete set of
              reverber-
ation paths incorporating multiple scattering effects
including
              diffractions. Second, I plan to develop new
algorithms that efficiently find
              significant reverberation
paths with general types of scattering in general 3D
              models.
Third, I plan to investigate new applications where the
proposed
              approach for computing reverberation paths can be
used to solve classical
              problems. Finally, I plan to perform
experiments to evaluate the results of
              computed simulations
both quantitatively and qualitatively in comparison
              to
measured wave fields. The overall outcome of this research
will be a
              computational framework and a suite of methods for
computing general
              reverberation paths in general 3D models
and evaluating them in interactive
              applications.

Throughout this project, I plan to investigate the
              synergies
between sound and light and to apply the lessons learned
from one
              wave phenomenon to the other. Based on historical
precedent, I believe that it
              will be possible to develop
better simulations of virtual environments by
              studying both
sound and light together.

Educational Plan

The objectives
              of my educational plan are to teach students
and to develop new methods for
              education. In particular, one
special goal of mine is to enable the use of
              interactive
virtual environment systems in the educational process. I
plan to
              investigate this novel media for education by
designing new interdisciplinary
              courses that will allow
students and teachers from widely varying backgrounds
              to
learn about and experiment with virtual environment systems.
I also plan
              to develop new educational materials (textbook,
course notes, software tools,
              and 3D models), to mentor
students (graduate, undergraduate, and K-12), and to
              develop
outreach programs for disadvantaged people (mentoring
              under-
privileged students and deploying
              handicap-assisting
applications).

By both developing interactive virtual
              environment systems
for research, and investigating their use for teaching,
              my
research and educational activities are uniquely integrated.
