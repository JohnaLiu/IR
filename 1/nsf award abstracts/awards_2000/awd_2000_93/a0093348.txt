Abstract    :
              This CAREER computational geometry project will conduct
research in several
              areas: 

- kinetic data structures for collision detection,  

- geometric
              range searching data structures for both static
and moving points, 

-
              Delauney and other triangulations for well-spread point
sets, and 

-
              intersection and convex decomposition of smooth polyhedra.
