Abstract    :
              There is a tremendous market for tetherless and ubiquitous network
access, and
              a great demand for nomadic computation and
communication. A major component of
              such a system is a high speed
robust wireless local area network (WLAN) that
              provides services for a
limited geographical area. This limited geographical
              area enables a
large density of access points as well as high power
              tranmissions and
opens up the possibility of high rate robust multimedia
              communications
comparable to wired systems. Even though the bandwidth is
              still
scarce, the spatial dimension can now be exploited: The size of
typical
              WLAN devices, such as laptops and hand-held computers, enable
proper spacing
              of multiple antennas to provide diversity and coding
gains.

This research
              is aimed at a complete system design for multiple
antenna methods in the WLAN
              environment including coding, modulation,
channel estimation and power control
              strategies specifically tailored
for the slow fading environment of a WLAN
              channel. In particular,
high-rate multiple antenna coded modulation techniques
              and multiple
transmit antenna joint source and channel coding strategies
              are
developed. The issue of channel estimation along with feedback
              is
investigated and power control based on limited feedback is adressed.
A
              general approach to multiple transmit antenna methods is explored by
providing
              a theoretical foundation for spatially separated antennas in
WLAN
              environments. 

The education plan is closely aligned with the research work
              and
emphasises the use of internet and computers in education by making
use
              of Polytechnic University's newly installed WLAN system on
campus. Curriculum
              development addresses specific needs of
Polytechnic's professional masters
              program and is based on an
integrated, end-to-end approach to communication
              systems.
