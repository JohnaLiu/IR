This grant supports the acquisition of a frequency
              quintupled (193 nm wavelength) deep ultraviolet (DUV) laser to be interfaced
              with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers (both a quadrupole and a
              multicollector) in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences (EAPS) at
              Harvard University.  The laser ablation system will allow continued studies
              requiring in situ and spatially resolved isotopic analysis of geological and
              extraterrestrial materials.  The laser system will support research by several
              faculty members at Harvard including Stein Jacobsen (crust-mantle geochemistry
              and cosmochemistry), Dan Schrag (marine chemistry and paleoceanography), Paul
              Hoffman (Neoproterozoic tectonics and climate) and Heinrich Holland (evolution
              of Earth's early atmosphere) as well as their graduate students and postdocs.
