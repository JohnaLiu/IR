Abstract    :
              This project extends current interests of the P.I. in new directions, in both
              research and education. The project aims at the development of wavelet methods
              as well as at their use in interdisciplinary research efforts. Wavelets, the
              P.I.'s Ph.D. thesis subject, have become increasingly popular in many
              scientific fields since the discovery of orthonormal wavelet bases
              by
Daubechies and Mallat in 1989. The work that the P.I. intends to do over
              the next five years addresses the application of wavelet methods in four
              different but interrelated areas:
i) nonparametric density estimation;
ii)
              time series;
iii) dimension reduction in curve regression, and
iv)
              interdisciplinary research in biology.
Specific contributions include the
              development of nonparametric wavelet-based hypothesis tests; the wavelet
              estimation of parameters of random processes, with emphasis on long-memory; 
              Bayesian wavelet component selection techniques and, finally, applications of
              wavelet
methods in the analysis of proteins and genomes.

In addition to the
              research component, the P.I. will develop a course on wavelet methods. Theory
              will be interlaced with applications in many areas of practical interest and
              lectures integrated with computer demonstrations. The course will be at the
              advanced graduate level, for statistics
and non-statistics majors. The goal
              will be to train students that may subsequently do their dissertation work on
              wavelets. The course will also produce students capable of bringing
wavelet
              methods in research fields other than statistics.
