Abstract    :
              This integrated research and education proposal describes a new
server-centric
              approach to computing based on the premise that
advances in network speed and
              ubiquity have created the conditions in
which a computer utility can be used
              to deliver computational services
over the Internet to end users. The computer
              utility model described
is one in which users' entire computing environment,
              including all
applications, data, and the window system, reside
              on
professionally-managed servers. Users can then access their
              computing
environments from any Internet-enabled client device.  The
              proposed
research will focus on three areas: (1) remote display technologies
              to
enable remote graphical access to applications without requiring
              any
application modifications, (2) server resource management mechanisms
to
              deliver guaranteed levels of performance to large numbers of
interactive
              users, and (3) server cluster resource management that
will effectively load
              balance, allocate, and reliably provide
computing resources from a cluster of
              servers to users and groups of
users.  The proposal also describes how the
              research will be applied
and integrated with curriculum development efforts to
              develop an IT
distance learning education laboratory for teaching systems
              courses,
particularly operating systems.
