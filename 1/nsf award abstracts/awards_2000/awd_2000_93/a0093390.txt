Abstract    :
              Complex geometry becomes increasingly common in applications
arising in diverse
              areas. Plastic surgeons use computer
models to plan and perform operations.
              Mechanical engineers
virtually assemble and test cars and planes.
              Animators
create complex characters and effects indistinguishable
              from
reality. Geometric modeling has found its way into art
conservation: it
              is now feasible to create computer models
of sculptures capturing the most
              subtle of details.
Increasing complexity of geometric data calls for
              new
efficient representations and algorithms. The goal of our
long-term
              research plan is to study representations of
complex geometric data, surfaces
              in particular. We plan to
launch a broad and fundamental program to explore
              three
types of representations: piecewise-smooth surfaces,
multiscale
              surfaces and combined volume-surface
representations. Our approach to
              designing complex surface
representations is based on the concept of
              subdivision, a
powerful technique for modeling smooth surfaces.
              Subdivision
algorithms, while being more flexible and general, retain
              a
number of useful properties of splines. Most importantly,
the surfaces
              generated by these algorithms have a natural
hierarchical structure and are
              computed using efficient
local rules; subdivision algorithms can be easily
              extended
to represent multiscale data. The general goal of our
research is to
              design representations supporting efficient
algorithms for construction,
              rendering, manipulation,
processing, transmission and storage of surface data.
              We
will explore in close coordination both theoretical
properties of these
              representations (regularity, convergence
rates, fairness, stability) and their
              practical
applications. The specific goal of the proposed project is
to
              generalize to surfaces the signal processing tools that
were designed and are
              extensively used for images. The
research program is integrated with the
              education plan,
which has three main goals: (1) prepare graduate students
for
              research in computer graphics and related areas, (2)
incorporate the latest
              advances in research into curriculum
at all levels, including undergraduate,
              and engage motivated
undergraduate students in research (3) transfer
              knowledge
about latest research advances to professionals in the
industry.
