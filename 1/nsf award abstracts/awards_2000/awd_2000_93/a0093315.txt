Abstract    :
              Ensuring that high assurance systems meet their reliability requirements 
prior
              to deployment is essential.  The research focuses on combining the 
strengths
              of formal verification methods and program testing.  The cornerstone 
of this
              unified, quantitative software reliability assessment framework is 
the use of
              Bayesian inference. Subjective probabilities of software failures 
are
              obtained through formal or informal verification.  Statistical testing 
can
              either corroborate that the required reliability level is met, or it
              
indicates that the subjectively established failure probabilities are not
              
realistic, prompting the need for rework and improvement.  Several
              
combinations of verification techniques and statistical testing are 
based
              on program structure.  Research objectives include the identification 
of
              program designs, which make software reliability assessment feasible, 
and
              demonstration of their suitability for high assurance applications.
              

Educational activities accompanying the research theme include research
              
experience for undergraduate and graduate students, and curriculum
              
development. The goal of educational activities is to expose students 
to
              the development and assurance of complex systems through their 
participation
              in experiments and case studies.  Participating students 
form
              multidisciplinary teams including computer science, computer 
engineering and
              electrical engineering majors.
