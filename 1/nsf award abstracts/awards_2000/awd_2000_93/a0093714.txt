Abstract    :
              Abstact:
In this career plan we propose to use computational approaches
              that
integrate atomistic simulation tools with mesoscale methodologies
              to
tackle problems relevant to nanotechnology. The proposed
work on modeling
              of interactions and dynamics of
steps on crystal surfaces and
              dislocation-obstacle interaction
in semiconductor heterostructures will
              provide guidance 
to experimental work in the areas of nanostructure
              
fabrication on vicinal surfaces, stress measurements in
nanoscale structures
              and growth of relaxed epitaxial semiconductor
thin films.
The educational
              part of the career plan aims at
developing curricula that fosters transfer of
              information
among disciplines. Specifically, we propose to 
provide
              opportunities for undergraduate research projects
in nanoscience and to
              develop senior-level/graduate courses
that focus on modeling of mechanical
              phenomena on
nanoscales. The courses will incorporate methods and models
              of
modern statistical mechanics with emphasis on
 their application to defect
              mechanics in nanostructures.
