Abstract    :
              This proposal was submitted in response to the CAREER Program Announcement and
              contained both scientific and educational goals.

The ultimate scientific
              goals of this proposed study are to understand how physical and biological
              processes (bioturbation) interact to produce indificual sedimentar units and
              the sedimentary record in general.  The project will collect a wide variety of
              environmental data at four (4) selected sites in the Gulf of Mexico, and
              samples to examine the sedimentary record, physical processes of sedimentation,
              and bioturbation.  The four (4) sites vary significantly to terms of rates of
              deposition and rates of bioturbation.  Finally, the results will be compared
              with quantitative forward models that attempt to quantify the effects of
              physical and biological variables, and with mesocosm laboratory experiments in
              which benthic fauna interact with sediment in the lab.

The educational
              aspects of the proposal included:  undergraduate outreach to students at
              regional HBCU's curse development, student participation in proposed research
              efforts, and adopting the models developed for use as teaching aids.
