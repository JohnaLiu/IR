This theoretical project is comprised of several related
              topics.  One of them is density functional theory of both long-range and
              short-range interaction between microscopic and mesoscopic bodies.  Another
              looks at a theory of electronic dissipation, non-adiabatic charge transfer and
              potentials and rates for atoms and molecular species moving and reacting at a
              solid surface. A third component is the theory of transport in quantum dots
              using techniques previously developed for non-adiabatic charge transfer.  This
              work is related to the properties of metals and insulators at a surface.  It
              explores the new physical phenomena which are seen as an electron, an atom, or
              a molecular species moves near a surface.  These include very subtle,
              long-range and technologically important questions of forces between small
              bodies and between a small grain and a surface.  They include complex questions
              of charge transfer, dissipation and energy transfer, when do they happen and
              how.  Finally there are attempts to understand transport in single electron
              transistors, consisting of very small artificial structures embedded in
              metallic layers on semiconductor surfaces.

This is a theoretical project
              comprised of a number of related topics including ones dealing with the
              interactions of small objects (electrons, atoms, molecules) with larger ones
              (surfaces and quantum dots).  Included are fundamental issues related to
              nanoscale phenomena and nanodevices.
