A unique high-resolution vacuum
              ultraviolet facility at the Chemical Dynamics Beamline of the Advanced Light
              Source synchrotron machine would be used to measure absolute cross sections for
              charge transfer reactions of O with molecular ions that are of great importance
              to the modeling of ion-molecular reactions in the thermospheres of the Earth,
              Venus, and Mars.  Single state selection techniques would be employed to
              measure these cross sections for individual rovibronic states of these ions. 
              The proposed work is challenging but of great importance to the development of
              aeronomical models of planetary atmospheres and ionospheres.
