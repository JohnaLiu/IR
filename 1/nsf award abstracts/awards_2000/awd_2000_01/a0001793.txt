Abstract    :
              The proposed PESCA program will amplify the reach of existing IAI projects and
              programs: the Initial Science Program (ISP) and the Collaborative Research
              Network (CRN).  PESCA  will involve countries now not adequately involved in
              IAI program/project activities by involving participating scientists from these
              countries as full partners in the projects, participating as CoPIs.

As
              determined by the IAI's merit based peer review system, the following potential
