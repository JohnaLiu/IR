Abstract    :
                                                                                              
                                                                                             
                               The ultimate goal of the project proposed here is the delivery
              of a biology curriculum directed towards students in their roles as laypersons.
               It will  integrate domain content with a consideration of the social and
              personal issues that arise in the course of learning about evolution.  Students
              will investigate empirical controversies that impact everyday life and related
              ethical dilemmas.  They will learn to go beyond media accounts to determine
              what information they need to make a sound decision, how to collect this
              information, and how to use it to make decisions and communicate effectively. 
              Assessments will allow us to examine basic cognitive and social processes that
              underlie their reasoning, as well as determine the practical effectiveness of
              the curriculum.
