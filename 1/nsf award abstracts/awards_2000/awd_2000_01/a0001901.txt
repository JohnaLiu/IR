This study will investigate the role of women's bargaining
              power (intra-household power dynamics) in shaping access to resources and
              children's health in Tanzania. The researcher will test two competing
              hypotheses concerning the factors that influence women's marital bargaining
              power in a rural community.  The study is based on previous research that
              argues that where women have greater bargaining power (and thus access to
              resources), child health improves. Using behavioral ecology theory, the
              research will examine how women's bargaining power shapes maternal work
              efforts, paternal contributions to the household, and ultimately child health.
              Methods include a village survey, demographic analysis, time allocation
              studies, and structured interviews with samples of the population. This study
              contributes to debates in economics and anthropology concerning how individuals
              in households, particularly less powerful members such as women and children,
              achieve and utilize bargaining power to access resources (and thus health).
