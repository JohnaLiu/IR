Abstract    :
              This research project explores the relationship among methamphetamine use and
              distribution, and incidents of interpersonal violence. The project involves 200
              respondents in total, with six subsamples of methamphetamine users and sellers.
               The specific aims of the project are to: gather data on the contexts and
              circumstances of events where methamphetamine users and seller use violence; 
              explore the pharmacological relationship between methamphetamine use and
              violent behavior;  probe the association between methamphetamine distribution
              and violence; determine more about the relationship between methamphetamine use
              and domestic violence; and develop perspectives on the role the economic,
              cultural, and social milieu play in the decisions by respondents to participate
              in violence.

Although an important focus of the work is to explore how
              methamphetamine users and sellers interpret themselves, others, and the
              criminal situations they experience, the PIs will also use the data to explore,
              quantitatively, patterns of offending.  Using the life event histories,
              estimates of offenders' criminal involvement will be developed, length of
              criminal careers will be estimated by offense type and other dimensions of
              criminal involvement.
