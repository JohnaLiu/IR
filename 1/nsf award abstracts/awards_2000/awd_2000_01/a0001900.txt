Abstract    :
              0001900  Logan  The objective of this research is to elucidate the physiology of
              perchlorate reducing microorganisms (PRMs).  Perchlorate has been detected in
              ground waters and it endangers the drinking water supply of more than twelve
              million people.  Perchlorate can be used as an electron acceptor by many newly
              isolated strains of bacteria.  Evidence suggests that in the last step of
              perchlorate reduction, a chlorite dismutase produces molecular oxygen.  This is
              an interesting biological development because oxygen is a preferred electron
              acceptor.  Under fully aerobic conditions, even capable bacteria do not reduce
              perchlorate.  Nitrates can also interfere with perchlorate reduction.  Using
              respiratory inhibitors, the researchers will probe the transfer of electrons
              along the respiratory chain in PRMs in order to determine how perchlorate and
              chlorate are used for cell respiration.  Through the use of other chemicals,
              such as chloramphenicol to inhibit protein synthesis,  it will be determined
              whether different pathways are inducible or constitutive and what conditions
              are necessary to maintain perchlorate-reducing conditions in bacterial
              cultures.  This research will provide information necessary for the development
              of drinking water, wastewater and in-situ treatment systems to biologically
              remove perchlorate.***
