T. Gasparik, M. J. Drake, J. B. Parise: Collaborative Research of
              the
Origin of Inclusions in Diamonds From the Deep Mantle

In this CSEDI
              collaborative research project, we plan to continue our
experimental
              investigation of the origin of inclusions in diamonds from the
deep mantle
              using the minor and trace element contents of the inclusions.
Observed element
              contents will be matched in high-pressure experiments on
phase relations and
              element partitioning in those assemblages which include
phases found as
              inclusions in diamonds. We will complete our ongoing
studies of the origin of
              inclusions with CaSiO3 and (Mg,Fe)O compositions,
and then extend the
              investigation to the origin of majoritic garnet
inclusions. The minor and
              trace element contents to be matched by
experiments are available for all
              three kinds of inclusions. Partitioning
of these elements among phases in
              various assemblages, which include
analogues of the selected inclusions and
              other phases observed as
inclusions, is determined over a range of
              experimental pressures,
temperatures and compositions, until a close match is
              found between the
minor and trace element contents of the inclusions and of
              the analogue
phases. The compositions of the coexisting phases then provide
              information
about the original assemblage, from which the inclusion came, and
              thus
constrain the mineral and chemical composition of the source region and
              the
P-T conditions of origin.
