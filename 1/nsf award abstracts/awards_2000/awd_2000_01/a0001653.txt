Abstract    :
              ATM-0001653

The PI proposes to develop a concept that will improve the
              possibility of observing the impact of space weather on the
              magnetosphere-ionosphere system, and that will address fundamental physical
              processes related to space weather phenomena.  This will be done by focusing
              operations of sensitive ground based equipment to occur during potentially
              disruptive space weather conditions.  By analyzing these observations in
              conjunction with spacecraft observations, SRI can develop an improved
              understanding of the coupling between the solar wind and magnetosphere and
              between the magnetosphere and ionosphere (generally termed space weather
              "geoeffectiveness").  Thus, the overall objective of the proposal is to observe
              and analyze space weather geoeffectiveness by implementing an operational phase
              and a basic research phase to the program.  The operational phase of the
              program is designed to provide a space weather alert system that notifies
              observers of solar and space conditions during times of activity so that
              appropriate planning of ground-based operations can be established.  The
              development and implementation of such an alert protocol for the
              incoherent-scatter radar community was established under past NSWP funding. 
              The basic research phase of the program is designed to study the
              geoeffectiveness of the space weather event by analyzing data in the form of
              substorms, storms, and convection bays. As the acquired data sets will benefit
              all of these topics, it is anticipated that the results will contribute to a
              number of space weather research programs, present and future.
