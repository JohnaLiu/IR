As the economy of India has grown and developed, dowries
              have increased, weddings have become more lavish, and groups that did not
              previously pay dowry have adopted the practice. Using techniques from human
              behavioral ecology and microeconomic theory, this project will investigate the
              causes of dowry inflation in Bangalore, South India. It will specifically test
              a number of hypotheses concerning the relationships between economic factors,
              fertility patterns, parental investment, and marriage systems. Survey data on
              these variables will be collected from 200 women in four endogamous communities
              in Bangalore. These communities have different population profiles regarding
              socioeconomic status, education, and degree of modernity. This will be
              supplemented with structured interviews on the social and economic history of
              each community, and the marriage arrangement and negotiation process. This
              project will contribute to theory in human behavioral ecology, and to our
              understanding of the factors shaping marriage practices cross-culturally.
