Abstract    :
              The objective of the study is to understand the basic and critical input
              parameter for the mechanics of subduction zone decollements, the quantitative
              effect of smectite input. The PI will carry out a study of the DSDP/ODP
              drilling samples to determine their clay mineralogy and how it influences
              seismic behavior and slip stability. The focus will be on samples from the
              Cascadia margin, but the results will be compared to and relevant to other
              seismogenic zones as well.
