Schoenbach

This is a one-year renewal to NSF award INT-9726752 to
              support Dr. Karl Schoenbach and a postdoctoral student to collaborate with
              Klaus Frank of the Physics Departent at the Friedrich Alexander University in
              Erlangen.  The collaboration will study two topics: the physics of multiple,
              parallel discharges in the steady-state phase, and the discharge ignition
              process.  These studies have application to the development of excimer light
              sources in direct-current (DC), low-voltage, flat-panel lamps.  Experimental
              and modeling studies on DC discharges will be combined with ignition-phase
              studies at Erlangen to accelerate research in the area of flat-panel excimer
              lamps, which provide quasi-monochromatic light sources with a wide range of
              applications.  Overall, the combined effort will provide a better understanding
              of the physics of hollow-cathode discharge arrays, provide information on the
              electric breakdown in single hollow-cathode discharges and discharge arrays,
              and determine the effect of electrode materials and dielectrics on the
              performance of the microhollow cathode discharges.
