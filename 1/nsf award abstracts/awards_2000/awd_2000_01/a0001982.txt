Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Sensory Systems and
              is entitled "Habitat Light and the Evolution of Visual-Signal Design".  Signal
              diversity in animals may be explained by selection pressures for particular
              signals and sensory systems based on optimal transmission and detection
              efficiency, as described by the sensory drive hypothesis (SDH).  The SDH may
              play an important role in genetic isolation of populations and, in turn,
              speciation.  This research examines six allopatric (i.e. occurring in different
              locations) populations of the lizard Anolis cristatellus found in two distinct
              habitat types.  Habitat light, visual-system response, and signal design are
              examined.  This study provides a greater understanding of the role of sensory
              drive in the generation of signal diversity and its potential role in the
              formation of new species.
