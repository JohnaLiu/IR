SGER: A pre-extirpation study of the role of
              stream-dwelling frogs

Scientists have documented that ~50% of the total frog
              population has disappeared from three upland sites in Costa Rica and Panama,
              and that extirpated species are comprised almost exclusively of stream-dwelling
              frogs. Evidence indicates a north-to-south 'wave of extinction' typical of
              disease epidemics. There is unanimous agreement among scientists that
              stream-dwelling frog populations in western Panama are in imminent danger of
              extirpation. Loss of frog populations is expected to affect both terrestrial
              and aquatic environments, with impacts on food webs and biogeochemical cycles.
              We presently have little quantitative knowledge about the roles of
              stream-dwelling frogs in these ecosystems. The investigators in this project
              will assess the roles of stream-dwelling frogs in Panama at sites which are
              expected to be dramatically altered within the upcoming years by the
              extirpation of frog populations.
