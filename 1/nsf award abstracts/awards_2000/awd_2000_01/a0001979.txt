Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Eukaryotic Genetics
              and is entitled "Analysis of the Role of Bulk Chromatin Proteins in Regulating
              Meiotic Recombination in the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae".    This research
              investigates the role of general chromatin configuration in regulating
              crossover recombination.  In particular, the functions of bulk chromatin
              proteins Bdf1, Hho1, Dot1, and Chd1 in meiosis in yeast S. cerevisiae are being
              examined via two independent approaches:  1. Various events of meiosis are
              analyzed in cells whose genes encoding these proteins have been deleted, and 2.
              Proteins that display significant meiotic function are characterized in
              wild-type cells at different stages of meiosis.  Also, chromosomal localization
              of relevant proteins are being examined.
