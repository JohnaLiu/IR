Abstract    :
              This award is for continued studies of long-term climatic change aimed at
              developing a predictive theory that can account for the ever-increasing
              geological proxy evidence for the co-evolution of the climatic variables. 
              These variables can be subdivided into (a) the fast response atmospheric and
              surface state quantities that equilibrate relatively rapidly, and (b) the
              slow-response, high-inertia quantities (e.g., ice sheet mass, deep ocean
              temperature, carbon inventories) that carry the main long-term evolution and
              comprise the "center manifold" of the climate system to which the fast response
              variables are attracted.  The studies involve statistical analyses of the
              relevant time-series records, and theoretical studies based on both general
              circulation models (governing the fast-response, equilibrium, parts of the
              climate system) and dynarnical-system models (governing the slow-response,
              non-equilibrium processes).  The goal is to enlarge upon present theories of
              late Cenozoic climatic evolution in several directions.
