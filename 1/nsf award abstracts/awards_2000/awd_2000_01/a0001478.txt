Abstract    :
              The goal of the collaborative research is to distinguish between the impact of
              climate and land use on ecosystem functioning for eastern Asian steppes. This
              may be possible because, while contiguous regions of Inner Mongolia and
              Mongolia have very similar climates, land use practices can different
              dramatically.  The PIs will determine how much of when 'green-up' occurs is a
              function of climate and how much is a function of land use. The proposed work
              builds on research recently conducted by the authors.  A rich mix of research
              techniques including remote sensing, modeling, field studies and statistical
              analyses will be used.  The work is important because it will lead to better
              understanding of land-surface interactions and vegetation feedbacks in East
              Asia.
