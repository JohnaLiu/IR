Abstract    :
              The principal investigator will, as Secretary-General of the International Union
              of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG), will provide leadership for and assist the
              IUGG to promote and coordinate physical, chemical, and mathematical studies of
              the Earth and its environment in space.  These studies address a number of
              important scientific processes related to, inter alia, the dynamics of the
              Earth as a whole; all aspects of the oceans, the atmosphere and ionosphere; the
              Earth's internal structure; volcanism and rock formation; and the hydrological
              cycle.  Many of these studies contribute to productive global-scale
              interdisciplinary research programs, such as the World Climate Research
              Programme (WCRP); the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP); and
              the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction.  The PI will serve as
              Secretary-General of the IUGG.  She will coordinate activities of the IUGG
              Bureau which manages all affairs of the Union, including development of
              guidance for the IUGG's scientific objectives.  Specific activities to be
              supported include development, maintenance, and updating of an IUGG database,
              especially in electronic format; design, preparation and distribution of IUGG
              publications; and assistance with IUGG news releases.
