Abstract    :
              In Old English (700 - 1150) "Everyone defended him" could be understood as in
              Modern English with 'him' referring to a contextually given individual, or it
              could be understood like "Everyone defended himself", with 'him' understood as
              semantically binding the object of the verb to the subject 'Everyone'. The
              project documents the creation of the reflexive pronouns (c1200) and provides a
              quantitative record of their obligatory use as binders of objects to subjects
              (the 1500s). Using a database of about 7,500 examples of bindings from 800ad to
              1800ad, the study will provide historical explanations for several
              distributional facts about Modern English: notably, why reflexives do not occur
              as possessors (we cannot say "John lost himself's book", though this is common
              in languages with Noun Phrase reflexives), and, much more contentiously with
              regard to current theories of grammar, why bare reflexives can only be locally
              bound (as objects to their subjects, but not for example to subjects of higher
              clauses: we do not say "John believes that Mary defended himself", with
              'himself' understood as bound to 'John'). Finally, the study presents a new
              type of historical change and two new principles governing historical change.
