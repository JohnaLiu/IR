This proposal seeks partial funding to support the
              Hydroinformatics 2000 Conference organized by the Iowa Institute of Hydraulic
              Research during July 23-27, 2000.  This is the fourth conference in a bi-annual
              series, but the first to be held in the United States.  As such, it offers the
              first opportunity to gather a multidisciplinary group of U.S. and international
              researchers to address a wide range of topics and technologies that impact
              water resources planning and management.  The conference details are given in
              www.iihr.uiowa.edu/hydro2000.  NSF funds will be earmarked to support
              participation by leading researchers and practitioners from developing
              countries and countries in Eastern Europe, and participation in associated
              workshops by graduate students from the United States.
