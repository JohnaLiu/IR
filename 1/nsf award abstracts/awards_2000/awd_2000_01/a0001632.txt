The American Association of Botanical Gardens and Arboreta
              (AABGA) is requesting support for the upcoming World Congress to be held in
              Ashville, NC, June 25-30, 2000.  They intend to develop a theme, "Reaching Out:
               Informal Learning in Botanical Gardens," in order to enhance informal learning
              in botanical gardens across the nation.  The theme will be addressed through
              plenary addresses, conference sessions, workshops and tours.  A conference
              publication and a web site will extend the impact of this theme beyond the
              conference.
