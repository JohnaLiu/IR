Abstract    :
              This project is intended to push technologies derived from the human genome
              project to their current limits, to characterize the genomes of uncultivated
              marine archaea.  These archaea represent 15% or more of all prokaryotic cells
              in the worlds oceans, yet their biochemistry, physiology, and ecological
              significance is unknown.  The approach involves isolation of extremely large
              (150-300 kb) genomic fragments from uncultivated planktonic archaea in
              Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clone libraries.  A BAC clone library
              with such extremely large inserts has never before been reported from a mixed
              natural microbial population.  By pushing the current limits of genomic
              technologies and applying them in mixed populations, the investigators aim to
              improve the current knowledge of enigmatic but important uncultivated microbes,
              specifically marine planktonic archaea.  The work will also provide improved
              generic methodologies for the genomic and functional characterization of
              uncultivated microorganisms and determination of their functional properties.
