Abstract    :
              This award is for an exploratory study of evidence for long-term paleo-ENSO (El
              Nino-Southern Oscillation) cycles in the central United States, as reflected in
              evidence for fluctuations the ratio of C3/C4 vegetation types preserved in
              soils. Stable carbon isotope ratios and soil organic matter will be used as an
              indicator of the long-term average C3/C4 plant ratios. The stable isotope
              analyses will be done exclusively on rhizoconcretions (secondary carbonate
              encrustations on root tubes). Age control will be provided by radiocarbon
              analyses of soil organic matter and fossil remains.
