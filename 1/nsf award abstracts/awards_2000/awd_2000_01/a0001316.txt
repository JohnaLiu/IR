              Abstract
                         Levin #0001316


	Why do two persons,
              faced with exactly the same decision, decide differently? Tile
	existence of
              individual differences in judgment and decision making has been widely
	noted
              but riot many previous studies have focused on identifying the
              antecedent
	conditions. Tin this proposal we focus on stable person
              characteristics that relate to the
	manner in which information is processed
              in arriving at a judgment or decision. The
	proposed experiments will provide
              links between individual difference indices and
	measures of the process by
              which a decision maker reaches his or her final choice.
	Individual difference
              measures to be used in the proposed research include personality
	factors such
              as extraversion and neuroticiscn which have been shown in previous
              research
	to account for significant variance in various tasks in memory and
              cognition, measures of
	affective state, and most notably, a measure of
              cognitive style widely and successfully
	used in the areas of persuasion and
              attitude change but only recently used in the area of
	judgment. and decision
              making. Such measures should provide us with new insights into
	why, in the
              same situation, one person will decide one way and another person will
	decide
              the other way.
