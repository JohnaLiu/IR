This award provides partial support for 20
              representatives from the U.S. to attend the 16th IFIP World Computer Congress,
              in Beijing, China, August 21 - 25, 2000.  The International Federation for
              Information Processing (IFIP) is a multinational federation of technical
              organizations concerned with information processing.  The ACM and the IEEE
              Computer Society are full members of IFIP and the ACM is administering this
              project.  The participants in the project are selected on a competitive basis
              by a committee of reviewers, with emphasis given to young researchers doing
              outstanding work and to applicants who have been accepted to present papers or
              are otherwise significantly involved in the conference.
