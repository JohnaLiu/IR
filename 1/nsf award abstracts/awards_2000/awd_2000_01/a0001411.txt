Abstract

This work involves the application of
              flow visualization and particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques to studies
              of heat and mass transfer in He II.  The purpose is to obtain the capability to
              investigate microscopic scale thermal fluid issues in He II, so that the fluid
              can be better utilized as a coolant in applications. The effort will first
              focus on techniques to introduce suitable neutral density particles into
              experiments with a He II counterflow/forced flow channel. Neutral particles to
              be investigated include solid H2/D2 and hollow glass microspheres.  Once
              particle seeding techniques have been developed, PIV experiments will
              investigate the microscale fluid dynamics of the He II channel. The experiments
              will be performed in a cryostat equipped with optical access.  If successful,
              this will be the first demonstration of PIV in He II and the only particle
              imaging study in counterflow or forced flow He II.  It will also be a clear
              indication of the value of PIV for cryogenic thermal fluid studies.
