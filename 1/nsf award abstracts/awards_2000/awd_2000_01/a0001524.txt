Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to electrospin oligomeric titanium
              dioxide/silicon dioxide precursor solutions to control the formation of
              catalytic nanorods.  Electrospinning is a process by which a charged jet is
              ejected from a capillary tube.  Through an external electric field the jet is
              elongated and accelerated.  The PI has previously demonstrated the ability to
              electrospin soluble polymers to produce fibers in the 3 nm to sub-micron
              diameter range.  This technique has the potential for cost-effective
              electromechanical control of catalytic fiber size, shape, molecular
              orientation, and properties, as well as control of fiber placement for
              integrated manufacturing of two-and three dimensional nanofiber assemblies. 
              Surface areas of 200 m2/g are feasible.  The PIs will synthesize and test
              several catalyst systems suitable for the catalytic partial oxidation of
              cyclooctene in the presence of peroxides.  If successful, this project has the
              potential to guide a new manufacturing technique for the production of
              catalysts on nanofibers.
