Abstract    :
              The objective of the project is to identify the mantle component in island arc
              volcanism by performing an across-arc study of magmatism in the southern
              Mariana Arc. The PIs propose to answer three principal questions using a field
              and laboratory study of submarine volcanoes in the Southern Seamount Province
              of the Mariana Arc.  1) Is the pattern of mantle depletion across the arc and
              the back-arc consistent with sequential melting of the mantle as it moves away
              from the back-arc spreading axis? 2) What is the inherent heterogeneity of the
              subarc mantle at scales of 10-60 km? 3) How are melts aggregated in arcs? They
              will answer these questions using a field program based on a high-resolution 
              survey of two portions of the Southern Seamount Province, from the arc to the
              back-arc, using the Hawaii MR-1 towed vehicle; through detailed sampling of two
              traverses of the Province (including lavas and volcaniclastics); through
              characterization of the sampled materials petrographically and geochemically;
              and through interpretation of the data to identify the roles of along axis
              mantle heterogeneity.
