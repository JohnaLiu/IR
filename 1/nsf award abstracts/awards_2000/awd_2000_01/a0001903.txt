Abstract    :
              This research will provide an economic analysis of sequential contracting among
              vertically related firms. The goal of the research is to develop new theory,
              integrate existing theory, shed new light on some important contracting
              strategies, and offer guidance for antitrust policy makers.

The agenda is
              timely in that it addresses some of the major current policy concerns in
              antitrust, including the use of exclusivity agreements (exclusive dealing and
              exclusive territories) in monopolization cases, the role of countervailing
              buyer power in merger analysis, the economic effects of slotting allowances
              (lump-sum payments from manufacturers to retailers), and whether and why large
              buyers might negotiate most-favored-customer clauses in their supply contracts.
              In addition, it will shed new light on when price discrimination in
              intermediate goods markets may be harmful and, hence, when enforcement of the
              Robinson-Patman Act may be in the social interest.
