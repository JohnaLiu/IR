In this collaborative project, the investigators aim at
              making progress on how to resolve lateral variations in water content between
              oceans and continents in the upper mantle, an issue of importance for our
              understanding of evolution and dynamics of the continental lithosphere. To this
              effect, they will combine seismological and mineral physics tools. On the
              mineral physics side, they will work on finding a suitable parameterization
              through which the effect of water on seismic velocity and attenuation is
              properly accounted for.  On the seismology side, they will test possible
              parameterizations provided by the mineral physics group on a global seismic
              waveform dataset, which will be assembled during the course of this project and
              corrected for crustal effects, as compiled from the literature.
