As exotic material accretes to a
              continental margin by convergent tectonics, a number of important changes in
              conditions occurs, some of which lead to production of magma that subsequently
              becomes involved in the ongoing structural development of the accretion.  As
              tonalitic plutons are commonly generated as continental margin arcs accrete,
              their composition provides information about the P-T-X H2O conditions of the
              source region, and combined with fabric and structural data, provide
              constraints for the transport and emplacement processes that might lead to
              chemical modification of magmas as they traverse and are emplaced in the crust.
               The project will utilize a suite of tonalitic plutons on Revillagigedo Island
              in southeastern Alaska that record early stages of continental arc magmatism. 
              Results are expected to detail and track the origin, modification and tectonic
              interactions of these magmas in this convergent setting.
