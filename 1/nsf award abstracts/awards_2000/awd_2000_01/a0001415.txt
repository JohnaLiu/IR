This award supports a planning visit for Professor John
              Tharakan, Howard University, to travel to the Murugappa Chettiar Research
              Center (MCRC) in Chennai, India to finalize the collaborative research
              proposal, Investigation and Comparison of Gut Microbial Ecology in
              Vermicomposting.  The investigators will study tropical and temperate
              vermicomposting systems for the treatment of recalcitrant industrial wastes. 
              The MCRC focuses on conducting sustainable and appropriate scientific and
              technological research that will improve living conditions and quality of life
              for Indian rural populations.
