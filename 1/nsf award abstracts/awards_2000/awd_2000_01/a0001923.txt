Abstract    :
              0001923  Leckie  The objective of this research is to elucidate the dominant
              processes governing the fate of heavy metals in soil and groundwater
              environments.  This research will focus specifically on a well-controlled model
              biogeochemical system consisting of a chelator (citric acid), a mineral surface
              (goethite), a pure microbial culture (Pseudomonas fluorescens), the heavy metal
              uranium U(VI) as the uranyl ion (UO22+), and CO2.  First, experiments with four
              sub-systems will be performed to closely evaluate the mechanisms which may play
              a role in the fate of uranyl.  These sub-systems include: (1) a system of
              uranyl-citrate-geothite, without bacteria, to determine the effect of citrate
              on the sorption of uranyl on geothite, (2) a uranyl-citrate-microbe system,
              without the solid phase, to determine the microbial interactions with the
              system components, (3) a uranyl-geothite-microbe system to determine behavior
              in the absence of citrate, (4) a system without the uranyl ion to determine the
              effect of citrate sorption on its biodegradation.  In the second phase, the
              overall biogeochemical system will be investigated to determine the mechanisms
              affecting the overall partitioning of uranyl. ***
