This grant provides partial support of the costs of
              upgrading computational equipment within the Geosciences Department at Penn
              State University (PSU).  High end multi-CPU servers and networked workstations
              will allow sharing of computational resources by various targeted research
              groups, postdocs, and graduate and undergraduate students.  The equipment will
              be used for a wide array of compute intensive research in the earth sciences
              including: seismological research aimed at elucidating the structure of
              continental crust and volcanic plumbing systems; studies of the geodynamic
              evolution of active plate margins; modeling of fluvial erosional processes and
              landscape evolution; modeling basin sedimentation processes; and simulations of
              chemical reactions and kinetics at mineral-water interfaces.
