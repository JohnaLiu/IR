Abstract    :
              The proposed research will examine whether and how variation in judicial
              decision making affects the psychological and health-related adjustment of
              families after child custody litigation.  This proposed research will be the
              fourth phase of a longitudinal study (UCI Child Custody Study) that was
              conducted as part of the author's dissertation research.  The study will retain
              the subject pool (N=117), and the main features of the original research.  A
              longitudinal, repeated-measures design and MANOVA and multiple regression
              procedures will be used to examine whether procedural and distributive justice
              are related to measures of family adjustment in the long term.  This proposed
              study will establish a first, direct link between parents' subjective courtroom
              experience and evidence of subsequent long-term adjustment.  Findings that
              families are influenced in their adjustment by their perceptions of the quality
              of judicial decision-making could have far-reaching implications for the work
              of research psychologists as well as that of health and legal professionals. 
              Involvement in the research process will also, contribute to the educational
              development of undergraduate and Master's Degree students.
