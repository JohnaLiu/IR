Abstract    :
              The investigators will study intense substorm growth phase events using multiple
              observations.  Some intense growth phase events do not lead to well-defined
              substorms, suggesting a different kind of energy release mechanism.  Intense
              growth phase events will be identified from a database containing solar wind
              data, auroral imaging data, particle precipitation measurements, and
              ground-based magnetometer and radar observations.  The data will be studied to
              determine criteria for predicting strong growth phase events.  The observations
              collectively will allow the investigators to identify the cause of intense
              growth phase events and understand why some do not develop into strong clear
              substorms.  Because strong growth phase events are often assumed to be
              precursors to strong substorms, this study will help eliminate false alarms in
              the prediction of space weather effects on technological systems such as
              communications and power lines.
