The
              collaborative research will examine coupling between the troposphere and
              stratosphere. 
Until recently, the dynamical coupling has been regarded as
              uni-directional with tropospheric planetary waves propagating upwards, and
              inducing changes in stratospheric dynamical fields. Recent evidence indicates
              variations in the stratospheric polar vortex can also directly induce
              significant circulation anomalies in the troposphere. The PIs propose to study
              the coupling between stratosphere and troposphere during intraseasonal AO
              events, by applying potential vorticity (PV) and diagnostic modeling
              approaches, to both observational analyses and mechanistic numerical modeling
              experiment. The work is important because it will increase our knowledge and
              understanding of high latitude climate variability due to the Arctic
              Oscillation
