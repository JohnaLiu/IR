Abstract    :
              


Indigenous languages now disappear at an increasing rate. Activists and
              educators in a Yup'ik Eskimo village in southwestern Alaska motivate language
              revitalization efforts by emphasizing the importance of preserving Central
              Alaskan Yup'ik as part of a rich cultural heritage. Yet resulting ideological
              notions of linguistic purism stigmatize current youth language practices,
              creating linguistic insecurity in speakers crucial to the language's future.
              This dissertation focuses on effects of this contradiction by identifying how
              youth perceive, enact and/or reconfigure language ideologies in daily language
              practices, and how they influence younger children's language use through
              socialization networks. Ethnographic and sociolinguistic methods will 1)
              examine assumptions about bilingualism and language revitalization underlying
              educational and legal policies; 2) demonstrate how these policies constrain
              definitions of language ability and learn-ability locally and 3) document
              linguistic practices of 12 bilingual youth (ages 7-20) from four nuclear
              families as they interact in family and peer clusters over a year. Findings
              contribute to language ideology research by describing in detail how youth
              culture affects linguistic norms and ideology's enactment in bilingual
              communities. Language planners will find useful this case study of how language
              ideologies are interpreted and deployed by the young people on whom language
              revitalization efforts depend.
