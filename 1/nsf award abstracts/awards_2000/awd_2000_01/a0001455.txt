This is a one-day workshop in Mechatronics
              Education to be held as part of the Mechatronics 2000 Conference in Atlanta,
              Georgia, in September of 2000. The purpose of the workshop is to bring
              mechatronics educators and scholars from around the world together to discuss
              and share their experiences on how to best teach mechatronics, how to design
              mechatronics laboratories and curricula, and how to integrate mechatronics
              research and teaching effectively. Part of the information disseminated will
              come from a previous NSF grant to the PI. Mechatronics scholars who are already
              attending the conference from the United States, Japan, and Europe will be
              available to serve as panelists and presenters at the workshop.
