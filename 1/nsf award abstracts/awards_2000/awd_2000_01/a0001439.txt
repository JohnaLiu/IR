The project will plan and conduct a conference among U.S. and
              Japanese mathematics educators (e.g., teachers, researchers, teacher educators)
              focused on exploring the similarities and differences in teacher professional
              development for elementary school mathematics teachers.  There will be 40
              participants, split evenly between U.S. and Japanese delegations.  The
              conference would be held in August, 2000, immediately following the Ninth
              International Congress on Mathematics Education (ICME 9).  Two products would
              be developed after the conference.  The first is a set of proceedings
              (available in print and stored on the web) that would include summaries of
              discussions and activities as well as a series of commissioned papers that
              would explore issues raised at the conference.  The second is an edited video
              of conference discussions and activities.  One of the planned conference
              activities is a simulation/presentation of Japanese "study groups" that are
              often part of Japanese teachers' professional development.  The video will
              attempt to capture some of the essential features of this demonstration so that
              U.S. educators who did not attend could gain some insight into the nature of
              that kind of professional development activity.  During 2000 and 2001, the
              project staff will make presentations at a variety of professional conferences
              to share the proceedings (both print and video) with mathematics educators
              throughout the U.S.
