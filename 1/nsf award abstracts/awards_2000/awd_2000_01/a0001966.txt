This is a renewal of a collaborative project
              in which a seismologist and a geodynamicist (with their students) work closely
              together to understand the dynamics and fine structure of the lower mantle. The
              investigators have focussed on this region of the deep Earth because it plays
              such an important role in controlling the thermal and chemical state and
              evolution of the entire planet. In this project, seismological and geodynamical
              methodologies are tightly integrated. Geodynamical models (some integrated to
              the geological evolution of surface plates) are used to study: The dynamics of
              upwelling regions with large variations in viscosity, partial melting, and
              chemical heterogeneity; strong, cold slabs interacting with thermo-chemical
              boundary layers; and lateral transition regions between upwellings and
              downwellings. These thermo-chemical structures are mapped into two- and
              three-dimensional seismic velocity fields so that dynamic models are directly
              tested against observed waveforms, differential travel times, and tomography.
              The dynamic models motivate the collection of new data while also suggesting
              new ways to interpret seismic models. This approach has lead to an acceleration
              in our understanding of Earth processes.
