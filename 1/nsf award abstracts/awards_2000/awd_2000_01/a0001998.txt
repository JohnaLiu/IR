Abstract    :
                  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will examine how firms are able to
              effectively share knowledge across diverse functions and perspectives during
              enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems implementation. The primary
              objective of the study is to provide a theoretically grounded assessment of
              factors that enable firms to articulate and integrate the diversity of
              knowledge required for effective use of ERP. This includes factors that impact
              how existing knowledge is shared and how new knowledge is absorbed and
              transferred to become part of the firm's core knowledge competency. Following a
              case-study protocol, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with ERP team
              members in participating firms by telephone and on site.Computer-aided text
              analysis of the corrected transcripts will be used for within-site and
              between-site response comparisons, addressing seven propositions in the
              proposal. Among other variables and issues to be addressed is whether firm
              cultures that emphasizes group over individual achievement are more
              process/outcome oriented than deadline driven (Proposition 1). The interview
              protocol will include questions on organization structure, organization
              culture, process versus deadline orientation, the incorporation of new
              knowledge into core knowledge competencies, and tacit knowledge sharing.
