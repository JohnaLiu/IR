Abstract    :
              
This proposal seeks funds to organize a workshop and produce a report on new
              directions of research in solid mechanics.  Special attention will be given to
              critical areas of importance to national economic well being, public health,
              safety and national security as well as areas of fundamental scientific impact
              on solid mechanics.  The workshop will be held in fall 2000 with a pre-workshop
              information meeting to be held at the ICTAM 2000 meeting in Chicago, August
              2000.  The American Academy of Mechanics will provide the organizational and
              communication structure.  The AAM will invite participation from a wide
              spectrum of researcher in solid mechanics and related fields.  Attempts will be
              made to involve both younger and senior researchers as well as researchers form
              diverse backgrounds.  A final report will be delivered around late spring 2001
              and will be published in a journal as well as posted on the AAM web site.
