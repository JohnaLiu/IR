Abstract    :
              Measurements of atmospheric dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) will
              be made at Baring Head, New Zealand, using a new isotope dilution GC/MS
              instrument. The scientific goal of this project is to construct a budget for
              SO2 in the Southern Ocean marine boundary layer. Specifically, atmospheric DMS
              and SO2 will be measured simultaneously over at least ten diurnal cycles, the
              DMS to SO2 conversion efficiencies will be determined, as well as the relative
              magnitude of SO2 loss to clouds, sea salt aerosols and the sea surface. The
              field data will be interpreted using a photochemical box model. The long term
              objectives of this project are to investigate the relationship between the
              photochemical state of the atmosphere and the oxidation rates and pathways of
              sulfur gases and to improve our understanding of the relationship between
              sulfur gas precursors and the production and growth of aerosols.
