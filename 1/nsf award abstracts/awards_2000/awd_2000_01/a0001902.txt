Abstract    :
              Recommended project is for a comprehensive geochemical and geochronological
              examination of Eocene to Miocene volcanism in the southern arc and backarc of
              the Izu-Bonin-Marianas (IBM) arc system, tracing its older development with
              time.  In doing so, the recommended research will also re-examine
              well-characterized samples that have been previously investigated using older,
              obsolescent anayltical techniques.  This study will examine the changing nature
              of volcanism in the IBM system, as it transformed from "boninitic" volcanism
              associated with subduction initiation to the more "normal" tholeitic and
              cal-clkaline arc volcanism also seen today in the modern volcanic arc and
              backarc.  This study also will examine the changing nature of the mantle
              sources during this transformation, as well as the implications they carry for
              tectonic processes during the arc system evolution.  Previously sampled lavas
              and other volcanic rocks will be supplemented by collection of new samples
              during field work on Guam; all of these samples will be analyzed for major and
              trace elemental composition, isotopic composition, and geochronological (40 Ar
              - 39 Ar) dating using the latest analytical techniques.
