Abstract    :
              This dissertation investigates the relationship between civil rights, liberalism
              and the politics of race in Britain between 1948 and 1968, a period that
              witnessed profound transformations in popular and legal definitions of civil
              rights, and in anti-racist political mobilization.  It will address two
              questions related to the historical evolution of liberal though and the
              philosophical bases of Anglo-American legal practice. First, how were the
              unstable boundaries between state and society demarcated along the lines of
              race after1945, when advocates of minority concerns increasingly defined civil
              rights in terms of the state's responsibility to prevent discrimination in the
              private sector? Second, how did members of both anti-racist organizations and
              the legal profession assess the efficacy of working within liberal and
              egalitarian framework to advance minority concerns?

	The project focuses
              largely on the relationship between the National Council for Civil Liberties
              (NCCL), an organization with a central role in Britain's civil rights history,
              and numerous organizations mobilized specifically around anti-racism.  The data
              consists of original documents associated with the history of these
              organizations, including materials associated with discrimination suits,
              newsletters, and other public records and reports.  The questions addressed by
              this project are relevant to understanding the historical development of
              current debates in Britain over the possible enactment of a bill of rights
              modeled on that of the United States and by current debates surrounding
              affirmative actions in the United States.
