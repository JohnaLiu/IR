This project will investigate the relationship between
              recent socioeconomic and environmental changes in South India and changing
              respiratory health/disease patterns; specifically, the prevalence of asthma has
              increased dramatically in this region. The research will focus on Indians'
              explanatory models of this disease and its presumed causes. It will examine how
              the experience of, and explanations for, asthma influence health-care seeking
              and management in a setting of medical pluralism, and how these vary by class,
              caste, and gender. It will specifically analyze how local models/perceptions
              may be contributing to poor management of the disease.  Two south Indian
              communities that have experienced different kinds of socioeconomic and
              environmental change-- an industrial town and a rural village -- will be
              compared. Methods include structured interviews with samples of households, the
              elicitation of factors causing asthma, an analysis of medications utilized, and
              a health services study of local pharmacies and drug vendors. This research
              will contribute to our understanding of the relationship between
              economic/environmental change and deteriorating respiratory health in many
              parts of the industrialized, developing world.
