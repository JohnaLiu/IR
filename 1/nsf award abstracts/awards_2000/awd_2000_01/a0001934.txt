Abstract    :
              	This project supports the deployment of a Twin Otter aircraft and ground-based
              measurements as part of ACE-Asia (Aerosol Characterization Experiment). A
              comprehensive instrument package for the Twin Otter will be available for
              measurements of aerosol physical, chemical, and optical properties, including
              size distribution, hygroscopic properties (Tandem Differential Mobility
              Analyzer), size-segregated chemistry, and a novel single particle spectrometer.
              The objectives of the research flights are to characterize the aerosol in the
              Asian outflow region and to perform local and column radiative closure studies.
              In collaboration with a scientist at HKUST (Hong Kong University of Science and
              Technology), aerosol samples collected by the aircraft and at ground stations
              in Cheju Island, Korea, and other locations will be analyzed for
              organic/elemental carbon (EC/OC) and speciated organics via extraction,
              derivatization, and GC/MS analysis. Modeling studies will be performed in
              collaboration with Dr. Carmichael (University of Iowa) using a
              three-dimensional atmospheric chemical transport model which includes gas-phase
              chemistry, aerosol microphysics, thermodynamics, gas/particle conversion and
              anthropogenic emissions.
