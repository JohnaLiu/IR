Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Biomolecular
              Processes and is entitled "Understanding Recombinational DNA Repair Initiation:
              A Kinetic Analysis of RecA-DNA Complex Formation".  This research seeks to
              provide a complete analysis of the functioning of RecA, a protein involved in
              recombinational DNA repair.  Until now, the molecular mechanisms by which it
              functions have not been described.  Of particular interest is whether or not
              ATP induces a conformational change of RecA into an active state, prior to DNA
              binding.  Spectroscopic signal changes from fluorescent oligonucleotides
              (multiple DNA bases linked in series) are used to detect DNA binding (i.e.
              formation of the RecA-DNA complex), while complex formation is followed in
              real-time using stopped-flow techniques.  The specific  molecular steps
              involved are being characterized.
