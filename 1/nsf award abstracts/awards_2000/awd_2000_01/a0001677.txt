Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is  to produce computer tools for the Community
              Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC).  It is the development of an enabling
              technology that will facilitate the use of the CCMC for space weather research.
              Industry standard message passing techniques will be used to allow different
              models to be coupled together.  Similar tools will provide access to archive
              and real-time data.  In addition, easy-to-use graphical display systems will be
              developed. This computer architecture will facilitate the transition of
              research models to operational models, which is one of the main purposes of the
              CCMC.
