Abstract    :
              DGE-0001789

I am requesting the funds from this starter research grant to
              first complete the implementation of these course at all three institutions
              (FAMU, FSU, and TCC).  Second, I want to evaluate and compare the effectiveness
              of this teaching style at each of these settings.  Course assessment strategies
              will include self-evaluations. When selecting the evaluation (by mentors and
              colleagues), and student evaluations.  When selecting the appropriate
              assessment tools for the student and peer evaluations I will rely heavily upon
              the advice of my colleagues in science education as well as my other PFSMETE
              Fellows that have expertise in this area.
