Abstract    :
              The Passamaquoddy-Maliseet Dictionary project builds on the first phase of
              research, 1996 to 1999 (NSF Grant No. SBR-9601540), which produced a
              compilation of more than 16,000 words and the initial editing and elaboration
              of entries. During Phase II, the Principal Investigators will complete the
              entries and the other sections of the dictionary, which include a grammatical
              sketch, noun and verb paradigms, an index of noun and verb roots, sound-files,
              and textual and pictorial illustrations. Entries will be added to a dictionary
              website, and a print edition will be prepared.

The Principal Investigators,
              along with participating linguists and community research assistants, will work
              closely with speakers in the communities where Passamaquoddy-Maliseet is spoken
              today to enhance and supplement dictionary entries, and to assure the
              usefulness and appropriateness of the dictionary, its accessibility, and its
              pedagogical value. A community survey will document variations in lexicon,
              usage, verb and noun inflections, pitch/stress, and other features of the
              language, for inclusion in the dictionary. The goal is a dictionary useful to
              the work of teachers and students, writers and researchers in Passamaquoddy and
              Maliseet communities and beyond.
