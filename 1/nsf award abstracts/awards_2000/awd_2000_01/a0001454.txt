This special project is a three day workshop
              focused on the implementation of case study methodology in engineering
              education. The objectives of the workshop are for participants to: learn about
              the use of case study methodology in engineering courses, participate in
              real-world case studies where engineering decisions have a major impact, use
              multimedia materials to enhance learning, benefit from collaboration between
              engineering and business in solving real-world problems, use case studies to
              address the ABET EC2000 accreditation criteria. In addition, the workshop
              encourages participants to implement case study methodology at their
              institutions and points out various ways to support such efforts.
