Proposal Title: Space Weather: An Operational Sun to
              Earth Model

Principal Investigator: Charles N. Arge, University of Colorado
              

The investigators will develop a simplified model to explore issues
              relating to operational aspects of Sun-Earth space weather models. The main
              effort is to combine a set of readily modified models in a modular architecture
              to allow extensive experimentation with ingesting and assimilating real time
              data, error handling, linkages, verification, display, archiving, and other
              operational requirements. The set of models will consist of simple
              physics-based and semi-empirical models, as well as modest magnetohydrodynamic
              (MHD) models that can be run efficiently on workstations. The model will be
              made available to the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) so that may
              become an operational tool accessible to the space weather community.
