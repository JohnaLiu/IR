Abstract    :
              This project will examine the visual information used by people to perceive and
              control their locomotion through the environment.  The research will evaluate a
              model in which two different types of visual information are used in
              locomotion.  One type of information is based on specific aspects of motion
              perception that involve the activation of neural mechanisms responsible for
              detecting expansion or looming.  The second type of information is based on
              changes in scene position available in static views of the world and uses scene
              layout information based on landmarks.  The experiments will examine a number
              of issues, including the importance of ordinal depth information in the scene,
              the information provided by scene landmarks, the temporal characteristics of
              how the brain encodes information for locomotion, and how the two types of
              information are integrated by the visual system for the control of locomotion. 
              The results of these experiments will increase our understanding of the visual
              information used by the human brain to control navigation through the
              environment.  In addition, these results will be of use in the development of
              robotic vision systems that navigate through the environment.
