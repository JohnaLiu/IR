Abstract    :
              Combining information from the 1970, 1980, and 1990 censuses of the population
              with African-American homicide offending data in the United States for the
              period 1976-1994, this research examines, empirically, the relative efficacy of
              two powerful explanatory schemes:  One proposed by Wilson suggesting that the
              most important determinant of the relationship between race and crime is the
              concentration of African-Americans in structurally disorganized communities. 
              The competing theory, proposed by Massey et al., argues that the interaction of
              racial residential segregation and poverty is more relevant in causing
              accelerating rates of African-American homicide and victimization.  The
              analytic method for the research is hierarchical linear growth curve analysis.
              Data on rates of African-American homicide offending will be nested within
              counties over the period 1976-1994. The Level-1 model estimates the changes in
              African-American homicide offending rates within each county, over time. The
              parameters of these trajectories (the intercept, slope, and acceleration of the
              trend lines) describe the nature of change in the homicide offending rates. The
              Level-2 model estimates differences between counties in these trends.  The
              importance of the research lies in the promise of increased understanding of
              the forces that foster urban violence, the leading cause of death among young
              black males.
