Abstract    :
              0001385  Todd  The goals of this research are the development and field-testing
              of an innovative real-time method for measuring, visualizing and quantifying
              chemical air emissions and emission rates.  With the proposed method,
              two-dimensional pollutant concentration maps of large areas are generated using
              an environmental CAT (computer assisted tomography) scanning system that
              couples the chemical detection technology of open-path Fourier transform
              infrared (OP-FTIR) spectroscopy with the mapping capabilities of computer
              assisted tomography.  In the proposed system, several OP-FTIR spectrometers
              transmit beams of infrared light along open beam paths (up to one kilometer,
              approximately) to simultaneously measure and identify a wide range of multiple
              contaminants directly in the atmosphere, typically at part per billion or part
              per million detection levels.  The tomographic system uses a mathematical image
              reconstruction algorithm to process the multiple data into two-dimensional
              chemical maps.  If successful, this method will allow concentrations to be
              spatially resolved in real-time over large areas with fewer measurements than
              would be required with conventional point samplers to obtain the same level of
              detail. ***
