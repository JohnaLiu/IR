The goal of the Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Center for Biocatalysis and Bioprocessing of Macromolecules at the Polytechnic
              University of New York is to conduct research on a wide range of issues
              applicable to the use of biocatalytic methods in polymer synthesis and
              materials processing.  The research program includes three themes:  (1)
              In-vitro enzyme-catalyzed polymer synthesis and modification; (2) Biocatalytic
              degradation of polymers; and (3) Biosynthesis of novel polysaccharide
              copolymers.  The Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) consisting of representatives
              from nine participating companies review the progress of research, and provides
              guidance to the Center's management and technology transfer activities.
