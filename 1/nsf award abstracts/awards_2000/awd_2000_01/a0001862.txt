Abstract    :
              This dissertation project attempts to identify the acoustic features of
              Spanish-accented speech that give it the perception of being 'accented'. While
              considerable information is available on phonological aspects of
              Spanish-accented English, only a limited amount of research has been conducted
              on the objective acoustic features. In this study, Spanish speakers of English
              and native speakers of American English will be recorded, and speech samples
              will be compared in terms of temporal acoustic measurements, e.g. vowel
              duration, consonant duration, and stop voice onset time. These measurements
              will provide descriptive data for the timing of Spanish-accented English.  The
              second part of the study is experimental. Having identified the temporal
              differences, the researchers will select those features which differ most
              consistently across the two groups of speakers. These features will be
              acoustically modified by waveform editing for the Spanish-accented speakers to
              bring them into accord with the measurements of the native (unaccented)
              speakers. The modified and unmodified speech of the accented speakers will then
              be subjected to listener ratings for relative accent judgments. The aim is to
              determine the extent to which temporal modification makes accented speech less
              accented and more native-like.
