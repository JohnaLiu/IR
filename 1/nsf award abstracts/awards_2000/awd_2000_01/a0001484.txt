	This award provides partial (50%) funding support for the
              acquisition of a laser ablation inductively coupled plasma source
              multicollector mass spectrometer (LA-ICP-MCMS) system to be installed and
              operated in the GeoAnalytical Laboratory at Washington State University.
              Washington State University is committed to provide the remaining funding
              required for the acquisition. The new instrument will be used in research and
              training of graduate students requiring precise microanalysis of elemental and
              isotopic compositions.
