This project will investigate the relationship between
              gender, alcohol use and spirit possession in Chuuk, Micronesia. As male alcohol
              abuse increased in the 1970s and became a significant social problem on Chuuk,
              female spirit possession appeared. The researcher hypothesizes that spirit
              possession is a moral discourse that may assist women in the control of alcohol
              related problems with men. An urban and rural community will be compared in
              order to situate the research in areas where alcohol abuse is relatively more
              or less of a problem. The study will focus on women's religious lives and how
              they utilize spirituality to respond to male drinking and abuse. Methods
              include a community census, archival research, participant observation and
              intensive interviewing. This study will contribute to our theoretical
              understanding of the relationship between innovative religious practice and
              rapid social change, and will also contribute important information on alcohol
              abuse patterns in this area of the world.
