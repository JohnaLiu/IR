Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Population Biology
              and is entitled, "Elucidation of Paleobiogeographic Patterns of Late
              Oligocene/Miocene Time Period".  This project assesses the effects of
              large-scale tectonic and climatic perturbations from 30 to 5 million years ago
              in the western United States on the distributions of fossil and extant
              mammalian taxa.  These effects are determined through the use of a GIS database
              of fossil taxa, Parsimony Analysis of Endemicity, and biogeographic information
              on extant taxa.  Three hypotheses are tested: 1. Large-scale tectonic changes
              between thirty and five million years ago restricted gene flow and increased
              endemism in mammals; 2. Modern biogeographic patterns are more deeply rooted in
              Earth history rather than being the result of recent climatic events such as
              Pleistocene glaciation; 3. Mammalian species behave individualistically during
              times of climate change as opposed to maintaining static species' associations.
               This study will provide a better understanding of the role played by the
              physical environment on evolution as well as an increased understanding of how
              future climate and tectonic changes will affect biodiversity.
