Abstract    :
              	This project investigates the outcome of civil wars:  under what conditions do
              the parties to a civil war choose to end the war by negotiation, and who
              prevails when negotiations fail.  The researcher develops a formal model that
              holds war termination to be the outcome of rational choices that both sides
              make by comparing their expected utility from fighting and from negotiation --
              including the risk that one's opponent may renege on an agreement.  Changes in
              the military balance, the level of costs suffered by each side, and the level
              of external intervention determine how a civil war ends.
	Hypotheses are
              derived from this game-theoretic model by using a computer program written by
              the researcher that generates approximate solutions to the game.  After further
              refinement of this formal model, these hypotheses are tested using data from
              all civil wars fought and terminated from 1816 to 1997.  Further research and
              coding are necessary to measure the military balance and relative casualty
              levels and final war outcome for some of these wars.  In addition to increasing
              significantly our understanding of how civil wars end, the project provides a
              common data resource with which others may develop and test theories.
