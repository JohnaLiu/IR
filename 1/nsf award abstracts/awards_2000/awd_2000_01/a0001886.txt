This project will integrate institutional economics (common
              property theory) and human evolutionary ecology (decision theory) to
              investigate sustainable wood use in an agropastoralist system in Tanzania.
              Focusing on issues of resource sustainability and human/environmental impacts,
              the researcher will identify the behavioral mechanisms that shape differential
              household wood use, and quantify rates of wood consumption in two ethnic groups
              of the Rukwa Region. Two hypotheses regarding the factors that shape wood
              consumption patterns will be tested.  Methods include household surveys in
              three villages, structured interviewing, focus groups, and quantitative
              measures of wood extraction and tree species growth. This study will contribute
              to our understanding of the relationship between indigenous values on resource
              conservation and the actual effects of population resource use on
              conservation.
