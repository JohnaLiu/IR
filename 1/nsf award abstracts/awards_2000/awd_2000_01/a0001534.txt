Abstract    :
              The recent advances in computer and network technologies and storage, and the
              vast increase in data availability from sources such as the Internet and
              satellites present a new challenge to the ways data and information are used
              and managed. The objective of the workshop is to bring together the PIs and
              Co-PIs currently funded by the Information and Data Management Program (IDM) of
              the National Science Foundation to: (1) cooperatively identify the problems
              that are fundamental in making progress toward this new challenge, specify
              areas where major breakthroughs appear possible, identify needed
              collaborations, and identify research initiatives and facilities needed to meet
              the challenge; (2) provide demonstrations and interact with each other on the
              objectives, contributions and challenges of major research activities funded by
              the IDM; and (3) provide an opportunity to program officers from NSF and other
              government agencies, and industry representatives to learn more about the
              current research efforts and successes of projects funded by IDM, and for such
              officers to share their program highlights and concerns. The workshop will
              generate a report on all projects currently funded by IDM in both hard copy and
              electronic form. It will help in formulating future directions of research and
              will suggest promising modalities of research with an aim to foster innovation
              and technology transfer. The proceedings will provide project information
              searchable by different criteria and provide connections between discoveries
              and their use to society.
