Abstract    :
              Dual systems consisting of R/C walls and moment resisting frames are commonly
              used for moderate and high rise buildings in seismic zones. Openings for doors
              and windows are typically used in R/C walls, splitting them into two or more
              walls coupled by deep and short elements, known as coupling beams. To avoid
              severe stiffness and strength degradation in these beams, a diagonal
              reinforcement detail is used. However, such a detail is difficult to construct
              and leads to significant bar congestion in coupling beams. The proposed
              research is aimed at investigating experimentally and analytically the behavior
              of fiber reinforced coupling beams under earthquake loading. It is expected
              that the use of fiber reinforced concrete will lead to the elimination of the
              need for diagonal reinforcement in coupling beams, while improving their
              seismic performance. Analytical models will be developed to simulate the
              response of fiber reinforced coupling beams under earthquake loading.
