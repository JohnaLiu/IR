Abstract    :
              0001634
The objective of the research is to define and conduct experiments on
              thin walled polymer matrix composite (PMC) tubular specimens having continuous
              reinforcement fibers at methodology for the class of  long or continuous fiber
              PMC. An anisotropic, damaging, non-linear viscoelasticity model proposed
              earlier by the principal investigators is used to represent the deformation and
              failure behavior of the PMC composites.  The experiments are exploratory and
              designed to test fundamental features of the macro-mechanical constitutive
              model, particularly the representation of strong anisotropy, and to guide
              further theoretical development.
