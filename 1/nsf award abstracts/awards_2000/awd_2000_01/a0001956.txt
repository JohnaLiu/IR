Abstract    :
              An integrated multi-institutional effort of multi-scale seismic imaging of the
              Mariana Subduction Factory (MSF). The PIs will conduct multi-channel seismic
              reflection profiling, controlled-source wide-angle reflection/refraction
              profiling and passive recording of local and teleseismic earthquakes through
              OBS deployment to be carried out with Japanese investigators. The data will
              provide a comprehensive velocity and attenuation, structural and stratigraphic
              image of the MSF. The principal objectives of the study are to understand: 1)
              velocity and attenuation structure of the mantle, 2) large-scale flow of the
              mantle wedge, 3) velocity structure of the subducting oceanic crust, 4) seismic
              stratigraphy and structure of the forearc, arc and remnant arc, 5) the magma
              chamber below the volcanoes, 6) a possible double seismic zone, and 7) updip an
              downdip limits of the seismogenic zone. The study will also help in the
              planning and eventual drilling in the Mariana island arc system.
