Abstract    :
              This research consists of two research projects in financial economics.  The
              first project inves-tigates the role of competition in financial markets.  In
              spite of the general acceptance of the competitive mechanism as an allocation
              scheme, many observers consider fi-nancial intermediation an exception.
              Competition is presumed to lead to a "race to the bottom," in which financial
              intermediaries settle for excessively low levels of contractual guarantees in
              an attempt to increase volume. This project develops the-oretical models of
              competition among financial intermediaries that design contracts to attract
              trading volume, while taking into consideration that traders may choose to
              default, and that traders differ in credit quality. These theoretical models
              are used to evaluate arguments for regulation of financial markets, and, in
              particular, whether competition leads to excessively low levels of contractual
              guarantees.  The second project studies the valuation of certain derivative
              securities when short-selling restrictions are present, such as in executive
              stock options.
