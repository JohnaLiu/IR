Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to increase the lifetime of mammalian cells in
              culture by limiting apoptosis through genetic engineering.  Specifically,
              anti-apoptosis genes will be modified to prevent their degradation in culture. 
              The rationale is that much mammalian cell death in bioreactors is apoptotic and
              therefore represents a mechanism for increasing culture lifetimes.  This would
              reduce productivity costs and make cell culture processes feasible for a larger
              number of products.  This project will develop stable inhibitors for apoptosis
              for a wide range of mammalian hosts such as Chinese Hamster Ovary and Baby
              Hamster Kidney cell lines.
