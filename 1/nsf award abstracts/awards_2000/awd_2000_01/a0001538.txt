This project examines the impact of
              indigenous resource management on the creation and maintenance of rainforest
              diversity in the Peruvian Amazon. The researcher will analyze the range of
              variation in agricultural practices among three Ese'eja communities, and
              measure the impact of different types of agricultural practices on tree species
              diversity in the primary forest. Methods include botanical transects,
              ecological analysis, and ethnography.  The project will document how variation
              in agricultural practices across communities (the human impact) causes
              identifiable variability in the number and richness of tree species. The
              research will contribute to our understanding of the human ecology of
              rainforest communities.
