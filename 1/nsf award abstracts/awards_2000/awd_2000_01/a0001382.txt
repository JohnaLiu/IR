Abstract    :
              An SGER award will support development of a novel scanning capacitance
              measurement technique for lubricant film thickness mapping on engineering
              surfaces.  It is expected that this technique will allow non-destructive
              mapping of variations in lubricant thickness as small as 0.1 nm and with a
              nanoscale lateral resolution.  Existing techniques allow measurements only with
              a microscale lateral resolution.  The proposed technique is of great interest
              in applications where lubricant films of mono-molecular thickness are used.  It
              is expected that the proposed technique, if successful, can be developed for
              quality control purposes for the $ 100 billion per year magnetic storage
              industry, the emerging microdevices industry, and other applications using
              ultra-thin films.  An existing AFM will be adapted with a scanning capacitance
              microscopy module, which will be modified to operate with a sharp, conducting
              probe.  The measurements, as envisioned, will consist of an initial
              conventional AFM topography scan of the metal surface, followed by a scan in
              the same track but in the capacitance mode and with the tip at 100 nm height
              above the metal surface, as controlled by input from the topography scan.
