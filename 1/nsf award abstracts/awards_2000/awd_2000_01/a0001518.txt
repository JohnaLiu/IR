Vessels and tanks interconnected with pipes are
              the current construction paradigm in the chemical process industries.  For many
              applications, similar processing can be achieved by narrow-gap architecture
              scaled up through the use of banks and modules.  The PI plans to look at the
              narrow-gap approach, which is a massively parallel and modular approach to
              chemical process construction.  For this method, unit operations, including
              reactors, separation processes, mixing, and electrochemical processes are
              designed in architectures comprised of plates and gaskets fastened
              face-to-face.  Mass transport for a unit operation or between unit operations
              is distributed evenly through the plates and generally in a direction normal to
              the faces of the plates.  Multiple design degrees of freedom are set by the
              architecture of the plates and gaskets - resolving flow patterns, residence
              time distributions, heat transfer processes, and disengaging processes.

The
              goals of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research program are to: (1)
              construct a working module demonstrating the concept and illustrating the
              narrow-gap approach as superior to traditional process architecture, and (2)
              evaluate and develop processes unique to the architecture such as porous-media
              based plug flow reactors, membrane integration, and fluid flow networking.  To
              demonstrate the method, the narrow-gap module architecture will be applied to
              the water-gas shift reaction.
