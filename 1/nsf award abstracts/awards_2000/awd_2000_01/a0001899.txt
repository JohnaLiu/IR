Abstract    :
              The investigators will  create a solar wind parameterized global auroral
              conductance model based on a series of multi-year, multi-season, collaborative
              experiments between the POLAR satellite ultraviolet imager and the Sondrestrom
              incoherent scatter radar.  Auroral conductance is a critically underdetermined
              parameter that is central to a broader understanding of the structure of
              magnetospherically imposed currents, convection potential, and energy
              deposition in the high latitude ionosphere.  The aim is to merge incoherent
              scatter radar conductance measurements with conductance estimates from
              ultraviolet images in a single model that takes advantage of the complementary
              information available from the two techniques.  Modern electrodynamics models
              of the global ionosphere require an accurate specification of auroral energy
              deposition and the associated electrical conductance at high latitudes.  This
              study addresses the weakness of current conductance models by creating a model
              tied to properties of the solar wind.  The final output of the study will be
              solar wind parameterized global conductance maps at the best possible spatial
              resolution.
