Abstract    :
              	Biomass burning is a major source for atmospheric pollution over southern
              Africa as well as globally. Biomass burning emits a large variety of gaseous
              and particulate compounds with significant implications to atmospheric and
              biogeochemical cycles. This collaborative research project with William Keene,
              University of Virginia, is a laboratory investigation of biomass burning in the
              Max Planck Institute for Chemistry experimental fire facility.  The biofuels to
              be studied will be collected by collaborating SAFARI-2000 investigators during
              the dry season of 2000 in three regions of southern Africa that are
              representative for major ecosystem types: The Etosha National Park in northern
              Namibia, the Kruger National Park in north-east South Africa and woodland sites
              in Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Mozambique (the Miombo Network).
   
              The experiments provide a partially controlled burning environment and will be
              used to measure major exhaust species (CO2; CO; CH3Cl, CH3Br, CH3I; NOx; N2O;
              CH4; NH3; HCl, HNO3; SO2, HCOOH, CH3COOH; alkaline-reactive, volatile Cl, Br
              and I; the ionic composition of particles including chloride, bromide, nitrate,
              sulfate, formic and acetic acid; and the elemental composition of particles
              including C, N, Cl, Br, I, S) as well as the elemental content of both biofuels
              and ash-residues. The results of this study will be integrated with those from
              other SAFARI-2000 investigators to model regional biomass burning emissions of
              halogen-, nitrogen-, sulfur-, carbon-containing compounds.
