Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Population Biology
              and is entitled "Genetic Variation Among Populations of Amphibians and Reptiles
              from the Caribbean Island of Puerto Rico".  This research is a phylogeographic
              study of ten species of reptiles and amphibians endemic to the Carribbean
              island bank of Puerto Rico.  Phylogeography consists of the principles and
              processes that govern the geographical distribution of genealogical lineages,
              especially those at the intraspecific level.  Comparative mitochondrial DNA
              phylogeographic studies of the selected reptilian and amphibian species are
              being conducted in order to determine whether their current genetic structure
              has been predominantly influenced by older geological events and climatic
              changes versus more recent phenomena.
