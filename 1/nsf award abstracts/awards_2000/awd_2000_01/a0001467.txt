This project will investigate the social construction of
              race, ethnicity, and nationhood in the US Territory of Guam. The researcher
              will analyze how the indigenous Chamorro incorporate, negotiate, and resist
              colonial discourses in their current struggles to define their political
              identity vis a vis the United States. It will also analyze how "race" figures
              within this political identity and struggle. The three decolonization "task
              forces" that represent major political positions on the island will be the
              focus of the project. Methods include participant observation, structured
              interviewing, linguistic analysis of the talk and narrative of political
              activists, and social network analysis. An analysis of the written material of
              the activists will be used to reconstruct how identity is negotiated and
              "racialized" in this context. This project will contribute to our understanding
              of identity (including race) construction and political activism in the
              postcolonial world.
