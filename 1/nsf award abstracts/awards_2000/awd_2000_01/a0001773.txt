Abstract    :
              This study focuses on attorneys, both U.S. and non-U.S. nationals, engaged in
              the overseas practice of American securities law.  The research has multiple
              objectives.  One is to develop the study of regulatory lawyering across
              different types of regulatory agencies.  A second objective is to generate new
              evidence of how American law is understood and practiced by attorney overseas. 
              A third objective is to build on existing literature regarding process of
              corporate regulatory decisionmaking.

Data will be collected through
              approximately 150 interviews with attorneys in law firms, corporate general
              counsel, and corporate and government officials.  These interviews will include
              a representative sample of both American and British lawyers practicing law in
              London.  The research also includes a survey of securities practitioners and
              general counsel in both countries.
