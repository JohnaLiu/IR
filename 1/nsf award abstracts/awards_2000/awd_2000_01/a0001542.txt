Abstract    :
              The PI will investigate cellular automata self-replication programming, to pave
              the way for more complex studies of this subject in the future.   In
              preliminary work, the PI has been able to construct systems where
              self-replicating structures emerge in a randomly initialized space, and also
              systems where self-replicating structures can solve a restricted version of the
              satisfiability (SAT) problem.   Both models take advantage of the massively
              parallel nature of the underlying cellular automata space within which
              structures replicate and evolve.  This has led the PI to conjecture that
              self-replication programming may constitute a new paradigm for developing
              massively parallel algorithms to solve computationally expensive problems. 
              With this long term goal in mind, the PI will study during the coming year two
              relatively easier subgoals:  the design of compact self-replicating structures
              where more data for computation can be stored in the same size cellular space
              than currently possible, and new bisexual self-replicating models that
              incorporate the crossover operator from genetic algorithms.   To provide the
              requisite testbed for this work, the PI will utilize the Java Virtual Machine
              to extend his high level Trend cellular automata programming language and
              simulation environment to a variety of computer platforms.
