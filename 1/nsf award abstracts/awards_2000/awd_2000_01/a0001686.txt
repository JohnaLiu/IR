Diversity and activities of resident soil microorganisms:
              Effects on soilborne plant pathogenic fungi

Soil contains by far the largest
              biological diversity of all terrestrial ecosystems. However, this diversity is
              poorly quantified, and its relationship to ecosystem functioning is not well
              understood. In this project, the investigator proposes to examine the
              relationships between the diversity and activities of soil microorganisms and
              stability of soil biological systems. Stability of soil biosystems will be
              measured by assessing activities of two plant pathogenic fungi, Pythium ultimum
              and Rhizoctonia solani. Two major questions guide this research: 1) Do high
              activities and diversity of soil microorganisms reduce activities of root
              pathogens? 2) Does the increase of diversity and activities of soil
              microorganisms enhance the resistance of soil biosystems to introduced
              pathogens? This study will advance our understanding of the relationship
              between soil diversity and the stability of soil biosystems. Knowledge of the
              effects of soil microorganisms on plant pathogens will also help us design
              better practices that reduce crop damage caused by these pathogens in
              sustainable agricultural systems.
