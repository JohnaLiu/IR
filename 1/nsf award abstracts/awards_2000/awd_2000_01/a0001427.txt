Abstract    :
              
The proposal deals with investigation of multi-stress accelerated aging of
              polymeric insulators (silicone rubber) and coatings.  It concentrates on field
              lab experiments on aged silicone conductors. This is basically field data
              acquisition with some post-test material analysis. 

This proposal nicely
              outlines research on polymeric insulators to model various aging affects. It
              builds on previously sponsored NSF work and includes some impressive results
              from that work. Through various diagrams and tables it lays out the problem and
              the proposed research approach. 
 
Although the proposed work is somewhat
              incremental and empirical, this is a promising area.
