This
              Small Grant for Exploratory Research supports the principal investigator's
              survey of an important collection of newly declassified documents recently
              released to England's Public Record Office. The newly available documents
              relate to Allied codebreaking in World War II, and to the path-breaking
              computer and information management projects tied to those cryptanalytic
              projects. Through these projects scientists and scientific institutions played
              a major role in the creation of advanced technology and methods. Among the many
              important scientists and institutions associated with the efforts were Alan
              Turing and Vannevar Bush and MIT and Cambridge University.

With the support
              of this grant the PI will secure copies of the more important items and prepare
              articles to alert the historical community of the importance of the new
              collection. The PI will also create an Internet site that will contain indexed
              and annotated copies of the documents.
