Abstract    :
              0001700  Barlaz  The objective of this research is to study factors that control
              the fate and bioavailability of tetrachloroethene (PCE) and toluene in
              landfills with a specific focus on contaminant sequestration and biodegradation
              as influenced by the presence of humic substances in solid matrices, and
              acidogenic and methanogenic leachate.  The specific objectives are to: (1)
              estimate the distribution of sorbed contaminants in solid waste by measuring
              the sorptive capacity of the dominant organic waste components in both fresh
              and biodegraded form, (2) determine whether contaminant sorption is reduced as
              a result of contaminant binding by dissolved organic macromolecules in landfill
              leachate, (3) determine the impacts of aging and leachate composition on
              contaminant desorption rates, (4) identify relationships between chemical and
              physical changes in the decomposing sorbent matrix and the bioavailability and
              sequestration of PCE and toluene, (5) compare rates of desorption and
              biodegradation of fresh and aged contaminants to determine whether desorption
              limits bioavailability, and (6) identify whether covalent and/or noncovalent
              associations with humic materials are important for the sequestration of PCE
              and toluene in the solid waste.  This research will provide information on how
              contaminants may be expected to behave in landfills over long periods of time
              and will support the development of models to predict contaminant fate in
              landfills. ***
