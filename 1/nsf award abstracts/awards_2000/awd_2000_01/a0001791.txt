Abstract    :
              This award provides support for a Gordon Research Conference on the theoretical
              foundations of product design and manufactureability.  The conference will be
              held at Plymouth State College in Plymouth, New Hampshire, June 11-16, 2000. 
              It will bring together experts from the fields of engineering design,
              manufacturing, mathematics, economics, and decision theory.  The conference
              format consists of morning and evening sessions, with afternoons free for small
              group discussions and poster sessions.  In each of the formal sessions, a few
              brief position papers will be presented, and these will be followed by open
              discussion.  Topics of discussion will include: the state of the art, the role
              of creativity in design, the role of decision theory in design, the role of
              mathematical representation and optimization in design, validation of design
              methods, implementation of design theory and design tools, integration
              engineering, and distributed design.
