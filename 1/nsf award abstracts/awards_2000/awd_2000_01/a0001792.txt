Abstract    :
              This is funding to subsidize travel and housing expenses of students attending
              the 6th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Design, to be
              held June 26-29, 2000, at WPI.  Design is an important research topic in
              engineering and architecture.  It is the key to economic competitiveness and
              the fundamental precursor to manufacturing.  However, our understanding of
              design as a process and our ability to model it are still very limited.  This
              conference series aims to provide an international forum for the presentation
              and discussion of state-of-the-art, cutting edge research and developments in
              artificial intelligence in design.  Held every two years, this conference is
              the premier one in the field, attracting about 150 participants from over 10
              different countries.  The current funding will provide up to 50% travel support
              for student attendees, and will afford them an important opportunity to present
              their research, to hear about the latest results and research thrusts, and to
              interact with peers in the international, interdisciplinary AI-in-Design
              community.
