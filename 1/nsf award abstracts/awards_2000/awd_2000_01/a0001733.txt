Abstract    :
              
This is a study of the efforts of Iranian women to advance the rights of women
              and children through the legal system. The research explores the ways Iranian
              women have been able to use principles of Islam and Islamic courts to contest
              oppression under an Islamic regime.   This project focuses specifically on
              child custody issues through a case study of Iran's Organization for the
              Defense of Children's Rights (ODOR), a Non-Governmental Organization under the
              UN. In part this project is a case study of a significant trial which resulted
              in altering Iran's custody laws in favor of children and mothers in 1997. The
              tactics used by the reform-oriented litigants are examined through interviews
              and analysis of important documents. The second phase of this research focuses
              on participant observation in the organization's current activities.  The
              theory-building objectives of this project include: Adding to knowledge about
              resistance to legal demands; Increasing understanding of Islamic feminism; and
              advancing understanding of the globalization of human rights discourse.
