The
              terrain conditions, as well as the strong diurnal heating/cooling cycles
              experienced in the southwest region of the US, can lead to significant
              pollution concentrations.  Understanding the natural atmospheric flows that are
              associated with the interplay of the terrain and the buoyancy effects is a
              prerequisite to mitigating the harmful effects of
              automotive/industrial/domestic sources of released pollutants.  It is expected
              that this integrated study: laboratory experiments, theoretical modeling, and
              field experiments, will lead to the enhanced understanding that may permit
              controlled actions to lessen the effects of the pollutants.  It is also
              expected that this investigation will show the benefits of such a
              well-coordinated investigation and that future studies will benefit from the
              evolved methodology.
