This is a collaborative (University of Maryland
              and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory), multidisciplinary project designed to
              further test the possibility of core-mantle interaction. It will utilize a
              combination of isotope geochemistry and experimental petrology/geophysics.
              Specific objectives are to: 1) Precisely measure the 186Os-187Os systematics of
              two carefully chosen plume-derived systems, and assess if there is a positive
              relation between 186Os and 187Os enrichment. 2) Begin a search for isotopic
              anomalies in the short lived 107Pd-107Ag, 182Hf-182W, 98Tc-98Ru and 97Tc-97Mo
              systems in the plume derived rocks for which the 186Os-187Os evidence suggests
              the presence of a core component. 3) Begin experimental work to examine the
              metal-silicate partitioning behaviors of Pt, Re, Os, Hf, W, Pd, Ag, Mo, Tc and
              Ru between silicate and metal at high pressures. The goal of this research is
              to generate a substrate of data on which to make predictive models of the
              behaviors of the isotope systems composed of these elements resulting from core
              segregation in both metal and silicate reservoirs. 4) Measure FeO solubility in
              liquid Fe alloy at high pressure to evaluate the potential for recovery of core
              geochemical signals by transferring material from the core to the mantle by
              exsolution.
