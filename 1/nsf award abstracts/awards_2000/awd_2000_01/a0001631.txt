	This award provides three years of funding support to the PI
              and his team for the purpose of (1) improving the software documentation and
              user interfaces for earth scientists using Global Positioning System (GPS) data
              for precise position measurements, (2) providing interactive, Web-based time
              series data from global analyses that can be used by individual GPS researchers
              to assess the quality of their own analysis of GPS data, (3) training new and
              experienced GPS researchers in state-of-the-art processing strategies, and (4)
              assisting GPS researchers with data analysis problems.
