Abstract    :
              This proposal supports travel and lodging at a conference to be held in Honolulu
              June 23 - 25, 2000.  It permits five or six advanced graduate students in
              Sociology from PI's institutuion (UCLA) to attend the first international
              conference on mathematical sociology.  Co-sponsors are the American
              Sociological Association's Section on Mathematical Sociology and the Japanese
              Association for Mathematical Sociology.

In addition to the usual
              intellectual and professional benefits to students from attending a conference,
              this one presents several unique opportunities.  Japanese sociologists have
              developed a considerable body of theoretical literature in mathematical
              sociology, published in Japanese journals.  Most of that work remainis
              un-translated and unavailable in the West, so it is only through personal
              meetings such as conferences that American students can be exposed to this
              work.  The conference also will foster international contacts that we hope will
              lead to future collaborations, exchanges, and employment opportunities for the
              students involved.
