Abstract    :
              This project will apply phase-space reconstruction techniques to ground-based
              magnetometer data and data from a number of spacecraft in the solar wind in
              within the magnetosphere to predict important space weather indices such as AL
              and Dst.  The project will also investigate the possibility of using critical
              behavior (in particular self-organized criticality) as a complement to current
              space weather forecasting tools.
