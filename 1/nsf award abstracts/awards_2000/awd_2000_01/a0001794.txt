The focus of the
              proposed workshop to be held at Michigan State University is to identify
              barriers that prevent from CFD from being more useful in the design and
              analysis of automotive components and systems.  Three panels will be invited to
              speak at the workshop, one academic and two industrial.  The academic panel
              will consists of leading CFD researchers.  The industrial panels will consists
              of CFD experts and managers from the Big Three (DaimlerChrysler, Ford and
              General Motors) and representatives from the major CFD commercial code
              companies (Adapco, AEA, ANSYS, AVL and FLUENT).  

The workshop will be held
              on June 14-16, 2000 at the University Faculty Club in East Lansing, Michigan.
