This project will investigate the construction of Irish
              Catholic identity among Irish teens, and how it socially maintained in
              opposition to "Protestant" and "British" identities. Focusing on differences
              between the youth generation and their parents, the researcher will examine two
              areas of identity construction: personal appearance and social construction of
              space. The research will test the hypothesis that differences in these aspects
              of identity expression reflect key differences in how each generation perceives
              "traditional" Irish Catholic culture. Youth may be renegotiating Catholic
              identity by incorporating various elements of pop culture. Methods include
              participant observation in a Catholic housing estate outside of Belfast,
              structured interviews with samples of Catholic teens, adults, and youth
              workers, oral histories, and photo interviews. This project will contribute to
              our understanding of theories of identity construction in adolescence.
