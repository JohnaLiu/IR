SGER:  The Digital
              Perspective Project

The Digital Perspective Project is an attempt to use
              discrete models for a wide variety of physical phenomena.  In contrast to
              continuous analytic models, such as differential equations, discrete models
              offer understanding of phenomena that are discrete, or quantized at the
              microscopic level.  These phenomena include electric charge, light, genetics,
              and some mechanical phenomena such as vibration.  Early work in this field has
              shown that purely digital models such as cellular automata can conserve the
              digital values of physical quantities exactly.

The work to be done under
              this project combines a seminar at Carnegie Mellon University with a series of
              public lectures.  Researchers from around the world who have made contributions
              to discrete models in several areas will participate in both activities. 
              Distinguished Lectures will be presented in both Pittsburgh and Washington, and
              will be made available on the World Wide Web.  The seminar and lectures will
              provide a spur for the further development of discrete models of physical
              phenomena.
