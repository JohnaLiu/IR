Large Eddy Simulation (LES) represents an important
              bridge between basic turbulence research and computational efforts in
              engineering (CFD).  The basic elements of LES are clearly in an evolutionary
              stage and the Optimal LES (OLES) of the UIUC research group is a most important
              component of the broad based effort to develop this methodology.

The present
              award will continue the development of OLES and permit it to be a strategy by
              which LES can contribute to our fundamental understandings of, as well as our
              ability to simulate, turbulent flows.
