Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Behavioral
              Neuroscience and is entitled "The Role of Neurocalcin and Calcium Binding in
              Development of the Zebra Finch Telencephalon."  Although some masculinization
              during development is frequently mediated by testicular secretions
              (testosterone and its metabolite, estradiol), other sexual dimorphisms, or
              variances between sexes, cannot be explained by the actions of steroids.  For
              example, application of estradiol has been shown to only partially masculinize
              the brain of the female Zebra finch.  In the Zebra finch species, the male
              telencephalon (the area of the brain that controls song) is markedly larger
              than that of the female.  It is hypothesized that genetic rather than hormonal
              mechanisms also induce this dimorphism.  In particular, this study examines the
              developing female Zebra Finch brain and the role of neurocalcin (a calcium
              binding protein) on neuronal development. Expression of neurocalcin in the
              female brain has been shown via amplification of RNA.  Northern blot analysis,
              which identifies presence of RNA and thus gene expression, is being used to
              determine the time-course of neurocalcin expression throughout the entire
              period of sexual differentiation, and in-situ hybridization demonstrates its
              localized expression.  Finally, calcium imaging is used to investigate the
              potential sex differences as a function of free calcium, which might be induced
              by increased neurocalcin in females.
