It is proposed to bring the
              Arizona State University portion of the Center for the Advanced Control of
              Energy and Power Systems (ACEPS) into the Power Systems Engineering Research
              Center (Pserc).  Both these efforts focus on research in electric power
              engineering.  The ASU portion of ACEPS will bring expertise to Pserc in the
              areas of electric power quality, high voltage engineering, and power
              electronics.  These areas are believed to beneficially supplement the existing
              Pserc power engineering efforts.  Additionally, ASU-ACEPS will bring expertise
              in power system instrumentation and control, and power system analysis. 
              

The combined center is expected to be one of the largest power engineering
              efforts in the world, focusing on questions of power systems, deregulation of
              the power industry, power quality, transmission and distribution , and the
              efficient use of power infrastructure.  An educational component of the program
              is proposed in the form of graduate and undergraduate student training and
              research and bringing advanced concepts in power engineering into the
              undergraduate classroom
