Abstract    :
              The award is for a collaborative study involving the Universities of Colorado,
              Oregon, Washington, and Alaska, aimed at improving the understanding of the
              characteristics, mechanisms, and feedback processes associated with changes in
              vegetation, sea level, and standing surface water in Beringia during the last
              21,000 years, and to use this understanding to aid in the development of
              predictive tools for future pan-Arctic climate change. The specific research
              objectives and tasks are based on refining a modeling strategy for simulating
              regional paleoclimatic variations and for diagnosing the interactions between
              different components of the climate system, utilizing global and regional
              climate models and an equilibrium vegetation simulation model. Simulations will
              be performed at key times, compared to observational data, and diagnosed to
              understand potential feedbacks.
