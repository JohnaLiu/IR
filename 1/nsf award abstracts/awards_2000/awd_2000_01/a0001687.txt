Abstract    :
              The investigators will study the relationship between Pi2 waves detected by
              ground-based magnetometers and magnetospheric substorm occurrence.  Pi2 waves
              are routinely detected by ground magnetometers located at low- to mid-latitudes
              and their general association with substorms is well recognized.  However,
              further analysis of Pi2 waves is required in order to make the phenomenon a
              more reliable tool for space weather specification and prediction.  Physical
              parameters of Pi2 waves observed at multiple stations can be used to monitor
              the spatial and temporal development of substorms during the expansion and
              recovery phases.  The investigators will quantitatively evaluate the capability
              of the Pi2 waves for monitoring substorm activity.  They will use auroral
              images from the Polar satellite to identify the time and location of substorm
              onsets to compare with Pi2 waves detected on the ground.  The results will lead
              to a better understanding of substorms and to the development of a technique to
              remotely sense the time and location of substorms.
