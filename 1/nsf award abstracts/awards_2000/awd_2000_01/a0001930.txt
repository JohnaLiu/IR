Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to understand the role of growth factors and
              bioreactor design on the in vitro culture of hematopoietic tissues, with a goal
              of producing cells outside of the body for use in bone marrow reconstruction
              and gene therapy.  The Principal Investigators (PIs) propose a technique to
              increase 
the expansion (division) of stem cells ex vivo.  Stem cells are
              typically found in the bone marrow, and after differentiation are responsible
              for creation of mature blood cells (hematopoiesis).  The PIs hypothesize that
              membrane bound stem cell factor (bSCF) will result in enhanced stem cell
              renewal ex vivo, and that will 
occur because bSCF (and associated receptor,
              c-kit) will not be internalized by the stem cells.  There are four specific
              aims to test this hypothesis which include: (1) covalently bind SCF to a
              non-cell-adhesive polymer support; (2) study the effect of bSCF and soluble SCF
              (sSCF) on model cells, the human-cytokine-dependent cell line M07e; (3) model
              the growth of M07e cells (with bSCF and sSCF) to determine growth/death rates,
              
and the fraction of c-kit receptors occupied by SCF, and (4) repeat these
              steps with human stem cells removed from cancer patients.
