This project will investigate the factors behind the failure
              of participatory development programs in Suduwarura Ara Gama, a small,
              impoverished village in southeastern Sri Lanka. Previous research suggests that
              villagers, although originally enthusiastic, have become increasingly critical
              of development efforts (in agriculture, irrigation, handloom factories,
              schools). At the same time, they are unable to articulate their own development
              goals. The researcher hypothesizes that specific development agendas are
              formulated by villagers in their interaction with local, state, and
              international development agencies, and that this process may result in limited
              consideration of development alternatives. In this village restudy, the
              research will focus on the nature of this interaction. Methods include
              structured interviews, collection of oral histories of development and village
              improvement, focus groups and formal opinion surveys. This project will
              contribute to our understanding of how rural populations in the developing
              world shape their own development agendas and perceptions, a critical factor in
              the ultimate success or failure of participatory development initiatives.
