That feedbacks potentially exist between climate
              change, erosion, and crustal deformation has focused attention on the
              topography of active orogenic systems.  Studies of linkages between
              deformation, denudation and topographic development are complex, and have
              primarily utilized fluvial rather than glacial systems.  Glaciated regions have
              a characteristic topographic form that is distinct from that of fluvial
              terrains, however basic relationships such as how mean topography relates with
              patterns of rock uplift are essentially unknown for landscapes dominated by
              glacial erosion.  This project will investigate the long-term consequences of
              glacial erosion for topography, exhumation and deformation by study of the
              Chugach/St. Elias Range, Alaska, an actively deforming glaciated orogenic belt.
               Results will enable testes of how deformation and glaciation have influenced
              orogenic topography over the last few million years.  A better understanding of
              the role of glaciers in mountain system will provide a more complete context
              for the analysis of ancient collisional belts in the rock record.
