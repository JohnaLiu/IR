The PI proposes to conduct a three-year research
              program to develop a short-term forecasting capability that can predict the
              occurrence of equatorial spread F (ESF).  SRI proposes to augment the cluster
              of sensors at the Pohnpei Radar Observatory (PRO) with an oblique-incidence
              backscatter (OIB) sounding capability so that the PRO can be used to collect
              the much-needed simultaneous measurements of electric field and plasma-density
              distribution.  The PRO already houses a 50 MHz backscatter radar, a
              frequency-agile radar (FAR), and a magnetometer; all are capable of
              contributing estimates of the equatorial electric field at different (but
              overlapping) times of the day.  The OIB sounder would provide a description of
              the plasma-density distribution in both hemispheres.  With this set of sensors,
              the PRO would become an ideal prototype for an integrated, ESF space-weather
              monitoring station.  SRI envisions the proposed research to be a synergistic
              one that will enable physics-based models to be run with critical data sets,
              and data to be properly interpreted with the assistance of model outputs.
