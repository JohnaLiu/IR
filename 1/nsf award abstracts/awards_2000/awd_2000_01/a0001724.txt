Abstract    :
              The proposed research consists of two parts of roughly equal magnitude.  The
              first part is a theoretical econometric project on instrumental variables, or
              GMM, estimation.  The aim is to derive theoretical results on estimators that
              achieve, or approximately achieve, certain efficiency bounds.  Simulations will
              be used to establish the finite sample performance of the estimators.
The
              second project is an empirical macroeconomic study of interest rates and
              exchange rates in Asian countries affected by the recent financial crises.  A
              model that includes a monetary policy rule in the form of an interest rate
              reaction function will be developed and estimated using the empirical
              techniques developed in the first part of this proposal.  A key question is how
              policy-induced interest rate movements affect exchange rates, risk premia, and,
              more generally, the economy as a whole.
