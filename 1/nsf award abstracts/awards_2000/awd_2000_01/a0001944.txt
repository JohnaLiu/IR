Abstract    :
              Recommended project is for a multidisciplinary investigation of the thermal
              state of the subducting lithosphere offshore of the Costa Rica margin.  Heat
              flow measurements will be undertaken in two cruises covering oceanic
              lithosphere portions offshore of the Nicoya Peninsula that differ in makeup and
              tectonic style, with the northern portion formed at the East Pacific Rise and
              the southern portion, separated by an abrupt change in relief, formed at the
              Cocos-Nazca spreading center.  These measurements will be acompanied by seismic
              and swath bathymmetric study, as well as a coring program that will examine
              changes in porewater chemistry associated with fluid flow in the sediments
              overlying the crust.  These field programs will be accompanied by two numerical
              modeling exercises that will examine the thermal state of the subduction zone
              as these two portions of lithosphere subduct.  The goals will be to determine
              the comparative thermal state of the subducting lithosphere in these regions,
              the associated heat and fluid fluxes responsible for the subducting slab
              thermal states, and how these variables affect subduction zone processes,
              including chemical flux rates.
