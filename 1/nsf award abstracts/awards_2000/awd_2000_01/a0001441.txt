The accurate quantitative evaluation of transverse
              dispersion is crucial in hydrogeology, environmental engineering, and other
              fields because of the way this process affects solute dilution and mixing of
              reactants.  In many cases, the rate of biochemical reactions depends on the
              transverse dispersion coefficient.  The primary objective of this research is
              to develop and test a new laboratory method for measuring transverse
              dispersion.      Although there are methods for the laboratory measurement of
              transverse dispersion in porous media they all are based on the concept of
              measuring this quantity directly, which is very difficult because transverse
              dispersion coefficients are small.  The proposed method is based on the
              inference of transverse dispersion from measurements of a quantity is inversely
              proportional to it. This work will develop and test a device for measurement of
              the transverse dispersion in homogeneous isotopic porous media.  We will
              measure the Taylor dispersion coefficient in a spiral flow field.   A small
              transverse dispersion means a large Taylor dispersion coefficient that is easy
              to infer with satisfactory accuracy from the breakthrough curve.  The flow and
              transport in the device will be evaluated through experiments and mathematical
              modeling.  Additionally, we will perform experiments with several
              unconsolidated porous media in order to evaluate the behavior of dispersivity
              with grain size and distribution, type of packing, and other variable.
