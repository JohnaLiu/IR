              ABSTRACT

Six estuarine biogeochemists will be selected from the scientific
              community to participate in the Sixth International Symposium of Model
              Estuaries.  The primary purpose of this symposium series is to bring together
              estuarine biogeochemists from around the world to exchange results of research
              on disparate system will be to discuss present-day knowledge on the impact of
              the largest deltas in the world on the coastal invironment, taking into
              consideration both terrestrial areas and coastal waters.  Each participant will
              present a paper that will be published in a special edition of Marine
              Chemistry.
