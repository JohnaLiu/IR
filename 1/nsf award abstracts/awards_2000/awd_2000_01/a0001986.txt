Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Biomolecular
              Processes and is entitled "G-protein Regulation of a Volume-Sensitive Anion
              Channel".  This research examines the ability of cells to sense and respond to
              changes in cell volume, a vital housekeeping activity that also serves
              important roles in growth, proliferation, and apoptosis or "programmed cell
              death".  Cell volume homeostasis is mediated primarily by ion channels, or
              Volume-Sensitive Organic Osmolyte Anion Channels (VSOAC), which release
              chloride and other organic osmolytes in response to swelling.  Initial studies
              have demonstrated that these VSOACs are stimulated by G-protein activiation. 
              This research investigates 1. The role of Rho GTPase and cell swelling on VSOAC
              activation, and 2. The role of actin cytoskeleton, the cell's "skeleton" whose
              structure and function are known to be regulated by Rho GTPase.
