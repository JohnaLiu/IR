              project is for a multidisciplinary investigation of the thermal state of the
              subducting lithosphere offshore of the Costa Rica margin.  Heat flow
              measurements will be undertaken in two cruises covering oceanic lithosphere
              portions offshore of the Nicoya Peninsula that differ in makeup and tectonic
              style, with the northern portion formed at the East Pacific Rise and the
              southern portion, separated by an abrupt change in relief, formed at the
              Cocos-Nazca spreading center.  These measurements will be accompanied by
              seismic and swath bathymmetric study, as well as a coring program that will
              examine changes in porewater chemistry associated with fluid flow in the
              sediments overlying the crust.   These field programs will be accompanied by
              two numerical modeling exercises that will examine the thermal state of the
              subduction zone as these two portions of lithosphere subduct.  The goals will
              be to determine the comparative thermal state of the subducting lithosphere in
              these regions, the associated heat and fluid fluxes responsible for the
              subducting slab thermal states, and how these variable affect subduction zone
              processes, including chemical flux rates.
