Abstract    :
              Survivability and secure communications are essential in a mobile
computing
              environment. We propose to conduct a series of experiments
that will lead to
              the development of new authentication and key management
techniques for
              wireless communications. We study the implementation of
various authentication
              schemes on the overall system performance. We
propose a technique to achieve
              fault-tolerant mobile node authentication
in an efficient way. We plan to
              identify guidelines for authentication
between an upstream domain and a
              DiffServ ingress router in a QoS enabled
network. We will evaluate how various
              secure group communication and
access control techniques fit into the wireless
              world by conducting 
scientific experiments in a systematic way. We will solve
              the problem of 
providing secure multimedia communication under mobile
              environments where
the resources available to mobile hosts such as CPU power
              and network
bandwidth are very limited. We have developed a series of
              light-weight
video encryption algorithms which encompass video compression and
              video
encryption in one step. This will lead towards an adaptable
encryption
              system.
