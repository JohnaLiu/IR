This award provides support for the travel of two U.S. graduate
              students and one speaker as participants in the conference Bioartificial
              Organs: Tissue Sourcing, Immuniosolation and Clinical Trials to be held at
              Davos, Switzerland, October 7-11, 2000.
  
The subject matter of the
              Conference relates directly to two important elements of the Biomedical
              Engineering Program: research in the increasingly important field of tissue
              engineering, and  the encouragement of students and young professionals to
              engage in research activities. The meeting will provide the opportunity for the
              participants to meet and confer with world leaders in research directed to the
              development of bioartificial organs as is illustrated by the preliminary
              technical program included in the proposal.

The conference is being
              organized and directed by highly competent individuals who have an enviable
              track record of successes (most recently Bioartificial Organs II, 1998). All
              plenary and invited papers are to be published by the New York Academy of
              Sciences in a book entitled Bioartificial Organs to be edited by the conference
              organizing committee.
