              ATM0001444

The investigators will continue theoretical studies and associated
              computer simulation and modeling of a range of basic solar wind properties and
              their interactions with cosmic rays, including energetic solar particles.  The
              research will include studies of the structure of the interplanetary magnetic
              field and plasma, with particular emphasis on the effect of the field's
              structure on cosmic ray and energetic particle acceleration, propagation and
              anisotropies.  Previous work on the transport and acceleration of cosmic rays
              in the heliosphere has led to the creation of a large library of software for
              the modeling of cosmic ray transport and acceleration.  This library will be
              extended and used to obtain full two- and three-dimensional, time-dependent
              simulations of cosmic ray transport and acceleration.  Mechanisms of particle
              acceleration in interplanetary space, and the effects of energetic particles on
              the dynamics of the solar wind and its termination will be studied.  The
              investigators will improve two-dimensional models to include the dynamical
              effects of galactic and anomalous cosmic rays on the global solar wind, and to
              study time-dependent, transient effects which are expected to be important
              during the current solar maximum.
