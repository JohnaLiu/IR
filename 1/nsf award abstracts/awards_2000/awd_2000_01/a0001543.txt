Abstract    :
              This funding is in support of an HCI research consortium (workshop) of promising
              doctoral students and distinguished research faculty.  The consortium will be
              held in conjunction with the ACM 2000 Conference on Human Factors in Computing
              Systems (CHI 2000), sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's
              Special Interest Group on Human Computer Interaction (SIGCHI).  The goals of
              the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then
              have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of
              new researchers by having experts in the research field give them advice, and
              making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their
              research conference.  Student participants will make formal presentations of
              their work during the workshop, and will receive feedback from the faculty
              panel.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate
              how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction
              research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research
              projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether
              their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Student participants
              will also present their work during the technical program of the CHI 2000
              conference.  Extended abstracts of the students' work will be disseminated via
              publication in the CHI 2000 Extended Abstracts, which has wide print and
              electronic distribution.  Evaluation of the consortium will be conducted by ACM
              SIGCHI's conference management committee, and results of the evaluation will be
              available to the organizers of future consortia.
