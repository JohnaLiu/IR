Abstract    :
                   This award supports a two-year program of experimental studies comparing
              several theoretical perspectives on the choice to cooperate or to behave
              selfishly in a social dilemma situation.  (Social dilemmas occur in cases such
              as public goods, subject to "free riding," or taking advantage of payments by
              others without contributing to the common good.)  Previous research has shown
              that the first decision to cooperate or to defect is very important, usually
              setting a precedent for subsequent behavior in the situation.  Drawing on
              social psychological theories of context and framing, expected utility theories
              or rewards, and prospect theories of anticipated benefit, the PI has formulated
              a set of contrasting hypotheses of principles governing first decisions.  The
              hypotheses will be assessed in laboratory experiments allowing choices between
              contributing to a public good, withholding contribution, or taking from the
              public good without contributing.  Results will be used to develop a
              theoretical understanding of factors influencing first choices.  The theories
              should also have practical implications for many public good situations.
