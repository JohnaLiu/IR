This is a collaborative (University of
              Maryland and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory), multidisciplinary project
              designed to further test the possibility of core-mantle interaction. It will
              utilize a combination of isotope geochemistry and experimental
              petrology/geophysics. Specific objectives are to: 1) Precisely measure the
              186Os-187Os systematics of two carefully chosen plume-derived systems, and
              assess if there is a positive relation between 186Os and 187Os enrichment. 2)
              Begin a search for isotopic anomalies in the short lived 107Pd-107Ag,
              182Hf-182W, 98Tc-98Ru and 97Tc-97Mo systems in the plume derived rocks for
              which the 186Os-187Os evidence suggests the presence of a core component. 3)
              Begin experimental work to examine the metal-silicate partitioning behaviors of
              Pt, Re, Os, Hf, W, Pd, Ag, Mo, Tc and Ru between silicate and metal at high
              pressures. The goal of this research is to generate a substrate of data on
              which to make predictive models of the behaviors of the isotope systems
              composed of these elements resulting from core segregation in both metal and
              silicate reservoirs. 4) Measure FeO solubility in liquid Fe alloy at high
              pressure to evaluate the potential for recovery of core geochemical signals by
              transferring material from the core to the mantle by exsolution.
