Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for
              2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Behavioral
              Neuroscience and is entitled "Regulation of Synaptic Plasticity by
              Subpopulations of NMDA Receptors".  Long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term
              depression (LTD), and depotentiation are persistent and long-lasting changes in
              synaptic function that may underlie the cellular mechanisms for learning and
              memory.  This research examines the function of the NMDA receptor (a
              post-synaptic receptor that induces neuronal firing in glutaminergic neurons)
              in LTP, LTD, and depotentiation.  The role of specific NMDA receptor subunits
              (i.e. components) is assessed in the hippocampus of mice, an area of the brain
              involved in learning and memory.  This is accomplished via use of inhibitory
              chemicals that have binding affinities to specific subunits, as well as by use
              of gene-targeted knockout mice (mice whose genes encoding specific receptor
              subunits have been deleted and therefore do not express them).  In addition, to
              determine if LTD and depotentiation share similar maintenance mechanisms,
              biochemical assays are performed to ascertain shared properties with respect to
              protein kinase C.  This research will broaden current understanding of the
              molecular basis of synaptic plasticity.
