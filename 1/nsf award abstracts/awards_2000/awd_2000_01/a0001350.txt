Abstract    :
              This is funding to subsidize travel and housing expenses of students selected to
              participate in the Student Research Workshop to be held April 29-May 3, 2000 in
              Seattle, Washington during the ANLP/NAACL 2000 joint conference (Applied
              Natural Language Processing and North American Chapter of the Association for
              Computational Linguistics).   The intimate workshop format will  encourage
              student participants to begin building a rapport with established researchers. 
               Students will have sufficient time to present their research (25 minutes) and
              then receive feedback from a panel of established researchers in the field (15
              minutes).   The workshop will provide students with invaluable exposure to
              outside perspectives on their work at a critical time in their research, and
              will also allow them to put their work into perspective based on feedback from
              the panel and from fellow participants.   This nurturing effort should pay
              dividends by more effectively guiding students in this rapidly changing
              research field, and seems to be an inexpensive yet effective means of
              encouraging young and upcoming computational linguists.
