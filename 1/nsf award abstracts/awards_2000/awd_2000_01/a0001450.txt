Abstract    :
              Emperor penguins are a familiar inhabitant of Antarctica yet much of their
              population biology remains unknown due to their winter breeding behavior and
              occupation of colonies in remote areas.  The major goal of this proposal is to
              apply a unique method for determining the population status of emperor penguins
              in the western Ross Sea colonies.  This will involve the assessment of the
              feasibility of satellite imagery for conducting population censuses of emperor
              penguins; and verification of the accuracy of the satellite images analyses by
              on site counts (ground truthing).  The final outcome of this objective will be
              essential information necessary to determine the long-term trend in the
              fledging population of the seven known Ross Sea colonies, as well as the adult
              breeding population determined from the incubating huddles.  Censusing by
              satellite imagery will reduce the logistic problems of field censuses and the
              inherent loss of data because of weather or lack of access during critical
              phases of the life cycle.  Remote sensing will accomplish this task with little
              activity within, and minimal impact on the Antarctic environment.  Also, once
              this method is demonstrated to be financially and technically feasible, then
              the size of all emperor penguin colonies could be measured in this way.  For
              example, some exceptionally remote colonies discovered in the 1960's and 1970's
              have not been visited since the initial contact.  This procedure may provide
              the best and least intrusive method for not only determining the present status
              of those colonies, but for measuring the entire world population of fledged
              young of the year.  Such a direct and comprehensive determination is unique for
              any marine predator.
