Abstract    :
              	The objective of this project is to determine the dynamical mechanisms
              responsible for the poleward propagation of zonal mean flow anomalies, where
              the anomaly is defined as the deviation from the climatological flow.  The
              phenomenon has been identified in both observational and numerical model
              studies.  A recent observational study showed that this phenomenon is
              ubiquitous, appearing in both the summer and winter seasons of the Northern and
              Southern Hemispheres.  There are reasons to suspect this phenomenon may be an
              important part of well-known low-frequency anomalies or teleconnection
              patterns, particularly the so-called Arctic Oscillation.  

	Inspired by a
              recent study on the impact of the Hadley circulation on Rossby wave dynamics,
              Dr. Lee developed a hypothesis for the mechanism that drives the poleward
              propagation.  The essence of the hypothesis is based on the premise that
              anomalous baroclinic wave fluxes drive an anomalous Hadley circulation, and
              this in turn influences the latitude at which subsequent baroclinic wave
              breaking occurs.  The theory of wave-mean flow interaction says that this
              process must alter the meridional distribution of the zonal mean flow change,
              which was initially driven by the eddy fluxes.  This research will explore how
              this process can cause the poleward propagation of the zonal mean flow eddies. 
              The investigation will be done through both observational data analysis and
              numerical modeling experiments.
