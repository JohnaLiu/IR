Abstract    :
              The collaborative research will be guided by two notions based on current
              research on the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO): (a) mechanisms for air-sea
              interaction of the MJO depend on the detailed structure of MJO, and (b) oceanic
              feedback to the MJO should be viewed as a modification of the general role of
              surface latent/sensible heat fluxes in the MJO by SST variation. Following
              these two guidelines, the proposed research will (i) investigate the oceanic
              response and feedback to the MJO in the context of two MJO conceptual models
              based on observations and (ii) explore the oceanic feedback mechanisms within
              the framework of studying the general role of surface heat fluxes in the MJO.
              To achieve a thorough understanding of large-scale physical processes of
              air-sea interaction, the research project will first focus separately on the
              oceanic response and feedback to the MJO, before any attempt of coupling is
              made. The work is important because it will yield insights on the interaction
              between the  MJO and ENSO, this will have implications for better seasonal
              forecasting of ENSO.
