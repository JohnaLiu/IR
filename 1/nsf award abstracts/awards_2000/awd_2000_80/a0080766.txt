Abstract    :
              The goal of this focussed research group (FRG) grant is to create an integrated
              model for all of the steps associated with the metal alloy design process.  The
              approach is an integrated combination of computational and experimental
              materials science among six universities and four national laboratories. The
              selection of Ni-base alloys and alpha/beta Ti alloys as focal points for the
              alloy design is based on the availability of a well developed Ni-base alloy
              data bank that places nickel alloys on a much firmer footing than alpha/beta
              Ti-base alloys.  This allows a useful comparison between the ability to model
              the two alloy systems. The funds requested go almost entirely to student
              support at the participating universities, thereby providing superb educational
              value.  Industry has endorsed the effort with additional support from eight
              companies at $30K/year (and more participation is expected).  The State of Ohio
              will add $500,000 for the first year's funding based on the NSF support.  NSF
              funding is primarily from the Division of Materials Research with participation
              from the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems in the Engineering
              Directorate.

The ultimate goal of this research effort is to produce an
              integrated set of computational tools for the development and optimization of
              new and existing materials to such a degree that its application will replace
              the need for costly experimental testing schedules.  This will permit the
              introduction of new materials that are characterized by an appropriate degree
              of maturity within a framework of reduced cost and time.
