Abstract    :
              Current evolution of semiconductor integrated circuit technology suffers from
              the topological tyranny of requiring all active devices to be in one plane: the
              surface of the single crystal wafer.  Because transistors can now be so small
              (e.g. 18nm channels), the lateral dimension of the crystal needed for one
              transistor is now approaching the dimensions of assemblies of atoms whose
              properties can be computed ab initio and such nanocrystals might well be
              successfully synthesized on suitably prepared surfaces.  As an initial
              experiment we will form islands of nanotemplates on an amorphous substrate,
              such as deposited SiO2, by electron beam patterning of a Langmuir Blodgett film
              with a suitable lattice period.  Then we will explore the translation of these
              templates in single crystal semiconductor islands.  The complementary
              calculations will be to assess the competing forces (on the deposited atoms)
              favoring sites in the periodic template and those favoring sites in the
              underlying amorphous substrate.  Calculations will also be performed to conduct
              molecular design of the LB molecules, as well as to study the chemistry of
              growing epitaxial semiconductor films on ordered molecular monolayers.
