The San Diego State University - Undergraduate
              Mentoring in Environmental Biology project integrates individual research
              experiences, one-on-one mentoring, and group-based cooperative learning to help
              develop students that excel in their pursuit of graduate degrees and careers in
              Environmental Biology. The program will support three cohorts of nine students
              and focuses broadly on "Human Impacts on Biodiversity". Students will travel to
              Alaska or England, and Mexico during their experience. The nine students form
              an Integrated Research Group (IRG), which consists of three learning groups. A
              learning group includes three students, a graduate assistant and a faculty
              mentor. Each learning group's focus coincides with the research program of its
              mentor: Habitat Fragmentation, Biodiversity or Global Climate Change. The IRG
              advances as learning groups share their findings and synthesize knowledge
              across the research foci.

The UMEB project will help students from
              under-represented groups become broadly-trained and highly motivated
              professionals in Environmental Biology, a field currently lacking this
              representation. The research focus on a timely topic will teach students how
              science can help solve societal problems, thus encouraging them to acquire and
              apply a range of scientific skills. In addition, the teaching methodologies and
              organization of the program set a high standard in student training and will be
              disseminated to other educators.
