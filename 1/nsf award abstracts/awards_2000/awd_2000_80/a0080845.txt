Abstract    :
              Interfacial thermal resistance and anomalous thermal diffusion strongly impede
              energy transport in high power, ultra-short pulse laser interactions, producing
              higher peak temperatures than expected from conventional long-time scale
              analyses.  This may consequently enhance or diminish the effectiveness of the
              laser application.  Through a comprehensive computational and experimental
              study, this research will investigate sub-nanosecond thermal transport in
              micro-and nanostructured materials.  Molecular dynamics simulation and
              femtosecond laser experiments will be performed to characterized the two
              phenomena.
	Contemporary exploration of ultra-short length and time scales are
              creating opportunities for new nanotechnology developments.  Future scientific
              progression will inevitably be concerned with the interaction of ultra-short
              time scale lasers and micro- and nanostructured materials, but current research
              in these combined extreme areas is limited.  This project will reveal
              information essential to further advancements  in sub-nanosecond laser
              diagnostics and processing of nanomaterials as well as provide an improved
              understanding of nanoscale thermal engineering.
