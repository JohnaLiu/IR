The goal of this project is
              to develop a methodology based on computational chemistry and mathematical
              programming coupled with computational phase equilibria to design homogeneous
              catalysts that are highly active, selective, and can be readily recovered from
              the reaction mixture.  A model reaction will be the hydroformylation reaction
              catalyzed by rhodium phosphine complexes.  To avoid computationally intensive
              quantum chemical calculations, the PIs plan to screen homogeneous catalysts
              using a neural network model based on selectivity data obtained from data on
              several different ligands.  Catalyst ligand characteristics will be related to
              selectivity.  Through model predictions additional catalysts can be screened
              without using ab initio calculations.  Solvent effects on catalytic reactions
              will also be modeled using several approaches.  The PIs will develop a model
              for predicting distribution coefficients for a fluorous solvent and
              supercritical carbon dioxide.   These efforts will complement experimental work
              currently being carried out in homogeneous catalysis.  This work may lead to an
              improved methodology for catalyst design and accelerate the use of homogeneous
              catalysts in industrial processes.
