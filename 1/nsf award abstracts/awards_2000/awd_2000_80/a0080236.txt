Abstract    :
              The University of Wyoming and the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental
              Laboratory (INEEL) have previously collaborated to research the durability of
              manufactured homes. This research involved subjecting a single-wide
              manufactured home to simulated design lateral loads, analyzing structural
              response and modeling. This project also builds on prior work sponsored by NSF,
              HUD, and the Manufactured Housing Institute (MHI). The project seeks to better
              understand structural response and to predict behavior under loads from
              hazardous winds, the key to providing homeowners higher quality, safety, and
              cost-effectiveness. The previously tested (design lateral load), single-wide
              manufactured home is installed in a remote, high-wind area and a meteorological
              tower provided. Programmed task for this project include: 1) Completion and
              testing of the data acquisition system, 2) Data collection and analysis during
              high wind events, #) Wind force studies and wind tunnel testing, 4) Structural
              analysis and modeling, and 5) Reporting and technology transfer. The results of
              this research can lead to significant savings in annual losses of life and
              property by providing validated information for the development of
              cost-effective building technologies that optimize wind resistance and maintain
              home affordability
