Description:  This award is for support of a cooperative
              project by Dr. James Vary, International Institute for Theoretical and Applied
              Physics, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, Dr. Harry Lee from Argonne National
              Laboratory and a Jordanian team led by Dr. Mahmoud Hasan, Chairman of the
              Physics Department, Applied Science University, Amman, Jordan.   They plan to
              apply the constrained Hartree-Fock method to predict the properties of
              multi-hyperon nuclei at normal and above-normal densities accessible to
              relativistic heavy-ion collisions. 

Scope:  The Applied Science University
              (ASU) of Jordan, the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), and the International
              Institute of Theoretical and Applied Physics (IITAP) at Iowa State University,
              each have unique and complementary strengths needed to achieve the stated
              objective. Students from Iowa State University and the Applied Science
              University will participate and benefit from this collaborative project.  A key
              element of the plan to efficiently carry out this research project is to
              develop and operate a "virtual laboratory" over digital networks to exchange
              research notes, figures and tables, perform calculations, discuss results and
              draft papers for publications.  This proposal meets the INT objective of
              encouraging collaboration by US and foreign scientists in areas of mutual
              benefit.
