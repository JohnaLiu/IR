Abstract    :
              The Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX), a multidisciplinary field experiment was
              conducted from January to March, 1999 over the Indian Ocean.  A follow-up
              requirement of such a multi-platform experiment is to develop an integrated
              database and coherent analysis of various observations that can be utilized by
              different participating groups and future investigators.  The main objective of
              this project is to integrate and analyze the lower troposphere meteorological
              observations taken from different platforms such as ships, aircraft, satellites
              and land-based stations and investigate the role of land-ocean-atmosphere
              interactions on the atmospheric transport of aerosols and gases.

These
              observations will be used to: 1) evaluate and provide a consistent data set of
              boundary layer/meteorological observations, and 2) develop a detailed analysis
              of the role of aerosol-rich land plume and its interaction with the Marine
              Boundary Layer during INDOEX.  This study will have a positive impact on the
              analysis of the various components of INDOEX observations by different groups,
              and will add to our knowledge of the influence of man-made atmospheric chemical
              constituents on the climate of South Asia and the Indian Ocean.
