Abstract    :
              Nearly 3500 civilian deaths and 17,000 injuries occur in residential structure
              fires each year in the U.S. Detachment of the gypsum board fire protection
              membrane is believed to predetermine the failure of light-frame wood
              roof/ceiling assemblies in standardized fires. Identifying the factors
              associated with maintaining the attachment of the gypsum wallboard to the
              supporting wood structural assembly will be the focus of this research and
              holds the potential for improving the fire safety of wood assemblies. The
              effect of deflections and stresses in the supporting members on the longevity
              of the gypsum board will be quantified. The scope will be limited to 16-mm
              (5/8-in) Type X gypsum and the study of a base connection system of 25-mm
              (1-inch) Type S wallboard screws. Wood members will consist of solid sawn
              lumber and laminated-veneer-lumber (lvl). Several measures of mechanical
              performance of 16-mm Type X gypsum board will be established as a function to
              temperature and duration of fire exposure. These basic properties will be used
              to propose a model for the fire endurance of gypsum board ceiling membranes
              attached to engineered wood components. Intermediate-scale fire tests will be
              conducted to evaluate and verify the fire endurance model of the gypsum
              board.
