This is a planning visit proposal for Professor Matthias Ruth,
              of the Center for Energy and Environmental Studies at Boston University, to
              meet with his Mauritian counterparts for the purpose of finalizing plans for a
              collaborative, multidisciplinary workshop on integrated analysis and management
              of natural resources in Mauritius.  Professor Ruth will meet with Dr. Arjoon
              Suddhoo, Executive Director of the Mauritius Research Council, and Professor
              Indur Fagoonee, Pro-Vice Chancellor of the University of
              Mauritius.

Mauritius, which is located in the southwestern part of the
              Indian Ocean, has a stable government and a growing economy, brought about in
              part by the expansion of tourism.  As tourism has expanded, the demand for new
              facilities has increased, causing many Mauritian natural resources to be
              overburdened and its environment to become degraded.  But Mauritius is still
              home to several rare animal species, such as the echo parakeet, and the last
              remnants of its original coastal forest are in a small nature reserve.  In the
              past, Mauritian investigators interacted with the European and Indian
              scientific communities, and very few American researchers had an opportunity to
              become familiar with Mauritius or its resources.  The proposed workshop can
              provide an opportunity for the participants to exchange information about their
              current projects, identify areas of mutual interest, and stimulate the
              development of collaborative activities.  This planning visit will enable the
              co-organizers to finalize the workshop agenda to maximize these interactions.
