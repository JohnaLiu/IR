Abstract    :
              The Power Systems Engineering Research Center (PSerc) is one of the
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC) supported by the
              National Science Foundation.  The mission of the center is to support research
              activities in electric power systems.  PSerc is headquartered at Cornell
              University.  Presently, several corporations support and direct the activities
              of PSerc.  In addition to Cornell, the University of California at Berkeley,
              Howard University, University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, University of
              Wisconsin at Madison, Washington State University, Iowa State University and
              Arizona State University participate in PSerc.  The addition of the Georgia
              Institute of Technology to the participating universities will have many
              benefits, as outlined in the proposal.  The main objective of this proposal is
              to outline the Georgia Tech research plan within PSerc and to establish a
              research site for PSerc at Georgia Institute of Technology
