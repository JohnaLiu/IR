Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a study of the post-glacial carbon cycle as a
              non-steady state system, where carbon includes the two stable isotopes 12C and
              13C, coupled to the nutrient cycles of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), in the
              four major domains of the Earth's surface system: land, atmosphere, coastal
              zone, and open ocean (including the sediments of these latter two domains). The
              project is a collaborative one between the University of Hawaii (Mackenzie) and
              Northwestern University (Lerman). The work will be based on the modeling
              approach that the principal investigators developed and used with some success
              in the study of the coupled carbon-nitrogen-phosphorus-sulfur cycles in the
              past 300 years, when the system was subjected to human environmental forcings
              and a rise in temperature. A new model of the four domains and coupled C-N-P
              biogeochemical cycles for the analysis of the longer period since the LGM (last
              glacial maximum) to the start of the Industrial Age will include past changes
              and spatial distributions of 13C (effectively separating the carbon cycle into
              the 12C and 13C cycles), and modifications of the numbers and structure of the
              reservoirs within the system, and the kinetic parameters. These fundamental
              feature changes should allow close approximation of the major changes of the
              Earth's surface system in that period of time.
