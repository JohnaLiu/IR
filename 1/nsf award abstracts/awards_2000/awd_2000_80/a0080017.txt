The PI
              proposes to extend the results he has obtained in the development of static
              light scattering diagnostics of aerosol aggregation kinetics.  These
              measurements will be extended to include large particles (including some in the
              turbulent range), and also some cases in need of time resolution.  Some needed
              theoretical work is planned, to characterize the fractal aggregate scattering,
              and also to generalize these assessments to homogeneous spherical aerosols. 
              Fast microphotography will give an insight of the particles size and
              morphology.  These quantitative results will make possible the kinetics
              characterization of aerogelation and turbulent aggregation.

A special effort
              will be to establish the validity limits of the Smoluchovski equation, which
              does not seem to fit some of the earlier measured kinetics in dilute or
              turbulent systems.  Cluster fractal data will yield the evolution beyond the
              diffusional (laminar) regime, while density fields will identify deviations
              from mean-field behavior.
