              Infrastructure:  The Digital CommonSpace

This research program addresses
              symbiotic computing environments in which people use small, communicating
              computers (SCCs) to collect and use information and tools in their personal
              information space.  This information space, which we call a Digital
              CommonSpace, is managed by a broad spectrum of computing and network equipment:
              SCCs, laptops, personal computers and workstations, and servers all
              interconnected by a spectrum of networks.  This research addresses devices,
              systems, and networks; dynamic interconnection facilities; and general
              applications.  There is an emerging computing model for symbiotic computing
              environments in which traditional computer science domains have become blurred:
              The OS must be tailored to meet the needs of application support tools and the
              applications themselves.  The application support software must exploit the OS
              design and while providing custom support to the applications.  Applications
              must use new software paradigms to take advantage of the application support
              tools and OS.  The individuals for this research program have conducted
              research in each of these traditional domains, and they are now focusing on the
              Digital CommonSpace as the mechanism to advance the state-of-the-art symbiotic
              computing.
