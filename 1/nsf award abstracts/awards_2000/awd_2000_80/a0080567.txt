Abstract    :
                   This project proposes a three-year study of the impact of market and
              regulatory changes on the organizational practices of different hospital units,
              seeking to understand how hospitals self-regulate to maintain their value
              systems as they adapt their operational practices in a changing environment.
              Further, it aims to develop a more refined theory of organizational change and
              role stress in dynamic contexts than presently exists, exploring the impact of
              change on organizational and employee outcomes. Finally, the study will develop
              a valid measure of dynamic chage and empirically investigate its impact on unit
              effectiveness, an area that has been neglected in past research. Qualitative
              research centering on interviews with both staff and executives (30-50
              interviews per location), archival data review,  and quantitative analysis of a
              scale for measuring dynamic change as well as mail survey data addressing
              practices and individual attitudes and outcomes from 600 participants will be
              conducted at five different subunits of 2 different hospital locations.
