MII: 
              Infrastructure for a New Program in Computer Science at the University of
              Puerto Rico - Rio Piedras Campus

This project focuses on establishing a
              Division of Computer Science at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras
              (UPR-RP).   Specifically, the project will involve:   (i) cooperation with
              University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez to offer a joint Ph.D.  program in computing
              and information sciences and engineering, (ii) enhancement of cutting-edge
              computer science research at UPR-RP, (iii)  increase in the number of 
              underrepresented students completing a Ph.D. in computer science and (iv)
              increase in the production of cutting edge research projects in computer
              science.  The new equipment will be used to enhance existing research
              activities at UPR-PR and to attract four new faculty who have a proven ability
              to engage in cutting edge research.  The grant will support directly nine
              graduate students.
