This award supports a study exploring the content and practice of
              science in early modern England, prior to the Scientific Revolution of the
              seventeenth century. Through an analysis of intellectual history sources
              (manuscript treatises and published scientific works) as well as social history
              sources (parish, guild, court, and civic records), "Neighborhoods of Science"
              aims to reconfigure dramatically our understanding of English science during
              the lifetime of its most important scientific philosopher, Sir Francis Bacon.
              It will do so by focusing on practitioners in the city of London, rather than
              on the royal court, and on a wide-range of scientific practitioners, rather
              than just a few university-trained philosophers. The study thus focuses on
              practice as well as theory, and popular as well as elite interest in the
              natural world and its properties. During the year of the award the PI will
              visit archives and libraries in England and search for relevant materials, will
              create a database of London's scientific practitioners, and will develop a
              digital map of the city's scientific communities, using the information from
              the database. "Neighborhoods of Science" thus aims to promote a new
              socio-cultural methodology in the history of science, take advantage of the
              tools of spatial analysis, and uncover previously unknown worlds of
              intellectual exchange and collaboration.
