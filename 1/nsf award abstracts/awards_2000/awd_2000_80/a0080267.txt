	This award provides partial funding (66%) support for the
              acquisition and installation of a mass spectrometer capable of measuring
              hydrogen isotope ratios in very small hydrogen samples taken from natural
              materials. The mass spectrometer will be installed and operated in the
              Department of Geosciences at the Pennsylvania State University, and the
              University is committed to providing the remaining funds needed to acquire and
              install the instrument. The capabilities of the new instrument will be used in
              research and educational activities aimed at a better understanding of hydrogen
              pathways through organic and inorganic processes during earth history.
