              Infrastructure:  Optimization of Distributed and Networked Systems: A Spectrum
              of Techniques

This project is exploring a variety of complementary
              techniques for optimizing distributed and networked systems ---from client
              interfaces, through middleware and servers, to the communication
              infrastructure---and they examine a variety of optimization
              criteria---including time, space, power, quality of service, and
              utility.

Client-level projects are investigating ways to reduce power
              consumption and memory requirements, and ways to protect clients and mobile
              code from each other.  The middleware projects are examining ways to support
              interactive visualization of geographical databases and ways to optimize
              evaluation of temporal queries.  The server projects focus on optimizing the
              computational and I/O behavior of large, typically parallel server systems
              connected to many disks; applications include database servers
and parallel
              scientific programs.  The final set of projects examines ways to optimize
              network performance; topics include routing and forwarding in high-speed
              networks, more efficient protocols for wireless networks and mobile
              computations, and a new approach called network-resident storage.
