Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the University
              of Maryland addresses fundamental problems connected with the dynamics of
              ferroelectrics and of surface nanostructures, and with the properties of highly
              spin polarized magnetic oxides.  The MRSEC supports an effective pre-college
              education outreach effort that includes summer science programs for middle
              school girls and hands-on math and science student programs.  The Center has
              intensive activities for knowledge transfer to a large number of industrial and
              federal laboratories.  The MRSEC also supports promising new projects through
              seed funding, and develops and maintains shared experimental facilities.
              

Research in the proposed Center is organized into three Interdisciplinary
              research Groups (IRG).  IRG 1, Polarization Dynamics in Ferroelectric Thin
              Films, addresses key materials issues that will allow to control and optimize
              the time-dependent behavior of thin film ferroelectrics, and that currently
              limit their applicability to computer memories, sensors and actuators.  IRG 2,
              Surface Nanostructures: From Fluctuations to Driven Systems, builds upon
              powerful experimental and theoretical tools developed by this group of
              investigators to predict the surface structural evolution of films under
              various processing conditions, including chemical vapor deposition growth and
              electromigration.  IRG 3, Metal Oxides with High Spin Polarization, focuses on
              issues limiting development of metallic oxides with high spin polarization that
              can be utilized in magnetic devices, including 'spintronics' and magnetic
              sensors.  

Center participants include 23 senior investigators, 8
              post-doctoral associates, 20 graduate students, 10 undergraduates and 2 support
              personnel.  Professor Ellen D. Williams directs the MRSEC.
