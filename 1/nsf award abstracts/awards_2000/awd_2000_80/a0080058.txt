This award supports Wesley Burghardt and Coleen Pugh of
              Northwestern University to hold a U.S.-Germany joint workshop on polymers in
              Evanston, Illinois, Aug. 5-10, 2000.  This is an important symposium of major
              potential impact on the field of polymers.  The topics are excellent and
              include biopolymers and biomaterials, synthetic methodologies, and processing
              in supercritical fluids.  The participants represent a very diverse
              cross-section of the community, including underrepresented groups. 
              Furthermore, the PIs are top young educators and researchers in the field. 
              Previous workshops of this type have established a tradition of high reputation
              and of forging close ties between emerging young scientists of both the U.S.
              and Germany.
