     This project addresses the impact of differences in
              organizational culture and values of
top managers upon mergers and
              acquisitions (M&A) outcomes. While organizational culture and differences in
              values are frequently cited as the cause of M&A difficulties, few empirical
              studies have investigated the impact of such differences on value patterns in
              the new organization, or on its financial performance.  An important barrier to
              such studies has been the difficulty of obtaining a sufficiently large sample
              to permit effective analysis.  Using a theory developed by one of the
              researchers, organizations will be categorized into four organizational value
              profiles, based on values that center around  the organization's reward system.
               Computer-Aided Text analysis (CATA) of organizations' annual reports will be
              used to provide a quantitative measure of nine values that define an
              organization's value profile.  A second objective of the study is to extend
              current theory regarding acculturation following a merger or acquisition,
              addressing questions of uniculturalism in the resultant firm, as assessed by
              cultural consistency.
