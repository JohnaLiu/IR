Abstract    :
              This project is part of the ACE-Asia Program (Aerosol Characterization
              Experiment). A variety of aerosol optical properties will be measured at a
              ground site in Shaanxi Province, China, which is located in the vicinity of
              major dust sources. The measurement period will coincide with the intensive
              observing period of the airborne field program downwind of Northern China, thus
              providing valuable information on aerosol properties in an important source
              region. The PI will measure aerosol light scattering and determine absorption
              coefficients. Aerosol samples in the less than 2.5 micron size fraction will
              also be analyzed for mass, major ionic, and elemental and organic carbon
              concentrations. These measurements will make it possible to determine the
              relative contributions of dust and anthropogenic aerosols to aerosol extinction
              in this region. The PI will also measure the wavelength dependent aerosol
              optical depth, total column water vapor and ozone during clear-sky conditions,
              and photosynthetically active radiation. These measurements will provide
              information on the relationship between dust loading and direct climate
              forcing.
