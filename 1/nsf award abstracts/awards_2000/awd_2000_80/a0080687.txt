The ability to learn and remember
              epitomize the function of the nervous system in all animal species.  Learning
              requires association of environmental stimuli such that they have predictive
              value and retention of these associations between stimuli over time underlies
              memory.  Identification and characterization of the molecular mechanisms
              necessary for learning and memory is cardinal to our understanding of brain
              function and to eventually ameliorate, or cure brain malfunction.  The specific
              problem addressed in this proposal focuses on the function of a very abundant
              group of brain proteins, the 14-3-3 proteins.  The goals of the project are to
              utilize the simple, but genetically powerful Drosophila melanogaster system to
              investigate the properties of these proteins within the brain as they relate to
              learning and memory.  Drosophila has been used extensively as a model system to
              discover genes and functions pertinent to human development.  Since this model
              system is endowed with powerful molecular and genetic tools including the first
              animal genome to be fully sequenced, it offers a unique opportunity to study
              the function of these proteins within the context of the entire live organism. 
              This system allows molecular, genetic histological and behavioral methods to be
              used to understand the role and regulation of 14-3-3 protein function in the
              brain.  
Despite their abundance and presence in every animal species, the
              precise role of 14-3-3 proteins, especially in the context of an entire
              organism is not well understood.  With respect to learning and memory, or brain
              function in general little is known about the role of these proteins. 
              Therefore, the proposed research will lead not only to better understanding of
              the functional properties of 14-3-3 proteins, but will elucidate basic
              molecular mechanisms of brain function essential for learning and memory.
