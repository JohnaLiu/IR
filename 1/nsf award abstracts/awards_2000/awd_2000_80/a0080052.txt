Abstract    :
              The U.S. Africa Materials Workshop, an international workshop on
              materials
Research, education, and technology, is being planned for August
              6-9, 2000 in Pretoria,
South Africa.  This workshop will be the fifth in a
              series involved NAFTA countries
(1995), European countries (1996),
              Pan-American countries (1998), and Asian Pacific
countries (1998).  All of
              these workshops shared the common goal of fostering greater
international
              cooperation and collaboration in materials research, technology,
              and
education.  Participants in these workshops have expressed the desire to
              establish a 
Materials World Net, which would link materials scientists and
              engineers around the 
world by providing them with access to comprehensive
              databases and data warehouses.
The workshop program will focus on discussions
              of topics already selected by the 
Organizers from the participating
              countries.  These topics are Education and Training,
Civil Infrastructural
              Materials, Materials Value-Chain, Advanced and Emerging
Materials, and
              Application of Polymers and Composites.  The goal of the workshop is to
              
Enhance international collaboration in materials research, technology, and
              education 
Between US and Africa.
%%%
A potential outcome of the proposed US
              Africa Materials Workshop, is the 
Continued pursuit of the goal of creating
              this Materials World Net to foster greater
Cooperation and collaboration in
              the field of materials research, education, and
Technology worldwide.

The
              U.S. Africa Materials Workshop is being jointly funded by the Directorate for
              Mathematical 
and Physical Sciences, The Directorate for Engineering and the
              International Division of the
Directorate for Social and Behavioral
              Sciences.
