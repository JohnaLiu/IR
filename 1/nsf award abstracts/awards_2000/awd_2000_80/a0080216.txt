Abstract    :
              The aftermath of natural disasters during the past decade, rapid evolution of
              design and construction methods, heightened expectations by the public and
              scrutiny of perceived and actual deficiencies in codes and code enforcement
              have made it clear that an improved basis for designing new residential
              structures and assessing the condition of the existing housing building stock
              is required. Among the high-priority areas identified at a recent workshop on
              wood engineering research needs were: behavior and performance of wood
              structural systems; criteria for performance assessment; and methods for
              condition assessment of damaged systems following natural disasters. The
              development of system reliability analysis tools is essential to meet these
              needs. A fragility model of building system is an essential ingredient of a
              system reliability analysis. The goal of the proposed research is to provide a
              general methodology for assessing probable response of light-frame residential
              construction exposed to various levels of natural and man-made hazards. This
              methodology will support enhancements in durability and reduction in
              maintenance costs, facilitate reductions in risk of death, injury and property
              damage from extreme natural hazards, and provide a technical basis for the new
              paradigm of performance-based engineering of residential construction.
