Abstract    :
              	Reactions of gases at solid interfaces play a key role in atmospheric
              chemistry. This project aims at developing a better understanding of the
              surface composition of systems that make up atmospheric particles, such as sea
              salt particles and sea salt ice. In particular, the phenomenon of surface
              segregation in mixed halides (e.g. NaCl doped with Br) will be studied using
              X-ray photoelectron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and other
              techniques. The kinetics and mechanisms of other heterogeneous reactions
              relevant to atmospheric chemistry will also be studied, including the particle
              size dependence of the effect of water on reactions on NaCl surfaces, and
              preliminary studies of chemistry on soot.
