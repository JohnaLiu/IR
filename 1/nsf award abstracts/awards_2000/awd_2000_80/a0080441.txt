Abstract    :
              The primary goal of this proposal is to develop the spectral, asymptotic, and
              stability analysis for three increasingly more complete models of an aircraft
              wing in a surrounding airflow, which are governed by complicated systems of
              evolution-type integro -differential equations. The first two of these models
              (1-dim and 2-dim respectively) have been developed at the Flight Systems
              Research Center at UCLA in collaboration with NASA Dryden Flight Research
              Center.  The designing of the 3-dim model is in progress.  The 1-dim model has
              recently been tested in a series of four flight experiments at Edwards Airforce
              Base.  The results have shown an excellent agreement with theoretical
              predictions of the model, at least, for lower frequency aeroelastic modes.  The
              ultimate goal of the entire wing modeling projects is to give specific
              practical recommendations to aircraft industry engineers working on flutter
              suppression in aircraft wings.  

The objective of this project include
              completion of the analysis of 1-dim model, i.e., obtaining the asymptotics for
              the eigenfunctions of the continuous spectrum and deriving the space-time
              domain representation for the solution of the main equations; b) applying the
              results to the flutter suppression problem; c) extension of the analysis to
              2-dim and forthcoming 3-dim models (the most challenging part of the project);
              d) developing of a new graduate program on mathematical methods in aircraft
              engineering for both mathematics and engineering students
