The international conference THERMEC 2000 is planned
              for Las Vegas, NV, December 4-8, 2000.  Two earlier THERMEC conferences were
              held in Japan (1988) and Australia (1997). It was decided to hold this
              conference in the US because of the cutting-edge materials research that is
              being carried out in different academic, government, and industrial
              laboratories in the US. THERMEC 2000 Conference topics include materials
              advancements in light metal alloys (aluminum, magnesium, and titanium), steels,
              composites, superalloys, coatings, and superconductors and related materials
              processing and fabrication techniques. The NSF support is directed toward
              assisting graduate students in attending the meeting.
%%%
The scientific
              knowledge of materials has reached a level that permits the development of
              advanced materials by innovative, closely-controlled processing and fabrication
              techniques.  This conference examines recent progress in this field.
