              Research Infrastructure:  Digital Campus: Scalable Information Services on a
              Campus-Wide Wireless Network

Researchers at the University of California at
              Santa Barbara will implement a wireless-networked, distributed heterogeneous
              environment on campus and use it to conduct research in databases, networking,
              distributed systems, and multimedia.  The PIs will focus on large-scale systems
              in which data is the critical resource and system services are based on various
              data manipulation functions including data collection, movement/delivery,
              aggregation/processing, and presentation.  A significant part of the research
              will be conducted using a digital classroom, a remote classroom, and individual
              and team kiosks.  Services such as lecture on demand, virtual offices, and
              remote learning will be provided using this infrastructure.  Specific research
              issues that will be investigated include content-based access, personalized
              views, multi-dimensional indexing, smart end-to-end applications, joint
              source-network coding, scalable storage, reliable network service, information
              summarization, distributed collaboration, multimedia annotation, and
              interactivity.
