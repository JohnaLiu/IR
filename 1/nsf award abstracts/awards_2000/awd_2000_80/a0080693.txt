Abstract    :
              This project will identify materials and devices for the construction of
              Sensitive Skin.  Sensitive Skins will enable machines to sense over their
              entire surface, operate in unstructured environments, and become "cautious." 
              The availability of Sensitive Skin would trigger a revolution in service
              automation, raise the efficiency of machine use, thereby greatly benefiting the
              environment, and provide powerful prosthetic devices to humans.  The project
              will begin by exploring the incorporation of integrated circuit type
              metalization in bendable and stretchable passive circuits.  Their physical
              components will be first meanders then helices of interconnect wires made by
              thin film techniques.  These will be embedded near the neutral plane of the
              circuit structure.  Active devices, primarily thin film transistors, at first
              will be confined to rigid platforms.  Depending on advances made in the
              experimental and theoretical understanding of stretchable metalization, further
              experiments will address flexible active devices and circuits.  The result of
              this project will be basic design rules for constructing Sensitive Skin.
