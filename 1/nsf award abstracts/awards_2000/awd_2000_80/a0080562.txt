Abstract    :
              The PIs propose to increase the effectiveness of the U.C. Berkeley Computer
              Science Department teaching faculty and to extend the reach of the program well
              beyond the confines of the campus and the duration of a traditional academic
              career. In particular, the proposed approach will take advantage of
              problem-based learning to maintain a high standard of quality and will utilize
              electronic tools that can support the special time and space requirements of
              off-campus learners.

By incorporating the principles and knowledge of
              problem-based learning, learner-centered design, computer-supported cooperative
              work, and current research projects in the department, an informed design of a
              suite of learning, collaboration, and awareness tools will be developed,
              including:

    Enhanced lecture viewing tools, including secondary
              discussion channel chat and participation, TVI and DTVI, asynchronous
              discussion groups, and analysis tools
    Media sharing tools with
              asynchronous discussion and scaffolding tools to support group work, including
              integration of note-taking tools that are searchable across a number of classes
              and projects
    Group awareness tools for keeping students informed about
              what others in their group are working on, how much they have accomplished, as
              well as what other groups are doing
    Monitoring tools to track electronic
              communications & tool usage by student groups
    Instructor awareness tools
              for identifying group progress and lack of progress in achieving project and
              learning goals, including analysis tools using data generated from the
              monitoring tools
