	Our research program objectives are the design and growth of novel
              InAlGaN-based quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs) operating in the mid-infrared
              spectral region.  The materials for these devices will be grown by metalorganic
              chemical vapor deposition and will be characterized by a variety of techniques,
              including X-ray diffraction, optical absorption, photoluminescence, and
              transmission electron microscopy.  The QCL devices offer the potential for a
              dramatic performance improvement over other types of injection lasers including
              a smaller dependence of the threshold current upon operating temperature (i.e.,
              a higher To), a more stable emission wavelength vs. temperature, and higher
              quantum efficiency.  In addition, the III-N materials potentially offer
              significant advantages over other III-Vs used for infrared laser applications. 
              This program will lead to the demonstration of nitride QCLs emitting in the
              near infrared (IR) in the 4-12m-wavelength regime used in optical sensing
              applications, as well as potentially at other longer-wavelength mid-IR
              wavelengths (e.g., 15-30m).  Other possibilities include the realization of
              1.33 and 1.55mm lasers using this approach.  Graduate student training is
              emphasized in this program.
