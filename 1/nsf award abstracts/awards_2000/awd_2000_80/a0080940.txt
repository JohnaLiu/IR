              Computer Science and Engineering: Extending the Pipeline

The proposed
              project concentrates on: (i) building community among relatively isolated
              majority-Hispanic institutions, so that students early in the pipeline have
              access to role models, (ii) building a strong graduate program in a
              majority-Hispanic community, so that students and the program can take
              advantage of existing community and university  support structures,  and (iii)
              building communities of interest among the four-year colleges, an M.S. and
              Ph.D. granting  university with the experience and capabilities to support
              Hispanic students, and Ph.D. granting research universities so that the
              students late in the pipeline have a high level of engagement with excellent
              research.
