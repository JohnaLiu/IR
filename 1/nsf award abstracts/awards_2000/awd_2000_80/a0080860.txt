Abstract    :
              This project describes network patterns among email users in the United States,
              identifying how electronic relations form and the implications of such
              relations for behavior.  In the first of three stages, the project identifies
              the global features of electronic communication networks by identifying sets of
              people linked through email exchange.  This sample provides the information
              needed to identify network features such as social distance, social cohesion,
              small-world properties, social balance, and segregation.  Stage two examines
              the dynamic details of electronic networks by collecting in-depth information
              about online activity, social behaviors, and demographic characteristics over a
              year for a sample of the original study population.  Using these data,
              researchers can model the stability of online relationships and the effect of
              network position on social behaviors.  The third stage of the project
              re-contacts members of the original sample a year later.  Data from this stage
              allows researchers to develop network-contextual models of social behavior that
              situate individual behavior within both local and global network contexts.  The
              three stages of this project provide social network researchers and information
              technology specialists with an unprecedented ability to model network effects
              on social behavior and patterns of social relations in the rapidly changing
              electronic social context.
