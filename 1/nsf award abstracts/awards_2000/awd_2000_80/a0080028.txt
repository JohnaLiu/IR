Vertebrates share a common body plan, centered on the dorsal
              axis.  Despite this similarity, early embryos of different vertebrates generate
              the common body plan in different ways.  Frogs rely on molecules localized in
              the egg, while birds and mammals rely on later cell interactions.  The
              evolution of the reptile/bird egg from the amphibian egg involved a huge
              increase in egg size, and this increase may have altered early development.  To
              examine the impact of large egg size on early development, embryos of the
              Puerto Rican tree frog, Eleutherodactylus coqui, will be investigated.  The egg
              of E. coqui is 20X the volume of that of Xenopus laevis, the frog whose
              development is best known.  The evolutionary impact of this increase in size
              will be examined in three ways.  First, alterations in egg organization will be
              investigated by determining the localization in E. coqui of RNAs, known to be
              important in patterning the X. laevis embryo.  Second, the origin of the
              initial cell types, the germ layers, will be examined with the expectation that
              certain features of embryo patterning may resemble those of reptile or bird
              embryos.  Finally, new evidence suggests that the dorsal axis arises
              differently in E. coqui than in X. laevis.  An examination of these differences
              may show how the key element in vertebrate development can evolve.  The results
              will demonstrate how an evolutionary increase in egg size affects mechanisms of
              early developmental patterning, and will suggest how the reptile/bird egg
              arose
