Abstract    :
              This research proposes to investigate the factors that account for "good
              engineering" and make an engineer a "high performer," factors that have
              received much less attention than studies of "best practices." The project will
              undertake case studies of manufacturing firms in five industries to identify
              and examine the criteria that define an engineer as a "high performer"; the
              education and work experiences that are most important for high peerformance
              (as identified by "high performing" engineers and their managers); and where
              the strengths and deficits are in enegineering education. The present proposal
              is the US component of a cross-national study, coordinated with research teams
              in Japan and Germany examining these same issues with a common core set of
              questions.
