The 42nd Gordon Research Conference on Separation and
              Purification


This award supports partially the participation by invited
              speakers and discussion leaders from academic institutions at the Gordon
              Research Conference on Separation and Purification to be held in New London,
              NH, from August 6 to August 11, 2000.  The sessions scheduled for this year's
              conference include Bioseparations, Crystallization of Organic Materials,
              Nonideal and Reactive Distillation, Extraction, Novel Separation Methods and
              Equipment, Simulation of Mixed-gas Adsorption, Membrane Separation, and
              Microchemical Separation.  In each session there will be two or three invited
              speakers.  A poster session is also planned.

The Gordon Conferences are kept
              small and are structured to give the participants considerable time for
              discussion and interaction.  Such gatherings provide a vehicle for
              communication between research groups, which will be represented here by
              researchers not only from U.S. universities but also from key industrial
              organizations.  This grant is specifically targeted to permit attendance by ten
              advanced-level graduate students in the conference as well as university
              faculty. The impact of the conference is expected to arise from the
              communication between industrial and academic researchers to identify key
              research issues.
