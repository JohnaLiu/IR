Abstract    :
              This dissertation research improvement grant examines the impact of changing
              international and national standards on human and non-human actors in the South
              African red meat commodity chain. South Africa only recently has had the
              opportunity to become an acceptable partner in the international trading arena.
              In order to be successful in international markets, South Africa may have to
              adopt standards that call into question the existing "traditional" standards
              that have and continue to serve other purposes, beyond the economic. This
              project will examine the way standards shape and are shaped by social
              interaction, and therefore, will reveal the ethical values that are embedded in
              standards. Such an understanding will improve the ability to examine the impact
              of global trade in agriculture and food on diverse groups of actors,
              particularly as they differ by race and gender, at the national and local
              levels. The project utilizes four complementary methods to analyze how
              standards promote particular values and how differing networks negotiate these
              standards. The methods include: (1) semi-structured interviews, (2) on-going
              participant observation, (3) a review and analysis of technical documents
              related to the historical development of red meat standards, and (4) a review
              of official statistics on the red meat industry in South Africa.
