Abstract    :
              0080465  Storm  This grant supports conference costs and travel for participants
              in the "2000 Environmental Sciences: Water" Gordon Research Conference to be
              held at Holderness School, Plymouth, New Hampshire, June 25-30, 2000. The
              Gordon Research Conferences provide informal, off-the-record sessions for
              researchers to freely discuss their research interests.   This conference
              (Environmental Sciences: Water) has been held every two years since the 1960's.
              The theme of this year's conference is "Environmental Pressures and Chemical
              Pathways from the Molecular to the Ecosystem Scale" and has as one of its goals
              the modification of the "water-centric" focus to include processes and
              pressures occurring at and across boundaries from the molecular to the
              ecosystem scales.  Participants from the USA, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland,
              Great Britain and Canada are scheduled to discuss the following topics: (1)
              Global climatic variability and impacts; (2) Environmental biogeochemistry from
              the molecular to ecosystem scale; (3) Environmental aquatic chemistry (in honor
              of James J. Morgan); (4) Modeling contaminant fate in aquatic systems; (5)
              Biological processes in natural and engineered systems; (6) Environmental
              biogeochemistry of natural and pollutant organic compounds; (7) Environmental
              partitioning of organic compounds and (8) Limits to growth. ***
