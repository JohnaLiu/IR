This grant provides partial support of the costs of acquiring
              both a particle size analyzer and a carbon dioxide coulometer for the analysis
              of the total organic and inorganic carbon contents of sediment samples.  This
              basic equipment of the analysis of sediment characteristics will facilitate
              ongoing and planned paleoclimatic and sedimentological research by faculty in
              the Geology Department at East Carolina University.  Studies of lacustrine and
              riverine sediments cored in the Bolivian Altiplano, one of the few sedimentary
              archives of low latitude Quaternary paleoclimates in the southern hemisphere,
              should yield new insights into low latitude climate fluctuations and its
              influence on human settlement in the high Andes.  Additionally, studies of the
              Holocene development of the Outer Banks barrier island system and the
              sedimentological response of these systems and coastal plain estuaries to
              frequent large storm events (i.e. Hurricane Floyd, 1999) are a natural focus of
              faculty in this department proximally located to one of the world's great
              natural laboratories for the study of barrier beach and estuarine
              dynamics.
