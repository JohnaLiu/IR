Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project has as
              the primary focus the development and commercialization of a novel microsensor
              for the in-situ, real-time detection of toxic organic chemicals. The proposed
              microsensor will be capable of operating under field conditions, with
              sufficient sensitivity to permit high detection rates, and with sufficient
              selectivity to prevent high false alarm rates. Using a revolutionary
              photo-thermal concept, the detector will operate with both high chemical
              selectivity and a less than parts per billion sensitivity. The technological
              concept of the proposed detector (CalSpec) won the 1998
R&D 100 award. The
              chemical sensitivity can be substantially enhanced to a less than parts per
              trillion level by simply operating in an integrating chemical detection mode.
              The objective of this research is to demonstrate highly specific, sensitive and
              selective detection of organic chemical compounds and to develop a
              multichemical detector which can detect toxic organics with concentrations
              varying from a few parts per thousand to a few parts per trillion.

Sensitive
              monitoring and detection is an area of continuing importance to EPA, DOD, DOE
              and other federal agencies. The CalSpec detector could be used in a variety of
              applications, including process monitoring and control, environmental
              compliance (including emissions monitoring), ambient air monitoring, airport
              security, personal dosimeters for toxic gases or metal vapor, and smoke and
              fire constituent detection.
