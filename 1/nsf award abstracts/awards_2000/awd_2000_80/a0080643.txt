Abstract    :
              

Although sustainable business practices are much lauded in the abstract,
              there is little grounded research on how contemporary enterprises, facing
              increasingly complex environments, where many causes and effects are distant in
              time and place and correspondingly difficult to comprehend; and where
              behavioral complexity is exacerbated by numerous, diverse agents with decision
              making power, can evolve effective approaches. This study proposes a series of
              collaborative research studies among the collaborative industrial partners of
              the Society for Organizational Learning to focus on how learning might take
              place within the consortium around topics related to sustainable enterprise
              business practices. In Phase I of the project, a series of research studies is
              planned that involves: 1) facilitating and documenting learning and new
              practices in the Consortium as a whole; 2) historical case studies of
              individual organizations' learning and change projects; and 3) ongoing active
              participation and observation of learning and change projects within sub-groups
              of the Consortium. A multi-method approach is proposed, including community
              action research with teams of insiders and outsiders; content analysis of
              documents, email and conversations; structured and semi-structured interviews;
              causal loop diagramming and systems thinking assessments; sociograms;
              observation of boundary objects used in Consortium change projects; and
              selective comparisons with non-consortium control groups. Phase II studies will
              emerge as the Consortium gains experience in Phase I.
