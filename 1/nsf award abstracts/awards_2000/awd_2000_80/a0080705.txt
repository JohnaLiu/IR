Abstract    :
                 This proposal represents Phase 3 of the Global Leadership and Organizational
              Behavior Effectiveness Research Program (GLOBE). Phase 1 concerned scale
              development and validation of measurement instruments; Phase 2 collected data
              from 18,000 managers employed in over 1,000 organizations in 62 cultures. These
              data were used to test hypotheses derived from an integration of implicit
              leadership theory and structural contingency theory of organizational forms and
              practices. Phase 3 seeks to test additional hypotheses, some of which would
              deal with longitudinal relationships in the data. Phase 3 data will be
              collected from 50 top management teams in each of 23 societies that vary widely
              on nine core dimensions of societal culture. These data will be related to the
              nine core societal GLOBE dimensions previously measured in Phase 2. Data for
              Phase 3 have already been collected in four cultures, with this preliminary
              data being used to refine research instruments for subsequent data
              collection.
     Teams of Country Co-Investigators (CCIs) have made
              commitments to collect substantial additional data from 50 organizations in 23
              cultures, with half of the organizations to be studied to be entrepreneurial
              for-profit organizations and half non-entrepreneurial for-profit organizations.
              Approximately 10 executives involved in substantial international business will
              be included in each country sample. Phase 3 will also assess the degree to
              which effective strategic organizational changes introduced by CEOs or top
              management teams are associated with the leader behavior of the CEOs and the
              effectiveness of the top management team.
     Interviews will be conducted
              and analyzed by CCIs to identify country-specific manifestations of the core
              leadership dimensions and other country-specific leader behavior, as well as
              major strategic changes in the recent past or planned for the near future. 
  
               To date, over 100 GLOBE-related research reports have been presented at
              professional conferences, 30 scholarly articles based on Phase 1 and 2 research
              have been published, and 30 country-specific chapters based on a combination of
              quantitative and qualitative research have been completed.  Funds are requested
              for Phase 3 data collection and analysis, further write-up of prior results
              (particularly editing of a planned anthology of completed chapters). It is
              anticipaed that Phase 3 findings will make a substantial contribution to the
              cross-cultural literature concerning leadership, organizational structure and
              strategy, and organizational change.
