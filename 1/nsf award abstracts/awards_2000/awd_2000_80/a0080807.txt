Abstract    :
              The proposal requests support for graduate students and post docs to attend a
              workshop on neutrino factories based on muon storage rings.  This workshop will
              bring together accelerator experts, experimental and theoretical physicists to
              study physics potential of such facilities.  It will also help to define a
              worldwide R&D program necessary to address the technological issues associated
              with their construction.
