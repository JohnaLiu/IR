Abstract    :
              
To understand the basics of normal growth, it is useful to study how growth
              hormone (GH), a key regulator of normal growth, alters gene function.  Studying
              regulation of the cancer-related gene c-fos by GH, multiple DNA sequences and
              gene-directing proteins (transcription factors) have been identified that
              participate in GH action.  Most recently, it has been found that the
              transcription factor known as CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein (C/EBP) b plays a
              wide role in GH-regulated gene expression, and mediates function of multiple
              genes involved in the physiological actions of GH.  This awardee will examine
              the effects of GH on cells from mice deficient in C/EBP-b (knockouts).  The
              ability of GH to regulate c-fos will be examined first to determine whether the
              well-characterized regulation of this gene by GH is deficient in the absence of
              C/EBP-b and can be restored when C/EBP-b is restored in the cells.  Then other
              GH-dependent genes will also be examined in the C/EBP-b cells to determine
              whether C/EBP-b has a general role in GH-regulated gene expression.  The
              effects of GH on growth will be examined in the C/EBP-b deficient mice.  The
              role of a mediator of GH-stimulated growth, insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF
              1), will be tested by crossing the C/EBP-b deficient mice with mice genetically
              altered in IGF 1 regulation.  These studies may identify whether there are
              common mechanisms involving C/EBP-b by which the actions of GH are coordinated,
              through changes in GH-regulated programs of gene expression.
