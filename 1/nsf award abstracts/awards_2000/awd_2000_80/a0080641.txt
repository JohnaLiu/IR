              ABSTRACT   ( ECS - 0080641)

The main goal of the proposed research is the
              development of a compact 4.8 nm laser in a transition to the ground state in
              hydrogen-like BV ions.  This concept is an extension toward shorter wavelength
              of the Soft X-ray Laser (SXL),which was demonstrated at Princeton in transition
              to the ground state in H-like LiIII at 13.5 nm.The 13.5 nm SXL operates at a
              repetition rate of  2 Hz using only a 50 mJ, 250 fsec pumping beam (intensity: 
              1-2 x  ).  The procedure and experimental set-up for the demonstration of high
              gain-length product (GL) for the 4.8 nm SXL is the same as that of the 13.5 nm
              SXL, except much higher intensities are required (~ ).  Such intensities will
              be available from our system through the refurbishing of our 12-year old KrF
              large volume amplifier.
        
The 4.8 nm laser in transition to ground
              state of hydrogen-like BV ions would be the shortest wavelength compact, very
              efficient X-ray laser ("Table top" X-ray laser).  Demonstration of the lasing
              at 4.8 nm would be the most straight-forward extension to shorter wavelength of
              13.5 nm laser in transition to ground state of H-like Li III ions. Development
              of 4.8 nm in H-like BV ions will provide crucial scaling point for the
              development of this type of lasers at shorter wavelength (at 3.4 nm in CVI in
              "water window" and at even shorter wavelengths).
