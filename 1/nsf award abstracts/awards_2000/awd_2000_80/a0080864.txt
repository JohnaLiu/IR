Abstract    :
              This project evaluates the use and social impacts of Blacksburg Electronic
              Village, one of the prominent American community networking projects of the
              1990s. It employs community surveys, detailed interviews, session logging, a
              participatory evaluation forum, and a variety of psychological scales. It
              addresses a variety of key issues: Who participates in community networks? What
              are the networks used for? How are local business activities and opportunities
              changed, and how direct a cause is the network? In what ways does access to
              local government information, or to public decision-making change? What are the
              consequences for community life, and for community health and well-being? How
              is participation in community life greater or more diverse? Do people feel
              safer in a community networking context than in the general Internet context?
              Do they feel their personal data is safer? Can a community network enhance
              self-perceptions of collective self-efficacy in the community? Has the social
              capital of the Blacksburg community increased as a consequence of the BEV? And
              what are the causes and effects of unequal participation throughout the
              community? The vision of community networking is inspiring; it extends creative
              participation to citizens through computing. Systematic evaluation of these new
              opportunities is timely and appropriate.
