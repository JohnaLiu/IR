Abstract    :
              This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase II project will
              develop a cell-mimic optical-based biosensor for the real-time detection of
              foodborne biological pathogen. Five million analytical tests are performed on
              food annually in the U.S.; unfortunately, current microbiological test methods
              are time consuming and labor intensive. Intelligent Optical Systems, in
              collaboration with the Scripps Research Institute, proposes to develop an
              optical biosensor that mimics a cell membrane that has undergone biological
              pathogen attack. The response of the cell-mimic biochromatic membrane to the
              foodborne toxins is sensitive, specific, and instantaneous.  During Phase I,
              the team developed "highly stable" cell-mimic membranes and demonstrated them
              in two laboratory systems: (1) a cell-mimic optical waveguide sensor (COWS) for
              "in-line" monitoring, and (2) a cell-mimic optical bead sensor (COBS) for
              "on-site point detection". These laboratory systems were used to detect
              foodborne toxins (E. coli-enterotoxin and cholera toxin) with excellent speed
              (< 1 minute), sensitivity (500 - 1 ng/ml), specificity (molecular receptor),
              and simplicity (one step). Phase II will focus on optimizing the cell-mimic
              biochromatic polymers, engineering and field-testing a portable COBS prototype,
              and extending the tests to other foodborne toxins.
