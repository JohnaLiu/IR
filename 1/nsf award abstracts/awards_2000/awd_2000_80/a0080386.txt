Abstract    :
                   Techbridge is a three-year Large Collaborative Project between Chabot
              Observatory and Science Center, Oakland Unified School District, California
              State University-Hayward, Mills college, Lawrence Livermore National
              Laboratory, and Community Resources for Science that (1) encourages girls to
              pursue academic and career options in technology and (2) contributes much
              needed research regarding gender, culture, and technology.  This model program
              takes an innovative approach to engage teachers, counselors, families, role
              models, and peer support networks in keeping girls involved and motivated in
              technology.  Techbridge utilizes project-based learning to introduce girls to
              technology and role models to help girls realize that technology is a tool for
              many different career options.  It builds bridges to ease the transition from
              middle school to high school and helps girls visualize the next steps to
              college and careers.  In addition to quantitative analysis that will track and
              assess the progress of participating girls, qualitative analysis will study the
              complex interaction of gender and culture on girls' experiences with technology
              and choices regarding coursework and career plans to better understand how
              families and schools can support girls.  Project partners will work together to
              institutionalize project findings and resources into existing teacher training
              and district programs for long-lasting impact.
