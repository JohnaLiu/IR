This award supports the participation of 12 US
              scientists and engineers in a US-South Africa Workshop on Catalysis Research,
              scheduled for June 2000 in Pretoria, South Africa.  The organizers are Harold
              H. Kung, Department of Chemical Engineering, Northwestern University, Neil
              Coville, Department of Chemistry, University of the Witwatersrand,
              Johannesburg, and Cyril O'Connor, Dean of Engineering and the Built
              Environment, University of Cape Town, South Africa.  The workshop will focus on
              technical discussions in order to identify potential collaborative research
              projects.  Participants from both countries will be drawn from academia,
              government, and industry.  The three primary themes of the workshop are
              selective oxidation catalysis, zeolite synthesis and analysis, and supported
              metal catalysis.

Catalysis plays a central role in chemical manufacturing
              and energy conversion industries throughout the world.  Catalysis has also
              found increasing applications to improve environmental quality.  Although there
              are numerous ongoing collaborations between researchers in the United States
              and Europe and Japan, relatively few exist with Africa.  The area of catalysis
              is particularly appropriate for US-South African collaboration.  In some
              selected heterogeneous catalytic technologies, South Africa is a world leader. 
              South Africa has the only industrial-scale Fischer-Tropsch process.  Further
              collaborative activity among US and South African researchers is expected to
              result from this workshop.  This award is supported jointly by the Division of
              International Programs and the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems.
