	This award provides partial funding support for the
              fabrication of an integrated downhole sensor package to be installed in the
              Long Valley Exploratory Well (a 3-kilometer deep hole drilled for geophysical
              observations in the Long Valley Caldera). Since 1980 the Long Valley Caldera
              has shown sustained unrest characterized by recurring earthquake swarms,
              dome-shaped uplift, and increased levels of fumarolic activity as well as high
              concentrations of CO2 gas emitted through its surface soils. The sensor package
              to be built will include a dilatometer/strainmeter, seismometers, and pressure
              sensors. The combination of measurements, made at depth and presumably close to
              the magmatic source, will allow probing of changes in the volcanic system with
              heretofore unprecedented sensitivity.
