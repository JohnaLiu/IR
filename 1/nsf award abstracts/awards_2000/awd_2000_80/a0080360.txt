Abstract    :
              The project is a study of Kant's justification of Newtonian science. It shows
              how Kant's justification of Newtonian science is a justification not of the
              fundamental principles of Newton's Principia, but rather of Newtonian science,
              that is, how Newton's Principia was received in 18th century Germany.  Given
              the rich array of ways in which various figures attempted to come to terms with
              Newtonian science, the project illustrates how Kant's attempt at justifying
              Newtonian science most closely resemble projects by those with significant
              interests in metaphysics (e.g., Leibnizians such as Wolff, Knutzen, Gottsched).
                Kant sees the need to develop non-empirical justifications of Newtonian
              principles and to articulate an ontology that is compatible with Newtonian
              physics (given his rejection of Newtonian absolute space and time). The results
              of this project should benefit anyone interested in the history of philosophy
              of science, the history of science, and the history of philosophy, and, in
              general, to those interested in understanding the complex relations among
              natural science and philosophy.
