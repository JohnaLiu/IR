Abstract    :
              Oriented Strandboard (OSB) is a structural wood composite widely used in house
              construction as sheathing, flooring, and I-joist materials.  As a biological
              material, OSB is subject to attack from Formosan termites, which nationwide
              cause over $2 billion a year in damages to homes. Borate-based systems have
              been shown to provide adequate termite protection for OSB. However, the
              addition of the chemical often leads to a significant reduction in the strength
              and durability of OSB.  The goal of this project is to pursue an overall
              understanding of the influence of borate addition on OSB's strength and
              long-term durability.  The specific objectives are: (1) To develop pressing
              technology for manufacturing OSB with borate-modified flakes; (2) To determine
              the effects of borate addition on panel stiffness, strength, and stability; (3)
              To determine contents and micro-distribution of zinc-borate within wood flakes;
              and (4) To measure and model the creep behavior of the OSB.  In this work,
              borate-modified OSB panels will be manufactured.  Panel strength, chemical
              content and distribution, swelling and creep properties will be determined. 
              Mathematical models will be developed to describe observed creep and durability
              behavior.  The work will lead to the development of processing technology and
              fundamental durability information information for the manufacture of durable
              OSB with sound biological performance.
