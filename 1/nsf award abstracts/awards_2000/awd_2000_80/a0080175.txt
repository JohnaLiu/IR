Dr. McCarty will continue his analysis of genes in maize and
              arabidopsis that encode B3 type DNA binding proteins.  He has shown that the B3
              protein structure defines a new class of DNA binding proteins that are found
              only in the genomes of plants.  In plants, B3 genes include a family of
              regulatory genes that control key aspects of seed development, hormone
              signaling, and leaf and floral organ development.  He is intrigued by the
              broader issue of the role kingdom specific transcription factors like the B3
              proteins have had in the evolution of eukaryotic organisms.  He will dissect
              the developmental functions of key B3 gene families in two distantly related
              plant species, maize and arabidopsis.  He will leverage a robust set of
              molecular tools and new insight into how B3 proteins are regulated.  He will
              characterize a regulatory mutation in B3 and use that mutant as a basis for
              mutant screens in arabidopsis.  He will extend our use of the aleurone cell
              layer of the maize endosperm as a genetic model for analysis B3 function in
              monocot plant development.  Finally, he will begin functional analysis of a
              second B3 gene family that reveals intriguing qualitative differences in
              monocots and dicots.
