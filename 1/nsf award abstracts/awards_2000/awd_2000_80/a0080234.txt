Title:  ITR:  Project on
              Strengths and Limitations of Quantum Information Processing

This project
              provides an opportunity for an outstanding postdoctoral researcher to become
              involved in collaborative research in quantum computing with university and
              industry scientists.  The project is investigating the use of quantum
              information theory in establishing time and communication bounds on quantum
              communication and computing.  The project is also investigating space
              complexity, comparing quantum computers with restricted workspace to classical
              machines.  Finally, taking advantage of the observation that all quantum
              algorithms that currently provide a time advantage may be viewed as black-box
              algorithms, the project is investigating use the "polynomial method" in proving
              lower bounds in the quantum black-box setting.
