TITLE: Support for Student Speakers at MFPS '00


              Abstract

This project provides funding to offset the cost of 
graduate
              student attendance at the Workshop on Mathematical 
Foundations for
              Programming Semantics, MFPS-2000, 
to be held at Stevens Institute of
              Technology April 12-16, 2000.
Invited speakers for MFPS-2000 include Samson
              Abramsky, 
Rance Cleaveland, Andy Gordon, Robin Milner, Peter O'Hearn, 
and
              Dana Scott, each of whom is known for outstanding interaction 
with students. 
              MFPS has always been hospitable to graduate students, 
usually attracting a
              good number of students, who present a 
significant number of talks.  In
              addition, because of the location, 
graduate student participation could be
              unusually high.
Attendees at this event are expected to number less than 100,
              
permitting significant student-researcher interaction.
