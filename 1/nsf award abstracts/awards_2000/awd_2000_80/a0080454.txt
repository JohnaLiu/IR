Abstract    :
              Over the next 25 years, the majority of homes will be computer networked. The
              availability of networked homes is expected to facilitate integrated home
              control of heating, cooling and lighting. The element of the integrated home
              control system that enables significant savings in energy consumption is the
              adaptive shade. With adaptive shading, energy bills in housing with integrated
              controls can fall by 25% or more, the quality of interior light can improve,
              and related household conveniences can emerge.  

A basic understanding of
              the principles underlying the effective use of adaptive shading in housing is
              needed for the full impact of the energy savings to be felt. On this basis,
              this proposal focuses on developing a basic understanding of the principles
              underlying the effective use of adaptive shading for future housing. The four
              objectives of the study are 

(1) to gain an understanding of the home
              designs that accommodate adaptive shading 
(2) to gain an understanding of the
              methods by which energy consumption is reduced with adaptive shading
(3) to
              develop integrated control algorithms for housing and
(4) to foster
              commercialization of low-cost adaptive shading technology.
