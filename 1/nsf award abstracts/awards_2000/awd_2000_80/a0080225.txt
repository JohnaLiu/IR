Abstract    :
              This project supports a component of ACE-Asia (Aerosol Characterization
              Experiment). The project contributes a ground-based aerosol measurement network
              along the Pacific Rim, including sites in the Philippines, Taiwan, Korea,
              China, Japan, and Hawaii in collaboration with Asian scientists. Several of
              these sites have been already established, and others will be added for
              ACE-Asia.
	Aerosols will be collected on portable, continuously sampling,
              sizing impactors and subsets of the collected samples will be later analyzed
              based on meteorological and other data. The analysis techniques include total
              mass, trace metals by synchrotron XRF, measurements of soot and organic matter,
              and ion chromatography. These data will provide information on the size and
              chemical composition aerosols in the boundary layer and lower troposphere in
              East Asia during a time of massive transport into the North Pacific.
              Information on sources and transport pathways will be obtained. Mie
              calculations will be performed to evaluate the radiative impact of these
              aerosols.
