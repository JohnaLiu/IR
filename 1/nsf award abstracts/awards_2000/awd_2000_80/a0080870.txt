Abstract    :
              This award is for a workshop to develop a working plan on reconstructing
              detailed pre-1851 hurricane activity for the Atlantic Basin for the last 2000
              years from a network of high resolution proxy records. The main workshop themes
              will be: 1) to assess the quality and quantity of documentary data suitable for
              reconstruction of Atlantic hurricanes from the different colonial archives, 2)
              to discuss and devise methodologies for merging different colonial archives,
              tree-ring, and sediment records together in order to reconstruct Atlantic
              hurricanes quantitatively as they relate with the modern (20th century)
              hurricane record, and 3) to address the key paleoclimatic issues and potential
              forcing mechanisms (e.g. ENSO) that can be answered from longer records of
              Atlantic hurricanes prior to the modern record.
