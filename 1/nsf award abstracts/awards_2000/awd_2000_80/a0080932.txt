Function of the nervous system depends on correct wiring
              of synaptic connections that communicate information between neurons or between
              neurons and other targets, such as muscles.  Axons make these connections
              during fetal development by extending through intervening tissues to reach the
              targets where they make regularly patterned connections.  Growing axons are
              guided by extrinsic positive and negative guidance cues.  Two of these cues,
              nitric oxide and the neurotrophin BDNF are involved in regulating the formation
              of axonal branches in target organs.  The proposed experiments will examine how
              growing retinal axons integrate signals from these tips, growth cones, to
              establish proper connections between the eye and the brain.  Tissue culture
              studies show that axonal tips, growth cones, collapse when exposed to nitric
              oxide, but if the growth cones are first exposed to BDNF and then nitric oxide,
              they are stabilized against nitric oxide-induced collapse.  The project goals
              are to clarify the intracellular molecular singaling that mediates regulation
              of axon terminal development.

Nitric oxide and BDNF are implicated in a wide
              range of activities that involve structural changes in neural connections. The
              mechanisms that underlie the structural plasticity of early development are
              relevant to ongoing functions on the mature nervous system, such as learning,
              memory and repair of injuries.   Better understanding of these mechanisms will
              help develop strategies to improve nervous function and better treat injuries
              and diseases of the brain.
