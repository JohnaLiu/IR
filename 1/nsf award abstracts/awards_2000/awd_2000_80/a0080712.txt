Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for a pilot program to develop and
              disseminate instructional materials on ethical issues in science via the
              mechanism of Sigma Xi sponsored workshops on university campuses.  Sigma Xi,
              The Scientific Research Society, has 518 chapters, most of which are located at
              US colleges and universities.  This support will allow a small, high-level
              workshop for planning and issue-focusing to occur, to be followed by a
              larger-scale pilot dissemination workshop.  Both will focus on ethical issues
              in science and technology, ranging from issues of research ethics to issues of
              the social implications of science, engineering, and technology.  Materials
              that can be used as foundations for coursework will be made available to other
              academic institutions.  Sigma Xi envisages further dissemination workshops, as
              future funds may allow.
