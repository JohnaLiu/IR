This study combines two approaches to examine the
              relationship between local structure and polarization in ferroelectric
              crystals.  Using scanning tunneling microscopy the effect of electric fields
              and temperature on atomic structure of the (100) surface will be determined. 
              Using variants of electrostatic force microscopy including scanning potential
              microscopy and piezo response imaging, the contributions of atomic polarization
              and charge compensation will be quantified. Single crystal barium titanate will
              serve as the model system in which carrier concentration, and surface charge
              (via adsorption) will be varied.  The effects of applied fields on surface
              adsorption will be quantified.

Ferroelectric ceramics are receiving much
              attention in the context of high density information storage.  This project
              will enhance our understanding of these complex materials by studying their
              properties at the nanometer scale.
