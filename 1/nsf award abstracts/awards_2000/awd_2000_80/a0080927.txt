Abstract    :
              This award is for high-resolution, multiproxy analyses on cores from 3 lakes in
              the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions will
              be based on the following proxy records: (1) sediment lithology and percent
              organic matter - erosion rates and terrestrial and aquatic productivity; (2)
              chironomids - maximum summer water temperatures; and (3) pollen and plant
              macrofossils (stomates, needles and seeds) - vegetation and changes in species
              range limits. The goal of this research is to determine whether the cold events
              and millennial scale climate variability observed in the North Atlantic
              affected the environment of the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
