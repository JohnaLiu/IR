Abstract    :
              0080069/Smethie

This project consists of a study of the way in which dense
              water is 
formed on a shelf and then descends to depth when the shelf-water is
              
subject to a negative surface buoyancy flux. The intent is to model 
dense
              water formation on continental shelves with the Weddell Sea quoted 
as the
              main motivation.  The approach is to perform laboratory 
experiments in a
              rotating tank with a simplified shelf-slope geometry.   
The experiments are
              distinguished from earlier experiments by the use of 
a distributed surface
              buoyancy flux, by a novel approach to trying to 
quantify the viscous flow
              draining fluid from the down-slope gravity 
currents, and by the inclusion of
              canyons and ridges on the slope 
topography.
