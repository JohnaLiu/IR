An investigation of new methods for micro-scale impedance
              and surface potential mapping of surfaces will be undertaken. The AFM
              microscope has been modified to carryout micro-scale two and four point probe
              impedance mapping, and micro-Kelvin surface potential mapping. Custom tips will
              be microfabricated with multiple tips on a single cantilever, and multiple
              cantilevers on a chip. The principle of operation is similar to the macro
              four-point probe except the microfabricated four-point probe will perform
              better in several respects.  First, the testing will yield sub-micron precision
              mapping of conductivity, doping profiles and surface potential, be
              non-destructive and will providing quantitative data from an ambient
              environment, scanning probe platform. Graduate student training will be
              provided in surface probe microscopy and MEMS fabrication methods.
              Commercialization of these analysis methods will be facilitated by the probes
              compatibility with existing AFM technology.
