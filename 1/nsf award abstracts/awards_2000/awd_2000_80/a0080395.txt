Abstract    :
              The project will leverage online education for the benefit of diversity in the
              software profession.  Its goal is to enhance the ability of educational
              institutions to recruit, retain and graduate increased numbers of female and
              minority students in the areas of software design, creation and
              maintenance.
The project is based at Carnegie Technology Education, a
              nonprofit subsidiary of Carnegie Technology Education, a nonprofit subsidiary
              of Carnegie Mellon University, which offers Internet-based learning and
              certification for software developers.  The team will modify ten courses
              developed for 2 and 4 year undergraduate institutions.  The courses will be
              modified to make them more appealing, accessible, and effective for diverse
              learners.  Pilot sites will be selected among institutions already subscribing
              to the courses from Carnegie Technology Education.  The  sites will receive
              special assistance in recruiting diverse students and in gender equity training
              for faculty.  Thus the project will produce new materials and new practices for
              recruiting, teaching, and cirriculum in software development.
