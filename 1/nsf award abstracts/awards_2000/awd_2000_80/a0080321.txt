The American Society for Engineering Education
              (ASEE) is holding the NSF Project Showcase at the 2000 ASEE Annual Conference
              and Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri. The NSF Project Showcase has been part
              of the ASEE conference since 1995. The current project consists of exhibit
              booths showcasing projects sponsored by the Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory
              Improvement and other programs. The Showcase allows conference attendees to see
              a cross section of effective funded projects that can be adapted into the
              classroom.
