This project is carried out in collaboration with Sebastian
              Elbaum (CCR-0080898)of the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. Regression testing
              is an expensive process performed on modified software to provide confidence
              that modifications have not impaired its quality.  To help with this process,
              previous research has considered various test-suite reuse techniques.  Despite
              progress with these techniques, they remain limited along several dimensions. 
              For example, they typically assume that test cases have equivalent costs,
              faults have equivalent severities, and fault likelihood is constant across
              portions of a program.  These assumptions are unrealistic in practice, and
              limit the applicability and effectiveness of techniques.  The proposed research
              will address these limitations.  The research will provide: (1) comprehensive
              regression testing cost models that capture the necessary factors; (2)
              regression testing techniques that account for these factors; (3) more precise
              understanding of the effects these factors have on regression testability,
              program and test design, and software engineering practice; and(4) guidelines
              that help software engineers select and create cost-effective regression
              testing tools and processes.  In addition to providing models, algorithms, and
              processes, the research includes a substantial empirical component, and will
              provide a publicly available base of empirical data about techniques and
              factors.  Together, these contributions will support more efficient and
              effective regression testing, and improve the quality of software.
