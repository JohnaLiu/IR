Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a collaborative study (University of Arizona,
              University of Colorado, and Columbia University, the latter funded under a
              separate award from NOAA) to considerably broaden the scope of past drought
              reconstructions from tree rings, now based on the Palmer Drought Severity
              Index, by (a) improving and geographically expanding the existing grid of North
              American drought reconstructions from tree rings, (b) considering new measures
              of drought, (c) specifically developing techniques for reconstructing and
              analyzing key attributes of gaged streamflow series that are relevant for
              drought management through reservoir operation and water resource allocation,
              and (d) investigating new statistical methods for improving the reconstructions
              and the analysis of space-time drought variability.
