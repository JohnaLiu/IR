Abstract    :
                  This project involves the shipboard measurement of real-time individual
              particle size and chemical composition during the ACE-Asia field experiment. 
              These measurements will be made aboard the NOAA research vessel Ron Brown using
              a transportable aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ATOFMS).  The
              measurements will provide physical and chemical properties of aerosol
              particles, quantification of physical and chemical processes controlling their
              evolution, and assessment of the role of chemical composition of aerosol
              particles in climate change. Of particular interest will be to assess the
              degree of mixing and reaction/aging of the particles present in the sampling
              locations in order to evaluate their temporal and chemical variability.  The
              proposed ATOFMS single particle analysis will help identify and allocate
              relative contributions from different sources, using distinct combinations of
              ion markers from the single particle mass spectra.
