Hysell, David

This is a proposal to conduct a wide-ranging
              program of research on the mid - and low-latitude ionosphere.  The research
              involves observations to be made with a small coherent scatter radar at Clemson
              University and with the Jicamarca incoherent scatter radar (ISR) and the JULIA
              radar near Lima, Peru.  Topics to be investigated include midlatitude sporadic
              E ionization layers, lower thermospheric winds in the equatorial E region, and
              the response of the low latitude ionosphere and plasmasphere to substorms. 
              These topics have overtones for the National Space Weather initiative as well
              as for the CEDAR/TIMED project and several other CEDAR initiatives (Topside,
              POLITE).  The proposal has experimental and theoretical elements and should
              result in the development of new radar hardware, new numerical codes, and an
              improved and enhanced radar database.
