Abstract    :
                   This project compares intellectual development of children in the U.S. to
              the United Kingdom, comparing test scores on mathematics and language, and also
              reports of conduct problems.  The general goal is to test whether findings from
              research in the U.S. also appear in data from another culture.  The surveys in
              the two countries are designed to be highly comparable, thus permitting direct
              comparisons of effects in the two locations.  Factors to be studied include
              family size, intact marriage, and parental work hours.  This study is the first
              to permit direct comparisons of results from the large body of knowledge about
              U.S. families to results from another culture.
