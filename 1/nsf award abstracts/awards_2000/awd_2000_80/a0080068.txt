Abstract

	This project investigates the relationship between
              brain activity and behaviour in the nematode worm C. elegans. The behavior
              studies is chemotaxis, in which an animal finds a food item or other odor
              source by moving in the direction of the strongest smell. The main objective is
              to create a computer model of part of the nematode brain that converts chemical
              sensation into bodily movement. The model will be based on information obtained
              by many methods including laser surgery to eliminate individual neurons in the
              worm brain and electrical recordings from some of the smallest neurons known to
              science.
	Understanding how even a simple brain controls behaviour is
              important for two main reasons. First, to discover the causes of mental illness
              and other forms of abnormal behaviour, we must first understand how neurons and
              genes shape normal behaviour. In humans, which have a 100 billion neurons and
              about 100,000 genes, this is a daunting task. In the nematode, however, there
              are only 302 neurons and 19,000 genes, so progress there should be much
              quicker. Moreover, humans and nematodes share many of their genes, making
              nematode research directly applicable to humans. Second, this project should
              help us build a new generation of smaller, smarter, and cheaper computers by
              unraveling the computation secrets of the brain. Brains can process much more
              information per unit time that computers, and they do so using much less energy
              and space, but how this is done is a mystery. The simplicity of the nematode
              makes its computational mechanisms easier to understand.
