This award supports a project designed to document
              the contributions and experiences of American and British women who were active
              in computing between 1940 and 1990. The project includes travel to conduct
              interviews with 70 to 90 women who were employed in computer science
              departments, the software industry, or business computing during this period.
              The award also supports archival research at several locations in the United
              States and United Kingdom. This research will provide the basis for a scholarly
              book that analyzes how notions of gender shaped both women's opportunities in
              the computing professions and the practice of computer science and programming.
              In addition, the project will create a valuable collection of oral histories
              that will be made available to researchers at an established archive. This
              study will give historians, science studies and women's studies scholars, and
              the general public an increased understanding of the role of gender in shaping
              science and technology. By publicizing women's past achievements in computing,
              the study will also encourage women to enter an area of science in which they
              have been underrepresented.
