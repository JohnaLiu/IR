This one-year award supports a summer program abroad for U.S.
              engineering undergraduate students in aeronautical and aerospace engineering. 
              Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and
              University, and the Ecole d'Ingenieurs in Sceaux, France sponsor the program.
              U.S. and European students will study engineering practices, theory, problem
              solving and conduct site visits to several aviation and aerospace engineering
              firms, such as Dassault, Alcatel, and Renault.
This international summer
              program has several advantages.  Students at an early stage in their careers
              will develop skills needed to function in a global or multinational corporate
              environment.  U.S. and European practicing engineers and university professors
              will conduct the classes in approaches to engineering theory, quality control,
              mathematics and reasoning.
