Abstract    :
              The project submitted in response to NSF 96-145, will build on established
              activities exploring high performance mechanisms for interoperable distributed
              digital libraries. In particular, the project will draw on existing efforts
              related to the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) to demonstrate effective
              retrieval.across multiple repositories in the US and Mexico.  The project will
              test new integration of diverse systems which exemplify agent, federated
              search, and multiple database/gateway approaches to distributed processing. 
              The testbed aspect of the project aims to advance and facilitate sharing of
              research in a proven international, 
multilingual collaborative environment.
              This project is highly pluralistic and will engage researchers and students
              from universities in the US and Mexico with high potential for extension to
              other sites located around the globe.
