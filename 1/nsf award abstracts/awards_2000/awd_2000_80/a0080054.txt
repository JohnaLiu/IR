Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) is a partnership
              between the University of Oklahoma and the University of Arkansas which
              supports an interdisciplinary research program on semiconductor nanostructure
              science and applications.  The research is carried out in two interdisciplinary
              research groups, with appropriate seed projects.   Within IRG 1 the focus is on
              the growth and characterization of semiconductor nanostructures.   The IRG also
              includes study of the novel electronic and optical properties and potential
              device applications.   IRG 2 has its focus on interfaces with particular
              emphasis on the study of narrow gap semiconductors such as based on InAs and
              InSb.  The center is engaged in a number of educational activities from the
              graduate to the middle school level, including support for workshops for middle
              and high school science teachers, and support for production of science videos.
               The Center supports well maintained shared experimental facilities and also
              supports interactive efforts with industry, National Laboratories and other
              sectors.  

Participants in the Center include 17 senior investigators, 6
              postdoctoral associates, 15 graduate students, 3 undergraduates, and
              1technician.  Professor Matthew B. Johnson directs the MRSEC.
