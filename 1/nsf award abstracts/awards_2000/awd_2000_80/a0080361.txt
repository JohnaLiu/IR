This research looks at nonequilibrium alloys created in binary
              systems exhibiting a positive heat of mixing.  It builds on recent progress in
              understanding such phases alloyed in the solid state using mechanical milling.
              Several unresolved fundamental issues are identified regarding the structural
              and thermodynamic nature of alloys produced far from equilibrium. The alloys to
              be studied are amorphous phases or highly supersaturated crystalline solid
              solutions prepared through vapor quenching using a co-sputtering technique. The
              model systems include Ag-Ni, Cu-TA, Cu-Nb, Ag-Cu, Cu-Fe, and Cu-Cr.  The plan
              is to systematically study the local atomic-level structure using Extended
              X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge
              Structure (XANES) techniques. Short-range clustering or ordering tendencies and
              bond lengths are examined.  In addition to proving true atomic-level alloying,
              local environment information will be correlated with the thermodynamic states
              quantitatively determined through extensive calorimetric characterizations of
              the deposited foils.

This work will identify the reasons for the
              stability of the phases formed relative to other competitors. The similarities
              and differences for alloys obtained in the same system through different
              processing routes are also considered.  Possible decomposition and
              compositional modulations, effects on alloy energetics and stability, as well
              as competing mechanisms of spinodal decomposition versus nucleation and growth,
              will also be examined.
