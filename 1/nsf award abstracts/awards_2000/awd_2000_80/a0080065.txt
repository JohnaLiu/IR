Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the California
              Institute of Technology supports an interdisciplinary research program on
              advanced materials, as well as a wide range of educational activities,
              including outreach to minority communities in California both at the
              pre-college and college level, and development of pre-college instructional
              materials.  The Center supports well maintained shared experimental facilities
              and also supports interactive efforts with industry and other sectors.

The
              Center's research is organized into two interdisciplinary research groups
              (IRG).  IRG 1, Biological Synthesis and Assembly of Macromolecular Materials,
              uses powerful biological approaches for the synthesis and assembly of polymeric
              materials.  IRG 2, Bulk Metallic Glasses and Composites, explores new
              strategies to produce bulk metallic glasses and their composites with enhanced
              mechanical properties. The Center also provides seed support for emerging
              research opportunities in photonic and ferroelectric materials.

Participants
              in the Center currently include 18 senior investigators, 1 postdoctoral
              associate, 17 graduate students, 16 undergraduates, and 8 technicians and other
              support personnel.   Professor Julia A. Kornfield directs the MRSEC.
