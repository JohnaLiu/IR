Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at Johns Hopkins
              University supports an interdisciplinary research program on nanostructures
              with enhancd magneto-electronic properties.  The research is carried out in one
              interdisciplinary research group, with appropriate seed projects.  Within the
              IRG one thrust is on the magneto-transport properties of high quality bismuth
              thin films; another thrust is on ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic multilayers,
              and another on nanostructured half-metallic chromium oxide films; two other
              thrusts highlight electrodeposited one-dimensional structures (nanowires) and
              patterned structures such as arrays of epitaxially grown interacting chromium
              oxide dots.  The center is engaged in a variety of educational activities,
              including Research Experiences for undergraduates and Research Experiences for
              Teachers, an undergraduate fellow program and a high school teacher internship
              program.  The Center supports well maintained shared experimental facilities,
              which are accessible to outside users and also supports interactive efforts
              within industry and other sectors.

Participants in the Center include 11
              senior investigators, 4 postdoctoral associates, 8 graduate students, 10
              undergraduates, and 2 technicians and other support personnel.  Professor
              Chia-Ling Chien directs the MRSEC.
