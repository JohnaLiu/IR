Abstract    :
              The primary objective of the proposed work is to investigate critical
              development issues to enable a two-dimensional sensor network called an
              artificial sensitive skin, with embedded integrated sensors and distributed
              signal-processing network.  Specific technical objectives are summarized as
              follows.  In the area of integrated sensors, the PI plans to develop efficient
              microfabrication technology to enable modular sensors with potentially high
              integration density.  The benefit of a "skin" of multiple, distributed sensors
              can only be realized through the development and Implementation of signal
              processing architecture and algorithms.  A scale-based distributed signal
              processing architecture will be developed and implemented for two sensor
              applications - tactile sensing and flow sensing.  Integrated circuits need to
              be implemented under potentially limited and localized power supply in the
              sensor fabric. The PI proposes to develop low-power techniques for improving
              the energy efficiency of sensitive skin applications and demonstrate
              distributed error/noise tolerance techniques.
