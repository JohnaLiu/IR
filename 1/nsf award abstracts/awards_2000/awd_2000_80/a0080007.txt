Cell-cell signaling in the nervous system involves the
              regulated release of chemical neurotransmitters at specialized synaptic
              contacts. The principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain is
              glutamate. Yet the methods available to measure glutamate are indirect and
              insufficient to study its release in real time or at individual release sites.
              This proposal seeks to develop a reliable, quantitative, and direct method to
              measure the release of glutamate during synaptic transmission. Highly selective
              glutamate sensitive proteins will be employed that generate a measurable
              current upon glutamate binding. The proteins have been cloned, genetically
              engineered to enhance their fidelity of signal transduction, and will be
              incorporated into a biosensor probe. Studies are proposed to test the spatial
              and temporal limits of detection by such probes while measuring the variability
              of 'quantal' packets of glutamate, perhaps a few thousand molecules, as they
              are released during synaptic activity. If successful, these studies will
              provide a means to address previously intractable questions of synaptic
              physiology.   
Glutamate release is broadly involved in nervous system
              function and is highly regulated. Developmental and use-dependent changes in
              the strength of glutamate transmission are important for synapse maturation,
              learning and memory. Dysregulation of glutamate transmission is implicated in
              cognitive-memory impairments, epilepsy, affective disorders, and
              neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, it is important to advance our
              understanding of the process and regulation of glutamate release.
