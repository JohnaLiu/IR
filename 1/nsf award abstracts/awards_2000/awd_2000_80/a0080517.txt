This proposal will increase student participation
              at the M4 Symposium on Magnetic Materials for Magnetoelectronic Devices to be
              held May 17-18, 2000 at Iowa State University. The purpose of the symposium is
              to provide a forum for discussion and dissemination of cutting-edge research in
              the rapidly emerging area of magnetoelectronics. The symposium is planned to
              give an efficient, comprehensive view of the present and future of
              magnetoelectronics: combining both breadth and depth, both next generation and
              far-reaching research on materialsand devices. An unusually strong list of
              speakers have already agreed to make presentations. There will be no parallel
              sessions, so all participants can attend all the presentations. The target
              audience is researchers, educators and students with an interest in
              magnetoelectronic materials
and devices, from academia, government and
              industry. 

Students do not often have the opportunity to attend a symposium
              of this type. Student participants will benefit from the opportunity to get an
              overview and in-depth look at the current and future direction of the emerging
              field of magnetoelectronics. The symposium should benefit both beginning
              students, and those who have advanced experience in the area of
              magnetoelectronic devices.
