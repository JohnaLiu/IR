Abstract    :
              
A one day meeting, an East Coast Computer Algebra Day (ECCAD),
will be held
              at the University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario
on Saturday, May 13,
              2000. The meeting is the seventh of the series, 
which has been held at a
              variety of US East Coast locations since 1994. 
We expect 60-80 participants
              will be from the computer algebra 
research community or interested in
              scientific/engineering applications
 of computer algebra, drawn from the
              eastern half of North America, 
but especially from the East Coast of the
              United States. The meeting  
includes invited talks and contributed
              poster/software demo sessions, 
covering the breadth of computer algebra:
              algorithms, software, and 
applications. The organizing committee intends to
              give preference to 
funding students and recent Ph.Ds who plan to make a
              presentation at
the meeting.
