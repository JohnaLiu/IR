Cavitation is a
              ubiquitous problem in hydraulic machinary.  It often serves as the limiting
              condition for the operation of pumps, turbines, and propellars/propulsors.  An
              enhanced understanding of the causes, their relationship to the lifting surface
              geometrics, and how to minimize the adverse effects of cavitation would be of
              great benefit to these aspects of hydraulic engineering.

The PI will address
              these issues using the advanced experimental techniques which are available in
              his laboratory.  He will identify the distinction acoustic emission features of
              the cloud and the bubble cavitation regimes using coordinated and
              conditionally-sampled-photography.  Further experiments using the designated
              hydrofoil will involve identification of the periodic motions within the wake
              and the associated bubble characteristics.
