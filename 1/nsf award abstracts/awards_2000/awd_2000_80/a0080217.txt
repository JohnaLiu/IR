Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for senior and junior researchers to
              participate in a conference on the role of values in science.  The conference
              goal is to promote systematic new research on the different kinds of values
              that are involved in science, on how and where values are involved, and on the
              consequences that involvement has for science and its interpretation.  More
              specifically, the conference seeks to bring together historical and social
              science work with research in the traditional analytic philosophy of science
              and to promote discussion of the place of values in the second tradition.  Over
              thirty people have agreed to participate as speakers and session moderators;
              they include experts in history and philosophy of science, social studies of
              science, economics, cognitive neuroscience, psychology and biology.  Submitted
              papers will be solicited, and interaction promoted through a webpage and email
              discussion list.  The webpage will continue after the conference, and
              organizers will seek to publish a volume of papers.
