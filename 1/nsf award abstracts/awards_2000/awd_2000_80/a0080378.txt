Abstract    :
              Scientific understanding of human evolution in the period between 3.0 and 4.0
              million years ago is based chiefly on information derived from the Ethiopian
              site of Hadar.  Since the early 1970s paleoanthropologists now with the
              Institute of Human Origins (IHO) at Arizona State University have conducted
              nine seasons of field work at the Hadar site.  This research has yielded nearly
              350 hominid specimens, the great majority of which fall within the 3.0-3.4 Myr
              time period and are attributed to the species Australopithecus afarensis. 
              Included in the Hadar hominid sample are "Lucy," the fragmentary remains of at
              least 13 individuals at A.L. 333, and the first fairly complete skull of the
              species (A.L. 444-2). 

One of the persistent data gaps in the hominid fossil
              record lies within the period between 3.0 and 2.0 myr, a period that witnessed
              the diversification of the specialized, megadont "robust" Australopithecus
              lineage and the rise of our own, Homo.  Sediments representing this interval
              are exposed along Awash River tributaries  in both the eastern and western
              sectors of the Hadar site.  2.5-Myr Oldowan stone tools were excavated at
              localities on the edge of the Gona tributary in 1976 by H. Roche and J. Harris
              and in 1992-1993 by S. Semaw.  In 1994 the IHO team conducted field work in
              young sediments exposed along the Kada Hadar tributary and recovered a hominid
              upper jaw of Homo  aff. H. habilis (A.L. 666-1) and stone tools on the surface
              of 2.33 Myr sediments.  A small trial excavation uncovered in situ tools and
              fragmentary faunal remains.  Geological and faunal studies infer a significant
              shift toward drier, more open conditions at Hadar after 2.95 Myr, represented
              in sediments stratigraphically situated above a significant erosional event
              (so-called Major Disconformity Surface, or MDS).

The ulitmate goal the two
              year research plan is to increase the documentary evidence at Hadar concerning
              this relatively poorly known period in the human fossil record.  Excavation of
              additional localities where stone tools and bones co-occur will be accompanied
              by volcanic tephra correlation studies and paleomagnetic sampling to achieve a
              more finely resolved temporal framework for the post-MDS sequence.  In
              addition, this research plan includes further excavations at the unique A.L.
              333 A. afarensis locality, which, 20 years after its discovery, continues to
              yield hominid fossils.  Finally, reconnaissance survey of outlying areas that
              were visited briefly in the early 1970s may be undertaken.  These areas are
              known to be fossilferous and appear to lie within the critical 2.0-3.0 Myr
              range.
