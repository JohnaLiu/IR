The University of South Carolina (USC) and its partners
              have formed a South Carolina Statewide Coalition (SC2 ) to support talented
              undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in an environmental biology
              research endeavor. In partnership with several South Carolina Historically
              Black Colleges and Universities, and state agencies, this Undergraduate
              Mentoring in Environmental Biology (UMEB) project will be a key element of a
              comprehensive initiative aimed at training and preparing minority
              undergraduates for graduate programs in science and mathematics. SC2-UMEB will
              train students and their mentors in a wide range of environmental technologies
              and concepts, ranging from ecological and conservation genetics to ecosystems
              studies, and will integrate with other ongoing undergraduate training programs
              in genetics, molecular biology, ecology and evolution. The SC2-UMEB program
              will feature a course that introduces participants to environmental biology
              research, summer research experiences in academic and/or a government research
              laboratories, assistance and counsel from mentor teams (faculty, graduate
              students and other researchers), academic year research experiences at the
              students' home campuses, and financial support for travel to professional
              meetings. The project links the SC2 UMEB partners with other minority research
              collaborations (e.g., the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation
              (LSAMP) programs, the Minority Institutions of Excellence (MIE) program, the
              Preparing Future Faculty (PFF) program) across the nation, as well as the
              Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) graduate program which
              provides 25 PHD fellowships for qualified students from underrepresented groups
              wishing to pursue graduate degrees in science and mathematics at USC.
              

SC2-UMEB fellows will have the opportunity to select and engage in active
              research programs addressing basic environmental issues including genetic,
              behavioral and ecological responses to environmental change, conservation and
              restoration biology of terrestrial, coastal and marine ecosystems, and
              ecological community response to natural and anthropogenic contaminants.
