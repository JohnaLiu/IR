Abstract    :
              Systemic Research, in collaboration with Research and Evaluation Associates,
              Inc., propose to conduct a three-year CPMSA evaluative study.  The proposed
              evaluative study effort consists of four distinct deliverables:
1.  TISC data
              collection:  Collect upgraded annual TISC data (both quantitative and
              qualitative) for the next three years.
2.  Annual CPMSA Fact Book with a
              Narrative Progress Summary:  Compile and publish CPMSA Fact Books based on TISC
              with an additional section for a narrative progress summary.
3.  CPMSA Case
              Stories:  Publish exemplary CPMSA success stories based on two site visits each
              year.
4.  CPMSA Evaluative Study Report:  Publish an overall program
              evaluative study report each year focusing on causal inferential statistical
              models.
