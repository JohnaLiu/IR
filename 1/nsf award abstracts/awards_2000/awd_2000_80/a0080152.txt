Abstract    :
                 Despite widespread acceptance that organizational learning consists of a
              process of understanding new external knowledge, assimilating it and applying
              it, little is known about the details associated with the stages or with
              transitions between them. This research proposes to crystallize the concepts of
              learning structures and processes within the transitional economy of Hungary,
              building on the researchers' prior work there and elsewhere to illuminate how
              learning develops over time. 
     Phase 1 of the project will collect data
              from 400 private enterprises through structured interviews, building upon data
              collected in 1993 and 1996 that assessess organizational learning and
              absorptive capacity. In Phase 2, researchers  will conduct in-depth interviews
              with 20 firms and develop comparative case studies of five firms. The focus of
              inquiry is to examine both differences in what is learned, and differences in
              the ways firms learn and construct their knowledge bases, anticipating that at
              different times, firms will have differing learning capabilities, intentions
              and structures that will affect their learnign experiences.
