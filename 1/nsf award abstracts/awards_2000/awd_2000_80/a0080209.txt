Abstract    :
              Manufactured homes are built within and assembly plant under a controlled
              environment that provides safe and productive construction. "Manufactured
              Housing" has played a critical role in meeting the rapidly growing housing
              demand over the last 20-25 years. In spite of the growing market and need for
              efficient production, manufactured housing industry is faced with the lack of
              streamlined assembly process and the flow and utilization of materials in the
              production process.

The proposed research consists of five objectives, which
              are: (i) to develop a production process model for multisection manufactured
              housing production; (ii) to develop a process model for the material flow and
              its utilization on the assembly line; (iii) to integrate the two process models
              produced in objectives 1 and 2; (iv) to implement the integrated process model
              in a computer simulation system; and (v) to develop a dissemination and
              continuing education strategy for the industry and offer a pilot workshop in
              conjunction with industry partners.

This research will have direct influence
              on two of the four path goals related to affordability and durability/quality,
              and indirect influence on the other two goals related to energy efficiency and
              safety.
