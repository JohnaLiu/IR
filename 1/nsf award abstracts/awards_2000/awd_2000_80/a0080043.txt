Abstract    :
              Building Capacity Among Junior Researchers in the Learning Sciences: A Request
              for Special Program Support for the International Conference of the Learning
              Sciences: 2000


This is a SGER proposal to support graduate students to
              attend the International Conference on the Learning Sciences to be held in Ann
              Arbor June 14-17, 2000.  The funds would support the development of 3 workshops
              on methodology, would support junior faculty attending the meeting, and would
              provide support for graduate students to attend at a reduced price.  Also, the
              conference will hold a consortium for graduate student research at which
              students would present summaries of their research in process and receive
              comments from nationally recognized faculty.
