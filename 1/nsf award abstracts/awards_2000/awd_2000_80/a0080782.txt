              ABSTRACT

OCE-0080782

The question of the origins, composition, and
              reactivity of the dissolved organic matter that is found throughout the world
              ocean is one of central importance in chemical oceanography.  In particular,
              there has been much speculation about the possible importance of the reaction
              products of amino acids and reducing sugars (so-called amino sugars) and their
              relation to the biochemistry of marine bacteria.  In this project, researchers
              at the University of South Carolina will determine the origins, abundance, and
              composition of amino sugars in marine organisms and in particulate, colloidal,
              and dissolved organic matter.  Three component efforts will be undertaken. 
              First, the principal investigator will conduct a survey of the abundance and
              composition of amino sugars, neutral sugars, and D/L amino acids in marine
              organisms, POM, colloids, and DOM from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.  Then,
              the relative reactivities of amino and neutral sugars will be evaluated and
              compared in an assessment of their use as diagenetic (water column and sediment
              reaction) indicators.  And finally, a series of field surveys and decomposition
              studies will be used to assess the importance of bacteria as sources of amino
              sugars and DOM in seawater.
