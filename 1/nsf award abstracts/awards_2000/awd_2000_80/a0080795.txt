Abstract    :
              The foci of this research are threefold.   First, the development of synthetic
              methodology using the  Zr-catalyzed enantioselective carboalumination of
              alkenes will be carried out.  Second, the chemistry of "ate" complexes of Zr,
              Ti and other early transition metals, especially in the area of 1,2-migratory
              insertion reactions will be probed.  Third, Zr-catalyzed carbometallation and
              Pd-catalyzed cross coupling reactions will be used for the synthesis of
              carotenoids and other polyconjugated natural products.

With this renewal
              award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
              research of Dr. Ei-ichi Negishi of the Department of Chemistry at Purdue
              University.  Professor Negishi will focus his work on developing new synthetic
              methodology using organotransition metal compounds of early transition metals,
              especially zirconium and titanium.  The methodology, in turn,  will be used to
              prepare natural products having interesting biological properties.   The work
              has broader impacts for the pharmaceutical industry and for materials science. 
              Further, the project is an excellent venue for the training of graduate
              students.
