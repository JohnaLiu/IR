Abstract    :
              Sensory cells in the nose respond to odors and send signals back to the
              olfactory bulb of the brain.  These cells live for only a few weeks and, when
              they die, they are replaced by maturing cells from a germinal cell layer in the
              olfactory tissue.  The maturing cells extend their axons into the olfactory
              bulb where they replace the contacts made by the axons of the dying neuron. The
              ability of the olfactory receptor epithelium to reconstitute itself in this
              fashion is unique because neurons in other sensory systems are not replaced if
              they die.  Of particular interest is the fact that if the olfactory bulb is
              removed, the axons of maturing sensory neurons will continue to grow until they
              reach brain tissue.  They will then make synaptic contact with neurons that do
              not normally receive inputs from olfactory receptor cells.
	While this
              remarkable example of neural plasticity has been demonstrated in
              anatomical
studies, it remains unclear whether these new synaptic contacts can
              be used by the brain to support the sense of smell.  We propose to examine this
              issue by removing the olfactory bulb in neonatal rats and testing their ability
              to detect and discriminate odors when they are adults.  Operated rats will be
              trained in a precision olfactometer device to determine their odor sensitivity
              and whether they can discriminate among odors.  Behavioral results will be
              correlated with an anatomical analysis of forebrain connections originating
              from the olfactory bulb.  A positive outcome would provide evidence for a
              hitherto unrecognized ability of the brain to utilize novel information and
              translate it into conscious sensory signal
