Abstract    :
              This award is given in partial support of an ACS Symposium on "Light-Emitting,
              Light-Harvesting, and Light-Responding Organic Systems" at the ACS National
              Meeting, San Francisco, CA, March 26-31, 2000.  This symposium will address the
              fundamental issues, preparation, and applications of organic materials and
              devices.  Three major areas will be in focus:
(1)   Light-emitting materials
              and devices - photo -and electroluminescent materials for information
              technology;
(2)   Light-harvesting materials and evices - wavelength-shifting
              and photovoltaic materials and devices for new energy sources;
(3)  
              Light-responding materials and devices - nonlinear optical and photo-refractive
              materials, photoactive materials for chemical sensing and information
              technology, liquid crystals, and photonic bandgap materials.
