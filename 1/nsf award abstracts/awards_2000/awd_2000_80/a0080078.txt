This program will provide training for undergraduates in
              conservation biology through a dual mentorship model whereby two mentors, one
              from the University of Arizona and the other from a local conservation
              organization or government agency, will guide undergraduate student interns
              over a two year program. During the two summers, students will conduct both
              independent and collaborative research in conservation biology with an
              organization or agency. Student research activities will be complemented by
              academic year seminar courses in conservation biology and scientific
              methodology, and workshops in academic and professional development. The
              program will encourage students to publish their results in scholarly journals
              and to present their research at professional meetings. The program will focus
              on recruiting, training, and supporting students traditionally underrepresented
              in conservation biology.

Conservation biology is a mixture of basic and
              applied research. The next generation of conservation biologists must be
              trained to bridge the gap between academics and real world application. This
              program will provide students such valuable training and experience while
              advancing the discipline, allowing scientists to make informed decisions
              regarding the management of organisms and landscapes. By immersing students in
              a community of peers, academicians, and practitioners of conservation biology;
              by supporting their personal and professional development; and by creating a
              culturally sensitive context for their experience; the program will strive to
              increase student chances of success in pursuit of advanced education and
              careers in conservation biology.
