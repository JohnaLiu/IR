Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at the State
              University of New York Stony Brook entitled "Garcia MRSEC on Polymers at
              Engineered Interfaces" is a collaboration between SUNY Stony Brook, the City
              University of New York at Queens College and at Staton Island, the Polytechnic
              University, and North Carolina State University.  The Center has its focus the
              design of polymer properties on macroscopic and microscopic length scales
              through the precise control of interfacial structure.  The engineered
              interfaces bridge the gap between surface and bulk properties.  The goal is to
              control the surface energies via chemical means with the purpose to design new
              materials with improved performance.  Specific problems that are investigated
              include role of compatibilizers in clay/polymer blends, enhanced
              mircro-emulsification of polymers, control of nucleation in crystalline
              polymers, fractionation of DNA on chemically treated surfaces, as well as
              modeling and theoretical analyze.

The Center supports well maintained shared
              experimental facilities and also supports interactive efforts with industry and
              other sectors.  The Center has a large and effective educational outreach
              effort at the high school level,  and sizeable Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) and Research Experience for Teachers (RET) programs.  An
              annual event, the Garcia MRSEC Open House is held each December at Queens
              College.  The event attracts approximately 400 students from 10 New York area
              high schools. 

Participants in the Center currently include 12 senior
              investigators, 3 postdoctoral associates, 8 graduate students, 10 undergraduate
              students and 1 support person.  Professor Miriam Rafailovich directs the
              MRSEC.
