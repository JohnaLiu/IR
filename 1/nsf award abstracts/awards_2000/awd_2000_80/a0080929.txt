Abstract    :
              What a speaker communicates embraces both what a speaker says and what a speaker
              implicates by what is said. Linguists and philosophers of language have
              extensively studied sentences allegedly giving rise to generalized
              conversational implicatures. However, an understanding of the psychological
              processes underlying the interpretation of such sentences is currently lacking.
              This study attempts to apply well-established psycholinguistic methods to this
              new area.

We have identified three rival pragmatic processing models that
              embody features of the major competing theories. The models inspired by Gricean
              ideas are committed to a stage in processing at which a minimal proposition is
              accessed or accessible, whereas models inspired by Relevance theory deny that a
              minimal proposition needs to be retrieved unless the context is biased towards
              such an interpretation. This project proposes a series of 10 experiments, using
              both self-paced reading tasks and reading tasks during which eye-movements are
              monitored, to test the predictions of these rival models.
