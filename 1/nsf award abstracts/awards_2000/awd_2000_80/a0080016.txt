                                                      The Materials Research Science and
              Egineering Center (MRSEC) at the University of Virginia supports an
              interdisciplinary research program on nanoscopic materials design.  The group
              research explores the guided growth of epitaxial semiconductor sufaces,
              combining short-range self-assembly phenomena with long-range pattern
              definition techniques.  Techniques utilized include focused ion beam surface
              modification, nano-scaled electrochemical etching and strain field engineering.
               This will lead to the capability for definition of nanoscale semiconductor
              surface structures of arbitrary length scales and complexity, with applications
              to quantum device structures, biological templating and nanoscale
              electrochemical processes.  The Center's research is aided by extensive
              collaborations with other universities, government and industrial laboratories.
               The Center also provides seed support for emerging research opportunities in
              related areas.

The Center supports well maintained shared experimental
              facilities and also supports interactive efforts with industry and other
              sectors.  Education outreach efforts focus on developing collaborations with
              two- and four-year colleges in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and include a
              joint curriculum development effort with Longwood College, Northern Virginia
              Community College and Hampton University.

Participants in the Center
              currently include 21 senior investigators, 2 postdoctoral associates, 11
              graduate students, 6 undergraduate students and 2 technicians and other support
              personnel.  Professor Robert Hull directs the MRSEC.
