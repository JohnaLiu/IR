Abstract    :
                  This research will employ a longitudinal design with a sample of
              approximately 35 organizations and a variety of measures specifically developed
              for this study to examine the causes, nature and consequences of
              person-organizational fit. Combining qualitative and quantitative elements, the
              study will collect data from managers and others to assess organization
              culture; job applicants will complete a set of scales to measure personal
              cultural preferences and individual personality characteristics; participating
              organizations will provide abesnteeism, performance, and other organizational
              outcome data for new employees; and employees will participate in ongoing
              assessments of satisfaction with job stress, work, job involvement and
              organizational commitment.
    A new model of the person-organizational
              cultural fit process is proposed, and hypotheses derived from the model address
              a variety of main and moderating effects of culture, ndividual differences, and
              other variables. The study employs a true longitudinal design, as opposed to
              the more typical cross-sectional and quasi-longitudinal designs. It adopts an
              unusually comprehensive view of culture, considering descriptions of cultural
              elements, rewarded behaviors, and organizational metaphors, as well as measures
              of culture strength and degree of use of cultural elements. It considers
              parallel measures of organizational culture and individual culture preferences,
              and examines the potential role of a variety of key individual difference
              variables, including work values, propensity to commitment, positive affect,
              the Big-5 personality variables, and propensity to prosocial behaviors.
