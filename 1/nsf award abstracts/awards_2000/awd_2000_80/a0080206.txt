              Infrastructure:  System Support for Enterprise Application Servers

This
              proposal is for the acquisition and maintenance of a single large-scale
              shared-memory multiprocessor (SMP), and an active disk array.  The equipment
              will be used to support a broad program of research into system support for
              enterprise applications. These applications include database servers, file
              servers, multimedia servers, and "enterprise application" servers.  Though the
              group's projects include a broad range of specific activities, the overriding
              vision for the group will be a unified investigation of how to structure and
              support large-scale server applications.  The researchers will take a vertical
              approach to this problem, investigating issues at every level from the
              application down to the network protocol level.
