The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC)
              at Penn State University supports an interdisciplinary research program on
              collective phenomena in porous hosts.  The group research addresses the
              collective molecular, photonic and electronic effects that emerge in
              nanometer-scale porous systems of one-, two- and  three-dimensional
              connectivity.  Particular emphasis is placed on ordered structures with
              application to tunable photonic crystals, phase transitions in fluids, and
              electronic effects in one-dimensional wires and three-dimensional solid phase
              superlattices.  The Center also provides seed support for emerging research
              opportunities.

The Center supports well maintained shared experimental and
              computational facilities and also supports interactive efforts with industry
              and other sectors.  Comprehensive education activities range from K-12 to
              graduate education, with outreach to the public through ties to science
              museums.

Participants in the Center currently include 13 senior
              investigators, 2 postdoctoral associates, 16 graduate students and 2
              technicians and other support personnel.   Professor Moses Chan directs the
              MRSEC.
