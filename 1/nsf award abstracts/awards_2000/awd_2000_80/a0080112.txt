Abstract    :
              The majority of organisms experience life in two distinct habitats as a result
              of undergoing a metamorphosis during ontogeny.  The timing of metamorphosis is
              an ecologically important event because there are costs and benefits associated
              with the relative duration of the larval verses adult phase.  Although much is
              known about the ecological and evolutionary significance of metamorphic timing,
              very little is known about the underlying mechanisms that contribute to
              variation in metamorphic timing.  The proposed project would characterize the
              physiological genetic basis of variation in metamorphic timing using a model
              urodele system.  The salamanders to be used are crosses and back-crosses of
              Ambystoma that differ in whether they undergo metamorphosis.  These crosses,
              made with prior NSF support,  required years to develop.  This is a small award
              to maintain the salamander colony for a year, while the proposal for the
              research project is revised and resubmitted.
