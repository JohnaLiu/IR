Nonlinear non-stationary large-scale systems such as
              electric power networks, telecommunication networks, financial and
              transportation systems are difficult to control and manage.  Mathematical
              models of such systems are typically derived based on linear techniques, and
              wide margins of safety ensure stable operation.  Advanced identification and
              control schemes are necessary in order to improve the
              throughput-versus-reliability tradeoff of such systems.

Preliminary work by
              these PIs has shown that advanced, value-based control methods can
              substantially improve the ability of individual turbogenerators to tolerate
              unexpected system disturbances.  This project will extend that work to
              distributed networks of power generators and power grids in general.  The
              underlying technology is an advanced form of learning-based Approximate Dynamic
              Programming or "Reinforcement Learning" which outputs measures of value for
              individual variables, or dynamic "shadow prices," rather than the conventional
              measures of global strategic utility.  Success in this area may also have
              benefits for other domains where distributed control and distributed
              intelligence are needed.
