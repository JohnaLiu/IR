Abstract    :
              Light-dependent chloroplast movements have been observed in many 
plants
              including algae, moss, ferns, and angiosperms.  These 
chloroplast movements
              have been hypothesized to serve adaptive 
functions such that movement of
              chloroplasts to the upper and lower 
surfaces of cells in low light may
              improve light capture, whereas 
chloroplast movement to the sides of cells may
              protect them from 
photodamage.  The experiments outlined in this proposal
              incorporate a 
combination of genetic, molecular and physiological approaches
              to 
understand the mechanism of chloroplast movements and to test the
              
hypothesized adaptive significance.  The proposed work is expected to 
lead
              to the identification of the photoreceptor system(s) for 
light-induced
              chloroplast movement, elucidate the motility 
mechanism(s) responsible for the
              movement, provide insights into the 
nature of the signal transduction
              pathway, and allow us to determine 
the functional significance of chloroplast
              movements during plant 
growth and development.  Understanding how
              light-induced chloroplast 
movements impact photosynthetic potential could
              lead to agricultural 
applications. In addition to the training of one
              postdoctoral fellow 
and two graduate students during the award period, the
              participation 
of several undergraduate students throughout this project is
              also 
anticipated.
