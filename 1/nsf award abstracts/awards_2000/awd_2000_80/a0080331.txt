Abstract    :
                   This Small Grant for Exploratory Research project proposes to investigate
              the innovation patterns associated with the evolution of thirteen complex
              technologies carried out by organizational networks centered in six different
              countries. It seeks iinsight into the influence of different national cultures
              on the innovation processes that produce new or enhanced complex product and
              process technologies, building on prior research that developed a model of
              complex technology change. Six case studies of complex technology, paralleling
              earlier work, will be carried out, structured by a trajectory framework
              developed previously. The framework reflects evidence that the innovation
              processes that produce complex technologies manifest three distinct innovation
              patterns. The proposal will support the PI and a graduate student in carrying
              out initial round interviews in six countries to determine whether a major
              research effort is warranted.
