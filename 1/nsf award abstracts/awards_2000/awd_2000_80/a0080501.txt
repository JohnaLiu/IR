This project is a national conference on the teaching of
              evolution.  It will consider ways in which scientific, educational, and other
              interested professional organizations can work together to improve the quality
              of and accessibility to materials that support the teaching of evolution.  The
              meeting will be held at the University of California Museum of Paleontology in
              Berkeley and focus on developing an action plan to ensure that evolutionary
              principles are taught in pre-college, college, and teacher-preparation
              classrooms as well as in the informal science environment.  

Evolution is
              not an esoteric concept, but rather the unifying concept in biology.  It
              affects our lives in countless ways, from the food we eat to our view of
              health.  There remain grave misunderstandings about evolution among both
              teachers and the general public.  This is of great concern to scientists and
              educators alike.  There is a need for further support and professional
              development for teachers on the nature of science, the patterns and processes
              of evolution, and classroom strategies.  The problem is a complex one and its
              solution requires a united and proactive effort by the scientific community. 
              We cannot hope to develop strategies to enhance the delivery of evolution
              education without involving all constituencies with a vested interest in
              science education.
