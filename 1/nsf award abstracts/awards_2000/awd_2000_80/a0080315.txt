Abstract    :
              This project will develop educational information technology and use it to
              launch a curriculum in
information technology and E-business. The educational
              information technology will focus on providing freely available,
              not-domain-specific, tools for instructors, students, and professionals to
              create and access integrated curriculums online, with mechanisms to enhance
              students' critical-thinking skills. A sequence of courses and set of
              educational material, suitable for both major and non-major students, will be
              developed to lay the foundation for a substantial curriculum in information
              technology.  The courses developed will span a variety of areas in information
              Technology and E-business, and is expected to ultimately lead to a new graduate
              program in information engineering.  Researchers from several information
              engineering and E-business domains will generate the educational material.
