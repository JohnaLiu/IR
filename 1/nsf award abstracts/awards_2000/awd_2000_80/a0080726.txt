The 2000 Meeting of the Interciencia Association will
              provide representative from scientific organizations in 20 countries of the
              Western Hemisphere with the opportunity to meet and discuss their latest
              achievements and possible collaborative work.  This event will also support the
              participation of these representatives in the next Annual Meeting of the
              American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), in Washington, DC. 
              The AAAS Annual Meeting will be the premier scientific event in the US during
              the year 2000.  Principal outcomes of the proposed activities would be both
              valuable personal interactions with international scientists and science
              reporters and an increased visibility for the Interciencia Association and its
              scientific journal.  Recognizing that these activities would represent a
              significant contribution to scientific collaboration in the Americas, AAAS and
              the Organization of American States (OAS) have already made a significant
              financial commitment to support the event.
