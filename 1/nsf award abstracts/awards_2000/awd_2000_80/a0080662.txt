Abstract    :
              This project proposes to develop, improve, test and evaluate GRE (Graduate
              Record Exam) preparatory courses for SMET majors at five women's college's in
              partnership with the graduate school that developed the SMART GRE Prep course
              as a component of a NSF MPWG.  The sites will use material from this successful
              course, but provide new materials and approaches to test the course in a
              variety of contexts. Partners include The Graduate School of Baylor College of
              Medicine and Wesleyan College.  The project will directly serve more than 650
              SMET students.  The courses will use standardize diagnostic and exit exams to
              compare results of different models and test successful components at different
              sites in years two and three.  Course guidebooks will be developed and
              information regarding models will be disseminated to other women's colleges and
              those with an interest in securing opportunities for women to pursue advances
              SMET degrees.  This Large Collaborative Project will provide  information for
              campuses to improve graduate school opportunities for thousands of US women,
              SMET majors and impact undergraduate students, faculty and graduate student
              mentors, and faculty and staff who develop expertise in teaching skills
              assessed on the GRE.
