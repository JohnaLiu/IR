The objective of this project is to advance understanding of
              how certain brain cells communicate in order to process sensation from the
              viscera (i.e., the stomach, lungs, heart, etc.).  Sensory nerves in the viscera
              communicate directly with a set of brain cells, which are called neurons, in a
              small region of the lower part of the brainstem.  These brainstem neurons
              communicate with each other to integrate digestive, cardiovascular and other
              autonomic functions.  A number of chemicals made in other brain regions help
              regulate this communication, including a newly discovered brain chemical called
              hypocretin, which acts within the brain to generally increase autonomic
              behaviors. The general hypothesis of this project is that hypocretin modifies
              specific types of neuronal communication within the brainstem in a manner
              consistent with the chemical's effects on autonomic function.  Using
              state-of-the-art electrical recording and optical imaging methods to study
              neuronal communication and anatomy, the functional organization of the
              viscera-related part of the brainstem will be determined, and the effects of
              hypocretin on that circuitry will be examined in the context of the chemical's
              reported general excitatory characteristics. 

	Results of these experiments
              will lead to a better understanding of how neurons in the brainstem communicate
              with each other, as well as how chemical input from other brain areas can
              influence this communication.   In addition, the results will help scientists
              better understand how neurons communicate with each other in general, and how
              various aspects of visceral function might be modified by chemicals acting
              within the brainstem.
