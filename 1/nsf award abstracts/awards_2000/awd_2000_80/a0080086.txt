This grant provides partial support for the acquisition of a
              noble gas mass spectrometer, a UV/IR dual laser system, high precision furnace,
              and associated vacuum equipment and electronics to construct a facility for
              40Ar/39Ar geochronology and rare gas geochemical investigations at the
              University of Florida.  The lead PI, David Foster recently (1998) joined the
              faculty at the University of Florida after spending several years as a senior
              researcher at La Trobe University in Australia.  He joins Paul Mueller, Michael
              Perfit and Ann Heatherington in the geochemistry and petrology group. 
              Establishment of a thermochronology facility at Florida will complement
              existing and successfully operated geochemical instrumentation in the Geology
              Department including a TIMS, ICP-MS and SIRMS and will add capacity to a
              limited U.S. geoscience analytical infrastructure for Ar/Ar geochronology.  The
              noble gas mass spectrometer will facilitate research in tectonics, economic
              geology, basin studies, geomorphology and anthropology by providing for
              constraints on the timing and rates of geologic processes.
