The functioning of the nervous system depends on an intricate
              
network of connections between cells.  Much of the communication 
occurs at
              tiny physical contacts between cells called synapses.  How 
molecular
              components of synapses come to be organized together is an 
important problem
              within neuroscience.  The current project will 
examine how influences from
              motor neurons direct the localization of 
synaptic molecules on muscle cells. 
              It is hypothesized that calcium 
channels on the muscle cells mediate the
              signaling from the neurons 
and that local entry of calcium through these
              channels directs the 
local accumulation of synaptic molecules.  In order to
              test this 
hypothesis, muscle cells in tissue culture will be stimulated with
              
signaling molecules derived from neurons, and the calcium channels 
will be
              manipulated with pharmacological agents.  Both local calcium 
entry and the
              local accumulation of synaptic molecules will be 
assayed. 
    The results
              of the proposed work will further our understanding of 
the molecular
              signaling mechanisms that control the formation, 
maintenance, and modulation
              of synapses.   Synapses provide the 
nervous system with something akin to
              what transistors provide 
computers, pathways of communication that can be
              modulated to obtain 
different results.  As such, an understanding of how
              synapses can be 
modulated has profound implications for learning and
              memory.
