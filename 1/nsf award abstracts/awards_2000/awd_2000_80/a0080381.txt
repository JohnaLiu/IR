Abstract    :
              The Virginia coast is an extremely dynamic landscape. The Virginia Coastal
              Reserve (VCR) LTER focuses on understanding the relationships between natural
              and anthropogenic forces on the ecology of a coastal barrier island, lagoon and
              mainland system. Frequent storms, tides, and winds cause sea level variations
              that affect over 70% of VCR's land area. Over the last century sea level rose
              35 cm, the highest rise along the Atlantic coast. Seventy years ago the
              dominant species, eelgrass, disappeared from the lagoons; recolonization began
              anew in the past 5 years. In addition, 60-90% of the barrier island uplands is
              new land since 1979. This land creation has left a century-long legacy that we
              can now use for natural experiments. 

The central hypothesis of the new
              phase of the VCR LTER program is that ecosystem and landscape dynamics and land
              use patterns within the watersheds of the VCR are controlled by the vertical
              position of the land, the sea, and the freshwater table surfaces. Our research
              approach is to utilize short-term manipulative experiments, long-term
              observations, and computer models. We will also capitalize on nature's
              "experiments" where new landscapes continue to be created and recolonizing
              species may be moving lagoons back to conditions of earlier times.  We will
              also expand our research to examine 56 watersheds on the peninsula, which
              currently vary in cover from 80% forest to 80% agriculture. This research goes
              to the heart of solving fundamental societal problems associated with
              environmental change at the land-sea interface.
