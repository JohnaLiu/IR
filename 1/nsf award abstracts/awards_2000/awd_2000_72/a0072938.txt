The University of Rhode Island will operate the R/V Endeavor
              during 2000 as a general oceanographic research vessel in support of
              NSF-supported research projects.  The Endeavor is a 184 ft. vessel, constructed
              in 1976  with a midlife in 1993, and is owned by the National Science
              Foundation and operated by the University of Rhode Island.  The vessel is
              scheduled for a total of 211 operational days during 2000, of which 100 days
              are in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining cruises will
              support Navy, NOAA, and USGS projects.  The projects scheduled on the Endeavor
              represent several oceanographic disciplines, and includes instrument testing,
              mooring deployments and recoveries, plankton studies, and chemical
              oceanography, and will fully utilize the capabilities of the vessel. Operations
              in 2000 will mainly take place in the North Atlantic, from the Gulf of Maine to
              as far south as the coast off of Atlantic City.

The Endeavor is part of a
              fleet of ships used by the National Science Foundation in support of marine
              science research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized
              equipment to be permanently installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for
              specialized ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same mode as general
              cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of
              ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by
              universities and institutions around the country.
