Abstract    :
              0072845

The Institute of International Education (IIE) seeks funding to
              assess its Global E3 program, a network of more than 75 universities in 14
              countries that has explored barriers that have prevented US undergraduate
              engineering students from going abroad during their academic careers.  During
              its first five years, more than 160 students and over 200 international
              students have participated in the program through academic study abroad and
              overseas internships.  The number of participants continues to almost double
              annually.  IIE is proposing a follow-up study to track Global E3 US alumni to
              learn what added value their experience abroad has brought to their careers and
              to their employers.  The resulting outcomes data will enable IIE to document
              the program's impact on its alumni that will encourage private sector
              partnership and participation in the Global E3 program and provide partial
              scholarships for US students who engage in research or internships overseas. 
              This effort will maximize the value of NSF's earlier investment in Global E3
              and contribute to the program's long-term sustainability.
