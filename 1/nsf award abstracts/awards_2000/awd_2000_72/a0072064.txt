This US-Brazil award provides support for cooperative research
              among Dr. Vojtech Rodl, Dwight A. Duffus, and Jozef Skokan of Emory University,
              Dr. Brendan Nagle of Georgia Tech, Dr. Lubos Thoma of Carnegie Mellon and
              Professor Associado Yoshiharu Kohayakawa of the Universidade de Sao Paulo.  The
              U.S. researchers will be provided with travel support to work with Dr.
              Kohayakawa in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Dr. Kohayakawa has visited Emory University
              frequently, but this award will permit the U.S. researchers to continue the
              collaboration by going to Brazil.  They will work on two sets of problems: the
              first group center on the recently developed methodology involving Szemeredi's
              Regularity Lemma, a sparse regularity lemma, and versions of the Blow-up Lemma.
               The second group deals with external properties for finite set systems.
