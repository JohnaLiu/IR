The tendency of molecules of liquid crystal to adopt a
              particular orientation at a surface is known as anchoring.  This phenomenon is
              at the heart of liquid crystal display devices.  The research objective of this
              grant is to explore the physical conditions necessary for a specific
              orientation of the adsorbed liquid crystal molecule.  Atomistic molecular
              dynamics simulation will be used to study the anchoring of a liquid crystal
              (initially nematogen 5 CB) at various polymer surfaces.  The outcome of these
              simulations will be compared with some analytical theories of the dynamics of
              tethered molecules.  In particular, the studies will try to answer: (1) What is
              the relative importance of the microscopic chain orientation of the polymer
              molecules in the substrate surface, in comparison to the macroscopic surface
              morphology? (2) What role do the thermal vibrations of the substrate play ion
              the anchoring? (3) What is the effect of the electric dipoles in determining
              the molecular orientation at the surface, and, finally (4) What role does the
              flexible part of the mesogen play in anchoring.

In the liquid crystal
              display devices, an important physical phenomenon is anchoring.  This refers to
              the tendency of the liquid crystal molecule, while adsorbed on a surface, to
              select a specific orientation depending on its physical environment.  This
              grant supports research to study the factors which influence the selection of
              this orientation.  The work in carried out using molecular dynamics simulations
              using high-speed computers.
