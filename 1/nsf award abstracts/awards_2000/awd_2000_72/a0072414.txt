Abstract    :
              The focus of the research supported by this award is the
mathematical analysis
              of certain significant material failures in
solids.  The goal of this endeavor
              is the qualitative prediction of
the formation and growth of voids.  Toward
              this end the principal
investigator will continue his studies of the relevant
              nonlinear
partial differential equations, which constitute the
              mathematical
model, in order to determine conditions under which these
              problems
have singular solutions.  The underlying equations are those
              that
arise in elasticity and viscoelasticity and the desired
singularities
              are point discontinuities.  Problems that will be
considered include:  the
              existence of singular solutions to
quasilinear elliptic systems; the existence
              of, and admissibility
criteria for, singular solutions to hyperbolic systems;
              the
existence of singular solutions to certain parabolic systems;
              the
existence of minimizers with singularities for problems in the
calculus
              of variations; regularity, fine properties, and the
asymptotic behavior of
              singular minimizers; the optimal location
for an isolated singularity; and,
              the determination of whether
known singular solutions to a quasilinear
              elliptic system are
indeed minimizers of the corresponding problem in the
              calculus of
variations.

The research area of this grant is the mathematical
              analysis of
equations that arise in Materials Science.  The most common way
              to
determine when a material will fail under the influence of external
forces
              is to subject a piece of the actual material to tensile
loads until failure
              occurs, i.e., "pull on it until it breaks".
This is fine if one is interested
              only in the gross properties of
the material.  However, if one wants to
              understand the reasons for
material failure then one must have recourse to
              mathematical models
of the material.  Experiments on certain rubbery polymers,
              called
elastomers, have shown that when one pulls on an elastomer small
holes
              appear in the material.  These holes then grow in size and
combine to form
              cracks.  A similar phenomenon has been observed in
optical fibers. 
              Catastrophic failure, due to a series of holes
that cascade down the core of
              the fiber, can occur when excessive
power is applied.  These holes seriously
              degrade the ability of the
fiber to transmit information.  In this grant, the
              principal
investigator will uncover the mechanisms that cause the
              creation
and growth of holes in polymers and glasses by examining systems
              of
partial differential equations from the theory of elasticity
              and
viscoelasticity.
