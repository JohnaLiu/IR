	The physics program funded by this grant is directed at the
              
study of the electroweak and strong interactions.  Technically, the program
              focuses on the use of polarized electron beams scattering off polarized and
              unpolarized targets.  The experiments take place at the Jefferson Laboratory in
              Viriginia and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in California.  
              
	At SLAC, the fixed target program is presently devoted to a precision test
              of the electroweak theory.  By scattering polarized electrons at high energies
              off unpolarized electrons in a liquid hydrogen target, we are able to perform a
              precision test of the electroweak mixing angle in a new energy range.  The
              results from this experiment will be sensitive to the existence of new
              particles and new interactions.  At Jefferson Lab, the fixed target program is
              focused on the scattering of polarized electrons by polarized 
helium-3 in
              order to learn information on the internal spin structure of the neutron. 
              Measurements of the neutron spin structure function over a wide range of
              energies allows for tests of fundamental strong interaction sum rules and
              provides details on the quark contribution to the neutron's spin.
