The project concerns acquisition of enhanced
              instrumentation for experimental studies of polymeric systems, including bulk
              polymers, polymer matrix composites, thin films, foams, gels, and pastes. The
              set of three complementary instruments, manufactured by the TA Instruments,
              Inc., comprises: 
Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer DMA 2980
Rheometer AR
              1000N
Dielectric Analyzer DEA 2970.
These instruments provide unparalleled
              experimental capabilities in terms of high precision measurements over a broad
              range of loading and temperature conditions. The instruments will enhance the
              ongoing fundamental research at Montana State University in the area of
              advanced materials. Integration of this instrumentation into course curricula
              will enhance student learning and will provide exciting opportunities for
              graduate and undergraduate research. In addition, this instrumentation will
              serve as a catalyst for interdisciplinary collaborative research initiatives
              between Montana State University, other universities, government laboratories
              and private sector.
