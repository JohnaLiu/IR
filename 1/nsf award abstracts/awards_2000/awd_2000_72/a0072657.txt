Abstract    :
              China has about 2,500 species of mosses, about 20% of all the mosses known in
              the world, and has the richest and most diverse moss flora in the Northern
              Temperate Zone.  Despite its size and diversity, there is little information
              about this flora available outside China.  The Moss Flora of China is a
              collaborative international program organized by the Missouri Botanical Garden
              and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  The project will continue to publish the
              remaining volumes dealing with the basic, authoritative, and up to date
              information on the names, relationships, characteristics, and the geographical
              distribution of species.  The project will eventually produce eight printed
              volumes, a hypertext version on CD-ROM, and a variety of on line computerized
              information services on the web.
