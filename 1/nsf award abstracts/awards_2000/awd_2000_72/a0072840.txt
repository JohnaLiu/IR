Abstract    :
              This project focuses on three  research areas related to complex data.
The
              first research area is on high dimensional graphics, data analysis
and related
              topics.  The second research area is on mixture models and
bump hunting 
              problems.  The third  area is on models  and inferential
procedures  for data 
              with  biases.  Several  variants of  likelihood,
semi-parametric and 
              iterative procedures are sought  for modeling and
making inferences about the
              data.

We live in the information  age.  Information often hides in data
              sets
with different  appearances.  Mining and modeling  (massive) data
              sets
include the  discovery of  patterns, subcomponents, bumps,  or
              special
events, and  development of models  that explain the data  and
              predict
the future.   This research  is aimed at  providing solutions  to
              some
interesting  problems arising  from  the data  which  are either 
              high
dimension,  or  complicated,  or  with  a  sampling  bias.  
              Theories,
methods,   and  efficient  computing   algorithms  are   explored 
              for
extracting  useful  information from  the  complex data.  
              Application
areas  include  astronomy, neurosciences,  quality  control, and 
              some
(other) observational studies.
