Abstract    :
              This award is for the partial support of a conference in two areas of Nonlinear
              Analysis: Calculus of Variations and Bifurcation and Degree Theory. The
              conference will concentrate on the discussion of application of classical
              methods of the calculus of variations to new problems and on further
              development of relatively new methods such as Floer theory or Leray-Shauder
              degree for non-continuous maps. The conference will have a significant impact
              on the development of the field and will be beneficial to the mathematical
              community. I strongly recommend the award.
