              Abstract:

This project aims to develop theoretical ideas in mathematical
              statistics and probability that will be of genuine use to scientific
              practitioners.  The current proposal concerns five major projects: a detailed
              look at Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, in particular the eigenvalue theory
              that determines rates of convergence; the application of MCMC theory to
              truncated data; inferential theory for scatterplot smoothers, including the
              relative efficiencies of competing criteria adaptively selecting the "window
              width" of the smoother, and also the cost of adaptation on the accuracy of the
              smoother; random matrix theory and its connection with the zeros of Riemann's
              zeta function; and finally conversion curve methods for improving the accuracy
              of bootstrap confidence intervals.  The connecting theme for the five projects
              is the combination of mathematical theory with computer-intensive algorithms.
