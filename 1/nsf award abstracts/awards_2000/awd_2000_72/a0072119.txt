Abstract    :
              Solving many important problems in science and engineering depends on
              efficiently solving sparse linear systems, that is, sets of equations with many
              zero entries in the coefficients. This project will study techniques for
              creating sparse linear solvers that make efficient use of the memory hierarcy
              on single processor computers. It will concentrate on methods that reformulate
              the original system as a blocked system, with careful choices of the blocks to
              speed up convergence. Performance programming techniques will reduce the costs
              of the extra matrix-vector operations needed by the blocked version.

There
              are three technical goals of this work. The first is to contribute to the
              understanding of the numerical behavior of memory-efficient sparse linear
              solvers through analysis and experiment. The second is to identify at least one
              robust, memory-efficient sparse linear solver for inclusion in the Portable
              Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc) library. The final goal
              is to develop a memory-centric performance metric for evaluating the memory
              traffic requirements of linear algebra algorithms.
