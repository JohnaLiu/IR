Abstract    :
              An experiment will be carried out at the NIST reactor cold neutron facility
              aimed at improving the current limits on time reversal invariance of particle
              interactions.  The experiment is based on the beta-decay of polarized neutrons.
               Time reversal violation is a very important topic and of great current
              interest because it impacts, centrally, the question of how the universe
              evolved to contain a huge preponderance of matter over anti-matter.  A second
              experiment will be carried out at Los Alamos using a cold, polarized neutron
              beam to study the weak interaction between neutrons and protons in the capture
              process leading to deuterium.  This measurement will place limits on the parity
              violating parts of the nucleon-nucleon force.  In addition, this apparatus will
              be used in a neutron-electron scattering experiment designed to measure the
              neutron charge radius.  Other development work will be carried out in laser
              optical pumping as connected with the production of polarized neutrons and
              nuclei, including radioactive species.  Graduate student and postdocs are
              integral to the proposed research activities.
