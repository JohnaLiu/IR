Abstract    :
              This study will provide baseline knowledge on newly discovered endosymbiotic
              associations between saccharomycetalean yeasts and basidiocarp-dwelling
              beetles.  Preliminary data suggests that these beetles use fungus to eat fungi.
               Basidiocarps to be examined are the spore-containing structures of agarics and
              polypores.  The project will focus on collecting and characterizing species of
              yeasts and associated fungus-feeding beetles from along an east-west transect
              along the gulf coastal plain of the US, Pacific coastal regions of Mexico, and
              Barro Colorado, Panama.  Yeasts will be cultured and DNA extracted for
              identification.  Beetles will be examined for the site of endosymbiont
              localization and identified.  Basidocarp specimens will serve as vouchers for
              the insect collections and yeast isolations.
