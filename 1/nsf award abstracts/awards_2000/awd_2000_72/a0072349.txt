Let G be an arbitrary discrete group.  Jones and
              Farrell 
have conjectured ("Isomorphism Conjectures") that the 
surgery
              L-groups of G, L(G), and the algebraic K-groups 
of the integral group ring
              Z(G), K(Z(G)), should be 
computable in a simple way from the collections of
              all 
the groups L(H), K(Z(H)) where H is any cyclic by finite 
subgroup of G.
               The truth of these conjecutures would 
imply rigidity results for aspherical
              manifolds 
("Borel Conjecture") and also would yield much information 
about
              the spaces of homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms 
of aspherical manifolds. 
              Jones,in collaboration with Farrell, 
is trying to verify the isomorphism
              conjectures for any group 
G which acts properly discontinuously via
              isometries on a 
complete Riemannian manifold having non-positive curvature. 
              
 	
Modern day geometers and topologists are concerned with 
"spaces" and
              what they look like.  The surface of a donut, 
the sphere and the plane are
              examples of 2-dimensional 
spaces which are all different from one another
              from both 
the perspective of geometry and topology.  One way that
              
topologists study spaces (not just of dimension 2 but of
higher dimension
              also) is to associate to each space some 
algebraic gadgets.  It is
              conjectured that for many 
interesting spaces these algebraic gadgets act like
               
a "genetic code" for the space, in that they tell us 
most everything we
              want to know about the space.  Thus 
there are two fundamental problems here:
              to verify this 
"genetic code conjecture"; and to decifer the genetic code
              
for the spaces which are of interest to geometers and topologists.
