Abstract    :
              Rotaxantated polymers will be examined with a variety of analytical techniques
              to establish structure/mobility/property relationships for this class of
              materials.  Two types of polyrotaxanes are described based on very different
              macrocyclic components: (1) crown ethers, and (2) cyclodextrins.  In
              crown-ether-based rotaxanated polymers, the macrocycle is typically more mobile
              than the host backbone.  In cyclodextrin-based rotaxanated polymers, the
              macrocycles form rigid hydrogen-bonded tunnels inside which the linear polymer
              backbones can exhibit greater mobility than when not threaded.  The
              consequences of these dynamic architectures on bulk physical properties will be
              explored and compared.  In particular, impact strength and microphase
              separation will be investigated for a series of crown-ether-based rotaxanated
              polymers as a function of macrocycle loading.  Two novel constructions will be
              prepared and evaluated from the rotaxanation of linear polymers with
              cyclodextrins: (1) articulated structures of rotaxanated and nonrotaxanated
              chain segments, and (2) threaded crosslinking.  Thermal and mechanical
              properties will be correlated with information on solid-state dynamics and
              phase structures obtained through solid-state NMR, x-ray scattering, and
              electron microscopy.

This research is in the area of characterization of
              novel polymeric and organic materials.
