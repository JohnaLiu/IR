CISE Postdoctoral
              Associates in Experimental Computer Science: Verifying
Implementations of
              Model Checking Algorithms

Model checkers are starting to have a profound
              impact on the design of
computer systems, both hardware and software.  They
              have demonstrated an
ability not only of discovering deep bugs in systems that
              traditional
testing methods could not discover, but also of demonstrating
              the
correctness of designs and implementations.  However, in order to
              be
increasingly effective, model checkers have been increasing in
              complexity,
and now are themselves becoming susceptible to buggy
              implementations, and
hence contain serious soundness defects.  The
              postdoctoral associate will
develop methods for ensuring that complex
              implementations of model checkers
are sound, and hence able to be used with
              confidence.  He or she will
analyze the key implementation techniques that
              underlie modern model
checking algorithms, such as those used to implement
              Binary Decision
Diagram (BDD) algorithms, and develop a formal
              (machine-checked) theory of
these implementation strategies.  The theory will
              be used to verify the
correctness of the corresponding BDD algorithms.
