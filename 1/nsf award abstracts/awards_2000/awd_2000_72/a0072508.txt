The Gromov-Witten invariants of a compact
              symplectic 
manifold are the correlation functions of a 
two-dimensional
              topological gravity with background V. 
These invariants generalize such
              enumerative invariants 
of algebraic geometry as the number of curves of genus
              g 
and degree d through 3d+g-1 points in the plane.  For each 
genus g, the
              genus g Gromov-Witten potential of V is the 
generating function of the genus
              g Gromov-Witten invariants.  
This project intends to study the differential
              equations
satisfied by these potentials and their geometric significance. 
              
The genus zero Gromov-Witten potential satisfies
              the
Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde equation, which finds 
its geometric
              form in Dubrovin's theory of Frobenius manifolds.  Previous work of the PI has
              shown that the genus one 
Gromov-Witten potential satisfies a differential
              equation 
defined on any Frobenius manifold.  Moreover, Dubrovin and
Zhang
              have shown that this equation has a unique solution 
for any semisimple
              Frobenius manifold.  The PI proposes to 
investigate analogous situation for
              genus g greater than 
one and its manifold consequences.

It is well known
              that there is one line through two points 
in the plane.  Similarly, there is
              one quadratic curve through 
three points in the plane.  The theory of
              Gromov-Witten 
invariants is a tremendous generalization of this: one
              
generalizes from lines to general algebraic curves, and 
from the plane to
              more general spaces. The resulting counting 
problems are related to the
              theory of such integrable systems 
as the Kortweg-de Vrijs equation describing
              waves in shallow 
water. In this project, following ideas of Dubrovin and
              Zhang, 
we attempt to understand this link better.  Thus, this
project
              investigates significant and surprising developments 
in enumerative geometry
              that were originally motivated physics, 
and potentially should cast light on
              a number of questions of 
relevance to modern physics.
