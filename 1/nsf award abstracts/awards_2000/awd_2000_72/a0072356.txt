The principal investigator plans to
              work on
 a general theory of dimension called
the extension dimension. In
              this theory, dim(X) is not a natural number.
Instead, dim(X) is a CW complex
              and dim(X) being at most K
means that K is an absolute extensor of X. In
              particular,
dim(X) being at most the n-sphere is equivalent to the covering
              dimension
of X being at most n. dim(X)=K means that K
is minimal with respect
              to all L such that dim(X) is at most L.
It turns out that infinite symmetric
              products play a crucial role
in the whole theory. Their properties lead to a
              natural algebra
with self-duality. That self-duality is an algebraic
              manifestation
of the geometric duality between compact spaces and CW
              complexes.
All infinite symmetric products equivalent to compact
or
              finite-dimensional CW complexes are classified.

In classical dimension
              theory one tries to attach
a natural number n (or infinity) to every
              space.
It turns out that the natural number n is simply a substitute
for the
              n-sphere and saying that dim(X) is at most n reflects
a certain relationship
              between the space X and the n-sphere.
One can generalize the notion of
              dimension by considering
the same relationship between the space X and a
              polyhedron K
and that is stated as "dimension of X is at most K". For example,
              one can
investigate if the dimension of X is at most the projective plane.
It
              turns out that the dimension theory constructed that way
is much closely
              connected to the mainstream of topology.
In particular, one gets links to
              homological algebra
and algebraic topology. One of the most interesting
              aspects of
that theory is duality, a fundamental idea in the whole
              of
mathematics. At the simplest level it means that not only
are we trying to
              attach dimension (a polyhedron) to a space,
but also we attach a space to a
              dimension.
