Abstract    :
              New, comprehensive collections of marine macrofauna will be made at hydrothermal
              vents on Gorda Ridge, a geographically isolated Northeast Pacific ridge that
              has been subject to local extinctions, and at deep cold seeps on the Monterey
              Fan Valley system.  Collections of invertebrates from the Gorda Ridge vents and
              from cold seeps, chemically similar areas where taxa depend on reduced fluids
              released independent of hydrothermal vents to sustain chemosynthesis, will
              document the species present, their level of habitat restriction and assess how
              physical differences among these habitats affect species diversity.  The
              isolation of Gorda Ridge vents from other North Pacific vents by a 350 km
              offset suggests that their fauna may be distinct; the contrast between the
              sedimented southern and the rocky northern vents on this ridge heightens the
              scientific benefit to be derived from these collections.  A guide to the
              identification of North Pacific vent and seep taxa will be made available on
              the web and on a CD-ROM.
