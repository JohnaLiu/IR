Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposed research is to discover the diversity of Costa
              Rican fungi that attack and consume nematodes.  The nematode-destroying fungi
              are an ecologically and potentially economically important group of fungi that
              regulate numbers of free-living, plant-parasitic, and animal-parasitic
              nematodes in nature.  At present, approximately 300 species of
              nematode-destroying fungi have been described world-wide.  The only published
              study for Costa Rica, however, lists only 3 species from two soil samples.  The
              project will be focused on sampling and isolating nematode-destroying fungi
              from soils collected from a diverse array of natural and cultivated habitats in
              Costa Rica in conjunction with the Costa Rican National Biodiversity Institute
              (INBio).  Much of the sampling and isolation will be conducted by Costa Rican
              researchers following training by the principal investigators.  Products of the
              proposed research will include a published and web-based descriptive manual and
              interactive identification system to all taxa encountered in the study.
