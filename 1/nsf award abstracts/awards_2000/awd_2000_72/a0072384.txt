This is a proposal to investigate the internal structure
              and
dynamics of the neutron and of the lightest nuclei in nature,
deuterium
              and helium.  The investigation will be based on
experimental studies of high
              energy electrons scattering off
hydrogen and helium isotopes.  The proposed
              research will use the
electron beam of the Jefferson Lab accelerator to
              bombard cryogenic
deuterium and helium targets and to study the nuclear
              reaction
products with superconducting magnetic spectrometers.  The
              results
are expected to provide fundamental information on the
              distributions
of the three quark constituents of the neutron, the wave
              functions
of deuterium and helium and the interaction of the proton
              and
neutron constituents of the two light nuclei.
