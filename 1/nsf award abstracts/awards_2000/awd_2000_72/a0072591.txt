              Anderson

Anderson and LeBrun both plan to study the global
              Riemannian
geometry of low-dimensional manifolds, with an eye towards
              the
ramifications of these results for smooth topology, algebraic
geometry,
              and theoretical physics. Anderson will continue work on
Thurston's
              geometrization conjecture, and study relations of this
conjecture with global
              existence and singularity formation for
vacuum space-times in general
              relativity. LeBrun will study
relations between properties of the total scalar
              curvature
functional and smooth topology, as well as related
              problems
concerning quadratic curvature functionals.  In addition,
Anderson
              and LeBrun both plan to investigate topics in the
geometry of asymptotically
              hyperbolic manifolds, and relations
with current issues in string theory and
              the AdS/CFT
correspondence.

Anderson's investigations are directly related
              to questions
regarding the physics of black holes and the shape and
              long-term
evolution of the universe. LeBrun's work studies
              fundamental
questions arising from Hawking's quantum gravity program,
              and
relates the Seiberg-Witten equations of high-energy physics to
the study
              of gravitational phenomena.
