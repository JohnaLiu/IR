This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research in
              advanced computational research involves Tony Chan of the University of
              California at Los Angeles, Tim Barth of the Information Sciences Directorate,
              NASA Ames, Herve Guillard of the French National Institute for Research in
              Computer Science and Engineering (INRIA) in Sophia Antipolis and Remi Abgrall
              of the University of Bordeaux. The research collaboration is aimed at the
              development and analysis of discretization methods and solvers based on
              multiscale and multiresolution algorithms; efficient implementation of the new
              discretization and solvers on advanced computing architectures; and
              applications to computational fluid dynamics and structural mechanics. 

This
              award represents the U.S. side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the French
              National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Engineering (INRIA). 
              NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses of the U.S. investigators,
              postdoctoral researchers and graduate students.  INRIA will support the French
              researchers' visits to the United States.  The collaboration is
              interdisciplinary.  The US investigators are expert in the theory and analysis
              of multigrid methods for both elliptic and hyperbolic problems.   This is
              complemented by French expertise in computational fluid dynamics and on
              multiresolutional algorithms for hyperbolic problems.  The project will advance
              understanding of the proposed methods and algorithms and their applications to
              problems in particle physics, fluid dynamics, and cosmology.
