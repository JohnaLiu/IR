Abstract    :
              This is a study of the relationship between fuel injection as a controlling
              parameter and emissions from diesel engines.  Specifically, the study addresses
              the relationships between formation of nitric oxide and high-pressure
              dense-spray combustion dynamics, pulsed injections and spray transients. 
              Experimental tools include a custom-built diesel engine simulator capable of
              producing conditions similar to those in a diesel immediately prior to
              injection, infrared scattering measurements to quantify fuel droplet size and
              liquid volume fraction in the dense-spray region, and line Raman measurements
              to quantify fuel/air ratio and temperature.  Post-combustion gas analysis by
              Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy allows measurement of nitric oxide as
              functions of operating parameters and fuel injected.  Modeling includes
              microscale (single droplet), mesoscale (multiple droplet), and macroscale
              systems.  Models are used to predict emission trends in engines as a function
              of injection parameters.  Continuous interaction between the modeling and
              experimental efforts are necessary to make the physical and numerical systems
              as nearly identical as possible.
