The
              Pacific Northwest Geometry Seminar for 2000 to 2003 provides
opportunities for
              communication between researchers and
dissemination of results and problems in
              areas such as
differential geometry, algebraic geometry, mathematical
              physics,
topology, partial differential equations, complex analysis,
              and
geometric representation theory.  Universities based in the
northwestern
              United States and British Columbia sponsor these
biannual conferences, and
              local participants are augmented by
speakers from outside the
              region.

Modern geometry involves techniques and ideas drawn from all
              of
mathematics and much of physics.  Notions distinctive to the
field include
              curvature, which deduces from measurements of
length and angle the extent to
              which a geometric space differs
from the simplest, flattest models; symplectic
              structures, which
are the geometric underpinnings for the Hamiltonian
              formulation
of mechanics, and our understanding of their geometry has
              been
opened up dramatically by ideas borrowed from physics and
              complex
analysis; and symmetry, since spaces with large groups of
symmetries
              often give our best access to algebraic aspects of
those symmetry groups, and
              since geometry and analysis at the
space level can yield linear
              representations of a group or
explain properties of these representations.
