Abstract:  I propose to concentrate
              on constructive (and, if possible,
efficient) methods for finding and
              characterizing OPTIMAL
geometric representations for combinatorial,
              topological, or 
geometric objects in low dimensions. In one dimension we will
              study graphs, in
two dimensions, Riemann surfaces, in three dimensions --
              compact manifolds. We
will study direct geometric invariants (volume,
              curvature integrals, diameter)
as well as less tractable but in many ways
              attractive spectral invariants
(individual eigenvalues or determinants
              (regularized or not) of elliptic
operators). 

In all cases, our goal is
              find the nicest geometric representation of a
topological object. An obvious
              example is that of the "round" metric on the
sphere. People have been lucky to
              discover this metric early, because the
natural processes of weather work
              stones into approximately round
shapes. Unfortunately, nature is not there to
              help us with more complicated
mathematical objects, so we have to invent
              artificial processes which will
work them into "canonical" shapes, so we can
              better understand the underlying
structure.
