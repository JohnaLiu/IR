Abstract    :
              THE GEOMETRY FESTIVAL
DMS-0072580

The annual Geometry Festival has been held
              since 1985 at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Maryland, the
              University of North Carolina, the State University of New York at Stony Brook,
              Duke University and New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical
              Sciences.  This three day conference focuses on the major recent results in
              geometry and related fields.  There are typically seven invited one-hour talks,
              no parallel sessions, and ample opportunity 
and space for groups to get
              together for discussion.  The award provides partial support for graduate
              students, post-doctoral
researchers, invited speakers and persons from
              under-represented groups to attend the conference.  Facilities at the Geometry
              Festival are
handicapped-accessible.  In several recent Geometry Festivals,
              there have been special activities for women mathematicians. 

The Geometry
              Festival was held April 2-5, 1998 at the State University of New York at Stony
              Brook, April 16-18, 1999 at the University of Pennsylvania, and will be held
              April 14-16, 2000 at the University of Maryland.  Future sites are decided
              approximately one year in advance. 
Further information is available at the
              Geometry Festival websites for last year's conference,
              <http://www.math.upenn.edu/geometryfestival.html>, and at the
site for the
              upcoming conference, <http://www.math.umd.edu/research/geomfest> . 
Each
              Geometry Festival website contains a link to the website for the next Festival,
              as soon as this is known.
