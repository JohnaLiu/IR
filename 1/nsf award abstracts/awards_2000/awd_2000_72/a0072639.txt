Abstract

Okun proposes to
              calculate l_2-homology of right-angled Coxeter groups. In
a recent joint work
              (still in preparation) with M. Davis (the Ohio State
University) we calculated
              l_2-homology of some right-angled Coxeter groups
and, in particular, proved
              Singer's vanishing conjecture for right-angled
Coxeter group manifolds of
              dimension <5. As a corollary we get that Hopf's
conjecture about the sign of
              Euler characteristic of aspherical manifolds
is true for non-positively curved
              (in the sense of
Aleksandrov) 4-dimensional cubical manifolds. Our
              calculations in higher
dimensions are consistent with Singer's  vanishing
              conjecture. Several
conjectures, related to Singer's vanishing conjecture are
              discussed.

Coxeter groups, also known as reflection groups, play an
              important role in
various branches of mathematics. The simplest examples of
              such groups come
from Escher type tilings - tilings of the hyperbolic plane by
              convex
polygons. The higher dimensional analogs of these give a large class
              of
examples in topology and geometry of manifolds. The proposed
              research
concentrates on several longstanding conjectures, as applied to
              these
examples. A surprising corollary of this research is an explicit
              estimate
for the genus of a graph - the minimal genus of the surface in which
              the
graph can be embedded.
