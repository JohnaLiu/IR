              Abstract

This project will examine the origin and dynamics of turbulence in
              the interplanetary medium.  Turbulence will be incorporated into mean-field
              models of the solar wind and the role of turbulence on shock waves and the
              acceleration of particles at shocks will be investigated.  The role of
              turbulence in the modulation of cosmic rays will also be investigated.  The
              coupling of turbulence to the mean-field models of the solar wind will be
              accomplished by introducing source terms for the dissipation of turbulence into
              the large-scale solar wind model.  To investigate the role of turbulence in
              shocks, coupled microscopic and macroscopic models of the shock waves will be
              used to generalize the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions.  The influence of
              turbulence on cosmic ray modulation will be accomplished by adding turbulent
              scattering to existing cosmic ray transport codes.
