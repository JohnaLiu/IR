Although we know that plants can respond to selection by
              pollinators and that for many plants pollinators are critical to successful
              reproduction, it is not clear a) how high spatio-temporal variation in the
              pollinators to a given plant in nature can lead to selection of the diversity
              of floral traits we see today, nor b) how plants will respond to the current
              "pollination crisis." The purpose of the proposed research is to provide
              clarification of how plants may be affected in terms of success and evolution
              by pollinators under a natural situation of pollinator change. This will be
              achieved by testing the assumed and hypothesized consequences of island
              colonization for plants from the mainland, using a novel study site, system and
              combination of research approaches. The pollination biology of plant
              populations will be compared between mainland and island sits, and it will be
              determined how patterns in reproductive success depend on the composition and
              frequency of pollinators and floral and reproductive-assurance traits of study
              populations. This will be done for each of two hummingbird-pollinated plant
              species - a native (Epilobium canum) and a widespread invasive (Nicotiana
              glauca) -  that have colonized the California Channel Islands.
