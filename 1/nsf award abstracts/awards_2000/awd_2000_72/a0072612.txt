     The investigator studies the structure, its robustness
              and
stability, and the transitions of large scale geophysical fluid
flows, to
              arrive at a better understanding of the prediction and
predictability of these
              flows relevant to the typical sources of
low frequency variabilities in
              climate.  The work studies specific
topics in two areas: 1) theoretical issues
              of the primitive
equations, and 2) the presence, sensitivity and robustness
              of
interannual variability characteristics to changes in model
parameters in
              the underlying physical space.  In Area 1, the
investigator studies the
              primitive equations of large scale
ocean/atmosphere flows.  Specific problems
              include stability and
bifurcation issues of the primitive equations and
              related simpler
models, especially in connection to climate low
              frequency
variabilities.  The main objectives in Area 2 are to
              classify
typical large scale atmosphere/ocean circulation flow
              patterns
associated with boundary layer phenomena, and to study
              their
structural bifurcations.  Part of the work in this area is based
on a
              new geometric theory developed recently by the investigator
and T.  Ma.  The
              investigator uses a combination of physical
modelling, asymptotic methods,
              rigorous mathematical theory, and
large scale computing to yield new insights
              into physical
phenomena.  The work involves specific collaborations
              with
atmosphere/ocean scientists.
     The primary goal of this project is to
              document, through
careful theoretical studies, the presence of regular
              interannual
and interdecadal variability in the ocean basins adjacent to
              the
North American continent, to verify the robustness of this
variability's
              characteristics to changes in model parameters, and
to help explain its
              physical mechanisms.  The thorough
understanding of this variability is of the
              essence in
determining the climate system's predictability and prediction
              on
subcontinental and smaller spatial scales, for time scales that
equal and
              exceed a few years.  The associated phenomena include
the double-gyre
              wind-driven ocean circulation and the El
Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
              phenomenon, which dominates
inter-annual climate variability over much of the
              Pacific Ocean,
and hence the world.  The studies could lead to
              improved
predictions of weather, climate, and environmental phenomena.
