CISE Postdoctoral Associates in
              Experimental Computer Science: Manipulation
of Rigid and Deformable Objects
              with Applications in Manufacturing and
Computer-Aided Surgery

Object
              manipulation has been a central theme in robotics over the last
decade. 
              Efficient techniques have been proposed for positioning,
orienting, sorting,
              etc., rigid objects under a variety of constraints and
sensory input. 
              Although several problems concerning rigid parts deserve
further attention,
              recent advances in manufacturing also require the
manipulation of deformable
              objects such as cables, pipes, paper, etc.,
needed for producing compact
              assemblies.  Building on the theory of
manipulation of rigid objects, the
              postdoctoral associate will investigate
the manipulation of deformable objects
              and selected problems involving
rigid object manipulation.  The goal is for
              the associate to assist in (a)
developing appropriate computational models for
              deformable objects, (b)
studying fundamental notions such as stable grasping
              and fixturing of
deformable objects, and (c) providing efficient procedures to
              compute the
expected deformations of objects under manipulation constraints. 
              One
important and challenging application of the proposed work is
              the
simulation of deformable human tissues.  Such a simulation can lead to
              the
development of virtual training environments for surgical
              procedures.
