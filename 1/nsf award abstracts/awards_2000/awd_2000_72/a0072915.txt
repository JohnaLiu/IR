	This experimental program, involving undergraduate
              student
participation as an integral component, investigates
              nuclear
structure through the measurement of ground and excited
              state
magnetic moments.  A major goal of this program is better
understanding
              of the roles of single particle and collective
behavior in determination of
              nuclear magnetism.  Ground state
moments of beta-unstable nuclei are measured
              using the beta-NMR and beta-LMR techniques.  The experiments are conducted
              primarily at NSCL (Michigan State University) and secondarily at GANIL in
              France, with colleagues from MSU and the University of Leuven, Belgium.  
              Excited state moments of deformed nuclei in isotopic chains are measured using
              the Transient Field technique, and the experiments are conducted at Lawrence
              Berkeley National Laboratory with colleagues from Rutgers
              University.
	Participation of undergraduate students is a key element in
              this
experimental program.
