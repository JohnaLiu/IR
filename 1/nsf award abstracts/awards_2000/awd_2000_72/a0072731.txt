Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the preparation and study of the properties of an
              array of highly strained fluorocarbons and fluorocarbons incorporating
              interesting conjugated systems.  The project includes synthesis of a building
              block for use in the construction of perfluoroannulenes and valence isomers, as
              well as synthesis of a new photochemical source of difluorcarbene.

With this
              renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting
              the research of Dr. David M. Lemal of the Department of Chemistry at Dartmouth
              College.  Professor Lemal will focus his work on extending current knowledge of
              fluorocarbon structure, reactivity, and synthesis, and on gaining a deeper
              understanding of those features that distinguish fluorocarbons from hydrocarbon
              analogs.  Fluorocarbons and derived materials have found a tremendous range of
              applications in our society ranging from high-temperature, chemically inert
              polymers to surfactants to refrigerants to blood substitutes to inhalation
              anaesthetics.  The project will provide training in  synthetic and physical
              organic methods for a number of undergraduates and graduate students.
