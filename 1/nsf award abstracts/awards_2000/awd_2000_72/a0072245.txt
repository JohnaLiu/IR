Funding provided for the research under the title
              "Medium-Energy Physics and Fundamental Interactions" will support one graduate
              student for seven months for a study of the nuclear polarization of hydrogen
              molecules resulting from recombination of polarized atoms. Data so far obtained
              show that in a strong magnetic guide field, about 40% of the polarization is
              retained.
