              Theorems and algorithms for Cooperative 
and Dynamic Games:

T.E.S. Raghavan,
              University of Illinois at Chicago


One of the main problems of the proposal
              in 
cooperative game theory is to find efficient 
algorithms to solve for the
              nucleolus of 
combinatorial TU games, based on the successful 
algorithms for
              assignment and interval games.  
A second problem is to study games with
              stable 
cores. In particular to study core stability for 
combinatorial games
              such as assignment games. 
In coalitional bargaining we will look for subgame
              
perfect stationary Nash equilibria of perfect 
information games which
              approximate in its payoff 
the nucleolus payoff.  In the area of dynamic
              games, 
we would like to extend the policy improvement 
algorithm for 
              undiscounted stochastic games 
of perfect information. We would formulate
              models 
of tax evasion as dynamic games and study their 
equilibria.

The 
              problems in cooperative games posed above 
are physically motivated by the
              following questions. 
Federal and state governments undertake costly
              construction 
facilities like bridges, freeways,  water and sewer pipes, 
              
railroads and airports.  Often   the critical  decision 
facing the
              government is to distribute the total cost 
among the users in an equitable
              way.  The algorithms to 
be developed will help to arrive at such equitable
              costs 
after properly modeling the problems as cooperative games.  
Tax
              offices are flooded with tax returns;  Indutrial 
corporations are flooded
              with  vouchers for payment 
approval; automobile manufacturers are supplied
              with large 
consignment of automobile parts for quick acceptance. 
Auditors
              are few in number to audit all tax returns; 
accountants are few to check all
              vouchers; laborataries 
and manpower are limited to test for all defective
              items.  
One can classify the tax returns or vouchers or suppliers 
into
              various categories and make decisions on which items 
in the tax return or
              voucher to audit; what percent of 
defective items in a sample require
              acceptance or more 
testing. Depending on the outcome of auditing, or
              sequential 
sampling one can  make new decisions on  how frequently 
one
              should audit the future returns and vouchers from 
the specific class of
              violators.  In polluting the 
environment, the violators are often big
              manufacturers. 
If the pollutants are distinct, then polluters are some 
what
              identifiable and the cost of cleaning can be 
decentralized. If the pollutants
              are of a few type, then 
one knows roughly which  groups of polluters could
              have 
contributed to which type. The levels of violation would 
require
              sporadic or systematic inspection.  In a way 
the total cost has to be
              collected by suitable taxing 
policies that could vary depending on the levels
              of 
pollution. For an ordinary home owner sewer charges are 
simply tied to
              the water usage.  When the polluters are 
confounded one has to identify
              polluters by sending  
inspectors now and then to make spot check for
              
environmental violations and punish violators by 
various penalties.  In
              such problems the algorithms 
to be developed will show the formal ways of
              arriving at 
cost figures or inspection strategies that are both 
intuitively
              and scientifically defendable.
