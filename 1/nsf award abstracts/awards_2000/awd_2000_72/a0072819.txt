Abstract    :
              Dr. John Arnold, Chemistry Department, University of California - Berkeley, is
              supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              of the Chemistry Division for the development of new monoanionic ligands to
              support catalytic and stoichiometric reactions. The major thrust is to prepare
              a new series of monoanion ligands that will be capable of supporting chemistry
              related to that presently dominated by Cp based systems. Specifically new
              functionalized amidines and derivatized 1,4,7-triazacyclononanes will be
              developed, their complexes with trivalent metals prepared, and their
              stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity investigated.

Reactions mediated by
              transition metal and lanthanide element compounds are important on an
              industrial scale and provide ever increasing fundamental knowledge regarding
              the nature of the chemical bond. In recent years, there has been considerable
              effort in developing ligands (groups that are attached to a metal) that will
              tailor the chemical reactivity and properties of the metal. In this study new
              ligands will be designed to facilitate reactions at metal ions with a 3+
              charge. This is an important goal since many important processes that are known
              to take place at 4+ ions have not yet been efficiently developed for 3+
              counterparts.
