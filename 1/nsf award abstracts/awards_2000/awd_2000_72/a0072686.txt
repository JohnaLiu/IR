Abstract    :
              ATLAS (A Toroidal Large Angle Spectrometer) is a general-purpose detector that
              is designed to exploit the potential of the LHC proton-proton collider.  It is
              an international collaboration of 1500 scientists, from
145 institutes in 31
              countries, including 250 physicists from 28 US institutions. Hampton University
              is participating  in the construction of this detector with responsibilities
              for assembling the "Transition Radiation Tracker".  The LHC will provide 10
              times higher center-of-mass energy and 10-100 times higher proton-proton
              collision rates than previous colliders, thus opening up a new frontier of
              physics.  Discovery of the mass-generating mechanism (via "spontaneous symmetry
              breaking" involving the Higgs boson) is a primary objective of ATLAS.  In
              addition, theoretical developments indicate the possible existence of a more
              general framework (called "supersymmetry") for the building blocks of matter
              and the fundamental interactions, which predicts the existence of a new class
              of fundamental particles.  The discovery of such "supersymmetric particles" is
              another goal.
