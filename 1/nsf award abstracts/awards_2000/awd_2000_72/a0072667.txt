Allen I. Knutson

Allen Knutson's proposed work is about Schubert
              calculus 
on flag manifolds, which combinatorially is about counting 
the
              (obviously nonnegative) number of flags satisfying a 
list of intersection
              conditions with other flags, and is 
computable as a (not obviously
              nonnegative) integral over 
a flag manifold.  The main question in the field
              concerns 
finding a totally-positive combinatorial formula rather than 
the
              alternating sum.  His work with Dr. Terence Tao on the 
case of single
              subspaces, refining totally-positive formulae 
already known and solving
              long-standing conjectures in that 
relatively simple case, has suggested new
              lines of attack 
on the general problem.

Given four straight lines (picture
              them as blue) drawn in 
space, in generic directions, how many other straight
              lines 
(picture them as red) touch all four?  In special cases 
there are
              many, but generically there are exactly two
such red lines. This is the first
              interesting case of a 
general problem counting the number of flat subspaces
              
(in this case one-dimensional) intersecting a number of 
other subspaces
              (which can even be curved).  Computers 
can determine this obviously
              nonnegative number in any 
given case, but do so by adding many large positive
              and 
negative numbers together -- in particular it is difficult 
to determine
              easily if the number is zero.  Also many 
interesting cases in engineering are
              beyond the reach 
of computers.  Dr. Knutson's work concerns the search for
              
a manifestly positive formula for these (no cancelation), 
which in
              particular would make it much more straightforward
to determine which such
              problems have any solutions at all. 
Under previous NSF support he and Dr.
              Terence Tao already
determined this positivity criterion in a famous subcase
              
of the general problem.
