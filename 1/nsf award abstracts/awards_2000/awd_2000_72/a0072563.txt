This one-year award for U.S.-Germany cooperative research in
              biochemistry involves Promod Pratap of the University of North Carolina in
              Greensboro and Uli Nienhaus of the University of Ulm in Germany.  Dr. Pratap
              will spend seven months at the University of Ulm, conducting experiments on
              substrate binding to sodium/potassium ATPase (Na+/K+-ATPase), an enzymatic
              equivalent of a sodium pump.  The pump couples energy released from ATPase
              hydrolysis with transport of sodium and potassium into the cell.  It is
              regulated in vivo by insulin and thyroid hormone and serves as a receptor for
              digital glycoside drugs. The objective of the project is to understand the
              energy requirements for transport mediated by this sodium pump.  The
              investigators will examine the interaction between the enzyme and ATP and probe
              changes in protein structure associated with ATP substrate binding.   Two
              techniques will be employed;  fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
              and single-molecule fluorescence energy transfer (FRET).  

The U.S.
              investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in the proposed enzymatic
              system (sodium/potassium ATPase).  This is complemented by similar German
              expertise.  The project also takes advantage of specialized equipment
              (time-resolved visible infrared spectroscopy) available at the University of
              Ulm.  Detailed molecular understanding of sodium/potassium ATPase will provide
              information about regulating cellular metabolism and energy balance.
