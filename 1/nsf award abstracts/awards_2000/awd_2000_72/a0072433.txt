Abstract    :
              This project is focused on the production of the Moss Flora of Central America,
              which will comprise taxonomic and revisionary treatments of 19 families, 70
              genera, and 210 species native to the entire Central American region. 
              Publication in hardcopy and electronic versions will be in Spanish and English,
              and available on-line, with high-resolution line illustrations.  The moss flora
              of Central America will involve then aming of large numbers of unnamed
              collections that have accumulated over the last twenty-five years.  Duplicate
              material from these collections will be treturned to their country of origin
              where as a primary reference collection it will greatly enhance the ability of
              Latin American bryologists to name their specimens and collections.  The naming
              of Central American mosses in a revisionary context will allow msses to be
              meaningfully incorporated into other interdisciplinary studies, most notably
              ecological studies.
