Abstract:  Quantum cohomology can be thought of as an
              algebraic invariant structure of geometric objects called symplectic manifolds.
               A birational transformation can be thought of as a transformation of a
              symplectic manifold that is an isomorphism outside of a tiny region where
              discontinuity can happen.  The motivation of this project is the following
              question: What is the canonical transformation of quantum cohomology?  Namely,
              what kind of transformation of symplectic manifolds will preserve quantum
              cohomology?  The principal investigator's early results indicate that
              birational transformations may play the role of canonical transformation.  This
              project is devoted to the systematic study of this phenomenon.
