This award provides partial support for
              graduate students, 
postdoctoral researchers, junior faculty, and persons from
              under-represented groups to attend the semi-annual Texas 
Geometry and
              Topology Conference.  The conference is designed 
to enhance the research and
              educational atmosphere of the 
community of geometers and topologists in Texas
              and the 
surrounding states.  The conference has three specific goals. 
              
First the conference is committed to bring researchers of national 
and
              international stature to the area to discuss their research 
and to interact
              with mathematicians from this geographic region.  Second the conference makes
              it possible for the community of 
geometers and topologists from Texas and
              surrounding states (a 
huge geographic region) to meet and share mathematics
              on a regular
basis, which both stimulates individual research and generates
              productive cooperative efforts between schools.  Third the 
conference is
              committed to the strengthening and enrichment of the mathematics personnel
              base. There will be six conferences over three years, hosted by major
              universities in Texas: 
2000-2001: Rice University (fall), Texas Christian
              University (spring)
2001-2002: University of Texas (fall), Texas Tech
              University (spring)
2002-2003: Texas A&M University (fall), University of
              Houston (spring)
In addition, two universities (University of Texas at
              Arlington, University of Texas at Dallas) will assist in the conference at
              Texas Christian University.

The Texas Geometry and Topology Conference has
              been held spring and fall since its founding in 1989, a total of 23 times to
              date.  The roster of mathematicians who have participated in the conference
              includes many of the most influential geometers and topologists in the world. 
              Each conference specifically tailors its program to reflect recent developments
              in important areas of geometry and topology. Information about upcoming
              conferences as well as the mission and history of the conference is always
              available at http://www.math.tamu.edu/research/workshops/TGTC/index.html.
