The Natural History of Museum of Los Angeles County will
              mount and administer a five (5) year tour of an exhibition, "Dogs:  Our Canine
              Companions," which explores the evolution, behavior, diversity and cultural
              significance of dogs.  Visitors to the 6,000 sq. ft. exhibit will gain a better
              knowledge of these familiar animals through a variety of componenets including
              hands-on displays, videos, graphic panels, computer-generated images, dioramas,
              fossil skeletons and educational curriculum materials.

The exhibit will be
              divided into eight (8) sections.  Throughout the sections there are recurring
              themes to unify the educational messages of the adaptive diversity of canids,
              the relationship between wild and domestic dogs, and the relationship between
              dogs and humans -- especially service dogs.

The dissemination of DOGS will
              include presentations to groups and conferences, with particular emphasis on
              the exhibit's treatment of accessibility issues.  There will be an extensive
              web site with animation, movies, sound and interactive elements to further
              enhance the effectiveness of the exhibit and the availability of educational
              materials.

the final ancillary materials to accompany the traveling
              exhibition will be a theater production, a free-standing, self-contained
              learning center, an exhibit guide, and a CD-Rom. Formal education providers
              will benefit from workshops, curriculum guides, and teaching kits.
