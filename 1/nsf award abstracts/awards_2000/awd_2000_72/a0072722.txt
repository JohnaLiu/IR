Abstract:

This project is centered around the
              classification theory of topological 
4-dimensional manifolds. One goal is to
              find sufficient algebraic 
conditions for splitting of a 4-manifold as a
              connected sum, up to an
s-cobordism, in terms of the fundamental group and the
              intersection 
pairing. The main techniques for classification of manifolds,
              
surgery and s-cobordism conjectures, remain open for 4-manifolds 
with large
              fundamental groups. This project will focus on a new 
approach to the problem,
              searching for involutions on certain
canonical examples, and for possible
              obstructions from gauge theory.

The classification of possible large-scale
              structures in dimension 4,
which locally look like the 4-dimensional
              space-time, turned out to be
a much more subtle problem than in higher
              dimensions. This area of
research lies at the intersection of topology,
              geometry, analysis and 
physics. This project is aimed at a better
              understanding of 4-dimensional 
objects with large fundamental groups, which
              contain many loops 
that cannot be contracted. In particular, one goal is to
              analyze when 
a given object may be decomposed into more elementary building
              blocks.
