Abstract    :
              Professor Veronica Vaida of the University of Colorado and a senior research
              associate, Dr. Roberto Bianco, are funded by the Experimental Physical
              Chemistry and Atmospheric Chemistry programs to perform experimental and
              theoretical studies on atmospheric aerosols containing organic compounds. 
              Organic aerosols are known to be important in problems related to the
              interaction of solar radiation and Earth's climate and to the human respiratory
              system.  Structures, properties and dynamics of the particles are not well
              understood.  This proposal seeks to combine new experimental methods including
              micelles electrosprayed into the gas phase with a wide array of theoretical
              methods to characterize aqueous particles of varying pH coated with
              amphiphiles.  Three aspects are to be studied:  the detailed molecular
              morphology of the aerosols by light scattering, followed by spectroscopic
              studies of  non-reactive interactions of gas phase molecules with the aerosols,
              and finally, reactions on aerosol surfaces.  Theoretical work by Dr. Bianco
              using molecular dynamics, stochastic kinetic modeling and quantum mechanics
              will parallel the experimental studies.   

Using the acquired data and
              physical models, the PIs will interact with atmospheric chemists at NOAA in
              Boulder to evaluate the effect of organic atmospheric aerosols on the
              absorption of solar radiation in the atmosphere. This information is required
              for accurate modeling and prediction of global climate changes.
Professor
              Vaida's educational efforts include outreach to Hispanic students in the Denver
              area.
