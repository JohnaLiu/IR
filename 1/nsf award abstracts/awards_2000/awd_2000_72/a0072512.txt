Dusa McDuff

McDuff will continue studying the structure of
              symplectic 
manifolds and of the group G(M) of diffeomorphisms that 
preserve
              the symplectic structure on a given manifold M. 
Working together with
              Francois Lalonde, she recently 
discovered that these diffeomorphisms do not
              twist the 
manifold topologically very much. Indeed, using ideas 
from
              quantum homology, they have shown that the homotopy 
groups of the Hamiltonian
              subgroup H of G(M) act trivially 
on the rational homology of the underlying
              manifold M.  The
conjecture is that any fiber bundle with structural group
H 
              is a product as far as its rational cohomology is concerned.  
She also plans
              to study other topological implications of the
existence of quantum homology,
              in particular its consequences 
for the Flux conjecture. 

A  symplectic
              structure is a very basic structure on space 
that underlies the equations of
              classical physics.   They 
have become very prominent recently because of
              their 
appearance in modern theories of duality, especially in 
the "mirror
              symmetry" phenomena of high energy physics.  Mathematically, they are very
              interesting and help in 
understanding 4 dimensional spaces (curved
              space-times).   
Recently McDuff has focussed her attention on studying 
the
              different ways that the points of a space can
move while still preserving this
              structure.  Working with 
a collaborator, she has found that some ideas coming
              from 
string theory (known in the field as "quantum homology") 
show that
              spaces with symplectic structures are much more 
rigid than ones without, and
              cannot be moved and twisted up
very much.  She intends to pursue this line of
              questioning 
during the period of the grant.  Many very interesting
              
symplectic rigidity phenomena have been discovered, but 
there are still
              plenty of open questions.
