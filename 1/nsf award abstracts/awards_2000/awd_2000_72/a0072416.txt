This award supports research in connection with experiments
              at
Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF).  The primary effort
              is directed at the RadPhi experiment, which measures
radiative decays of the
              phi(1020) meson to scalar states a0(980) and
f0(980).  The relative rates of
              these decay modes hold an important
clue that is need to resolve a
              long-standing puzzle surrounding the
quark-gluon structure of these states.  A
              second line of research is
directed toward the proposed Hall D facility at
              TJNAF, which has the
potential to provide qualitative new insights into the
              nature of
confinement in mesons.  UConn will play a major role by
              taking
freponsibility for the design of a new coherent photon source
              and
beamline.
