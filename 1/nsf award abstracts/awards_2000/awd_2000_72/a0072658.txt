In Symplectic Topology, the properties in question are
              usually
formalized in the language of Floer homology theory and
              Gromov-
Witten invariants. The proposed project is to extend and
intertwine
              these two formalisms in the context of Contact Topology.
The generalization
              exhibits natural relationships with the string
theory and, moreover, shows how
              the structures of classical and
quantum field theory emerge form the stringy
              properties of
contact Floer homology. The project is conceived as a joint
              work
of the P.I. with Ya. Eliashberg (Stanford University) and
H. Hofer
              (Courant Institute) and is a part of the larger project
"Symplectic Field
              Theory" started by the latter two authors
several years ago.

The project
              originates from Symplectic and Contact Topology
launched in the beginning of
              the twentieth century by A. Hurwitz
and H. Poincare and studying profound
              geometrical properties of
classical mechanical systems.  The mechanical
              notions of position
and momentum coordinates lead to the geometric notion of
              a
symplectic structure, in which the Hamiltonian formulation of
mechanics
              becomes extremely natural.  Contact structures are the
odd-dimensional
              counterparts to symplectic structures.  In
addition to their appearances in
              the study of subspaces of
symplectic manifolds, contact structures have been
              of particular
interest in dimension three, where geometric ideas
              are
illuminating some difficult questions in topology
