Abstract    :
              Photorealistic image synthesis is one of the most fundamental problems in
              computer graphics, with
a wide variety of applications. In recent years,
              tremendous progress has been made in the
simulation of light transport and the
              resulting lighting effects. Unfortunately, the underlying
material models are,
              by comparison, primitive and assume that the materials are both pristine
              and
immutable, even though real materials are neither. This severely limits
              the range of appearances
that can be produced. This research program will
              focus on the development of computer graphics
models for materials, which will
              be suitable for the requirements of image synthesis.

During the award
              period, the research will address two key aspects of this problem: (1)
              Taxonomy
of materials:  a study of a wide variety of materials will be
              conducted in order to devise a
classification of materials that is appropriate
              for computer graphics. (2) A measurement device:  a
portable device for
              measuring surface appearance properties in the field will be
              designed,
simulated, and eventually constructed.

The research program will
              be integrated with a training plan that will afford the postdoctoral
associate
              a variety of opportunities for professional development.
