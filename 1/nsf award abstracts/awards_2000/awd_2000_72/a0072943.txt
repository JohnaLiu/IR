DDIG: Redundancy of belowground ecosystem function
              among native C4 perennial bunchgrass species of Pinus palustris
              savannas


Plant species have been shown to dramatically affect belowground
              ecosystem functions such as nutrient pool sizes, nutrient cycling and water
              availability. Most of these studies have used exotic (non-native) species. The
              degree to which native species drive belowground ecological processes and the
              amount of redundancy within a given ecosystem is less well understood. In this
              project, the investigators will assess key parameters of the nitrogen cycle and
              water availability as well as plant traits above and below ground as they
              relate to belowground ecosystem functions. Specifically, the PIs will use field
              and glasshouse studies to examine the redundancy in belowground functioning of
              several bunchgrasses native to fire-driven southeastern savannas. The research
              is expected to provide valuable information for ongoing conservation and
              restoration of this and similar ecosystem types.
