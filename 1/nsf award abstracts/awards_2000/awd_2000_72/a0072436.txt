Abstract    :
              This US-Brazil award supports Dr. Marleigh Sheaff, University of
              Wisconsin-Madison, and Dr. John P. Cumalat, University of Colorado, to work
              with Professors Joao Anjos, Ignacio Bediaga, Jussara Miranda, and Alberto Reis
              of Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Fisicas (CBPF) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in
              the field of elementary particle physics.  They will work together on analysis
              projects, such as the FOCUS experiment (Fotoproduction of Charm in an Upgraded
              Spectrometer), that concern decays of charm mesons and baryons and the
              production of charm particles by photons on nuclear targets.

This
              collaborative project will allow U.S. students to travel to Brazil to join an
              on-going collaboration, FOCUS, which is a fixed target charm-quark experiment
              based at Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois.  Our counterpart agency in Brazil,
              CNPq, will provide support for a Brazilian student to be based at Fermilab. 
              Through this award researchers from both the U.S. and Brazil collaborate on
              large-science projects of mutual interest, and younger physicists from both
              countries have the experience of working in an international setting early in
              their careers.
