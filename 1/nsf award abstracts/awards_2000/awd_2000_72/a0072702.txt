Abstract    :
              This project will continue inventory of selected arthropod (insects and
              arachnid) taxa along an elecational transect at the La Selva Biological
              Station, Costa Rica.  This work builds on the achievements of Project ALAS, an
              ongoing inventory of tropical rainforest arthropods at La Selva, a biotically
              rich and scientifically active research station situated in the Atlantic
              lowlands of Costa Rica.  ALAS is a collaborative project of the Organization
              for Tropical Studies and the Insituto Nacional de Biodiversidad (INBio, Costa
              Rica).  In this work, the biogeographic scope of ALAS is expanded to include
              the adjacent forested slopes of Volcan Barva, which extend from 30 m elevation
              rainforest at La Selva to 2900m montane forest at the summit (the Barva
              Transect).  Because species turnover is dramatic along trpical elevational
              gradients, this project promises to yield specimens of many new taxa, while
              increasing scientific understanding of earlier inventory results from La Selva
              and revealing much about the bioclimatic distribution of tropical arthropod
              biodiversity.  The proposal calls for intensive sampling at three sites and
              less intensive sampling at an additional seven sites.  The ten sites will be
              distributed at 250 m elevation intervals from La Selva to the summit of the
              Barva Transect.  At all ten sites, a Malaise trap will be maintained for the
              full three years of the proejct, and a pair of Winkler samplers will be taken. 
              Intensive sampling will take place at 500m, 1000m, and 2000m elevations, with a
              pulse sample representing all taxons at the 1000m site.  The primary goals of
              Project ALAS are arthropod inventory, species discovery, and scientific support
              of the advancement of systematics.
