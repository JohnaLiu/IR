Thorpe

This award for dissertation enhancement in intelligent and
              information systems involves Charles Thorpe and his graduate student, Terrence
              Fong, of Carnegie Mellon University and the research group of Charles Bauer of
              the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Ecole Polytechnique Federale) in
              Lausanne, Switzerland. The project, which addresses research and applications
              in vehicle operation (remote driving) in general, focuses on advanced
              teleoperation operator interfaces.  In collaboration with the Swiss group,
              Terence Fong's dissertation research will (1) investigate peer-to-peer
              human-computer interaction and adjustable autonomy; (2) create web-based user
              interfaces to enable teleoperation by novices without instruction or training;
              and (3) develop techniques for creating sensor fusion displays suitable for
              vehicle teleoperation. 

This award will support the incremental costs of the
              international collaboration; that is, Fong's travel to Lausanne, Switzerland
              and his living expenses.  The project takes advantage of Swiss expertise in
              interfaces, which take an active role in human-computer interaction, flexible
              adaptation, unique facilities at the Lausanne campus. The project will advance
              fundamental understanding of collaborative human-robot control and remotely
              operated vehicles and systems.
