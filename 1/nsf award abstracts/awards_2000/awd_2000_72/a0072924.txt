This dissertation research is a multiscale analysis of
              vascular epiphyte communities in tropical wet forests of northeastern Costa
              Rica. This study will examine distribution and abundance of vascular epiphytes
              in relation to their environment at three scales: (1) within individual tree
              crowns, focusing on the effects of variation in canopy microclimate, (2) among
              tree species, focusing on the effects of microclimate and tree species
              characteristics, and (3) among an elevation gradient, focusing on the effects
              of tree species characteristics and macroclimatic variation. The study will
              occur in lowland tropical rainforest at La Selva Biological Station and along
              the adjacent forested elevation gradient in Braulio Carrillo National Park. At
              La Selva, this work will examine the effects of microenvironmental factors and
              host tree characteristics on total vascular epiphyte diversity, species
              composition, and abundance within and among three common canopy tree species.
              Along the elevation gradient from 30 to 3000 meters, this study will examine
              macroenvironmental factors that may be linked to species composition in two
              major epiphyte groups: Bromleiaceae and Pteridophytes. This research will
              contribute substantially to our knowledge of vascular epiphyte communities,
              epiphyte diversity in relation to host trees, and ecological distributions of
              epiphytes with respect to canopy microenvironment and tree characteristics.
