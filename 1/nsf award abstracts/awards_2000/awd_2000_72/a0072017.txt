This RUI grant is a continuation of support of the research
              of this mid-career PI at a predominantly undergraduate institution.  This grant
              contains a collaboration with G. A. Melkov, Ukraine, and has been co-funded by
              the INT division.  The PI has an illustrious record in the study of nonlinear
              spin-wave phenomena in thin magnetic films.  In general his interests lie in
              the study of nonlinear wave dynamics in dispersive, diffractive and weakly
              dissipative media.  This renewal grant focuses on 1-d and 2-d nonlinear spin
              waves, including (1) generation of bright spin wave envelope solitons by a
              linear source, (2) non-adiabatic interaction of a propagating wave packet with
              strongly localized parametric pumping and (3) Use of non stationary parametric
              pumping to amplify or turn around envelope solitons or 2-d spin wave bullets
              using 3-wave interaction.  In addition there will be further study of
              collisions between solitons and bullets and of size dependent quantization of
              spin wave spectrum in an array of micron size magnetic dots.

This RUI
              grant for research in an undergraduate institution also contains support for a
              strong international collaboration.  It has been co-funded by the INT division.
              The grant supports a continuation of the PI's research program on non-linear
              spin waves.  These are large amplitude magnetization waves in a magnet, which
              occasionally have extraordinary properties and the waves then (similar to a
              wall of magnetization) are called solitons.  In another circumstances, the
              waves also resemble bullets.  The research here concerns the properties of
              solitons and bullets, how they can be created, how there motion can be affected
              by small and slow changes in the environment, how they bump into each other and
              what happens afterwards.  The work will be carried out in collaboration with
              colleagues in Ukraine and Russia.
