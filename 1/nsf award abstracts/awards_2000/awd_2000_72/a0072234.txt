Using wavelet packets and other signal-adapted waveforms, 
we
              build cheap and efficient `best basis' representations 
for complicated
              digital signals and images.  Used on very 
large datasets, these reduce the
              complexity of processing, 
transmitting, and storing data.  Some near-term
              applications 
suggested by our prior work are:

- fast approximate singular
              value decomposition, and fast
approximate discrete Hilbert transforms;

-
              signal segmentation through local spectrum change 
detection;

- fast
              discrete atomic decomposition for feature detection 
and adapted data
              compression.

The long-term goals of this research program are:

-
              understanding, controlling, and constructing 
signal-adapted waveforms;

-
              high-performance computing with adapted waveforms.

We can achieve these
              goals through a deeper understanding 
of some discoveries from our prior
              supported research.  
We must know, using certain signal-adapted
              representations,

- can we measure information content more accurately, and
              
thus reduce the storage size of a signal or image?

-can we lower the
              fundamental limit of automatic 
detection of signal features?

- what
              algorithm modifications are needed to obtain 
adapted waveforms with
              additional desirable properties?

Our work is used to automate or improve
              tasks such as: 
segmentation of continuous speech into syllables for speech
              
recognition; analysis and compression of seismic petroleum 
exploration
              data; fingerprint image compression that 
preserves features needed for
              automatic identification; 
de-noising and preconditioning of radar signals
              before 
automatic feature detection and classification; and 
speedups of
              certain basic matrix computations.  Our methods 
include: devising new
              high-performance algorithms to 
compute certain quantities; running numerical
              experiments 
and simulations to evaluate their range of usefulness; 
and
              proving mathematical guarantees for these algorithms 
such as maximums for
              running times with minimums for 
accuracy.
