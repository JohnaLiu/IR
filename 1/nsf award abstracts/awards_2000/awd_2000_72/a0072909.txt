NCEAS: National Center for Ecological Analysis and
              Synthesis

The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)
              was established to promote interactions between scientists and facilitate the
              use of existing information to address important ecological questions. The
              center supports several types of activities involving Working Groups (20 or
              fewer scientists meeting for several days, multiple times a year), Center
              Fellows (sabbatical visitors), Postdoctoral Associates, and graduate and
              undergraduate students.  The vision for NCEAS has been to catalyze a new
              culture of synthesis. The NCEAS model for collaboration has been particularly
              successful with 1) interdisciplinary syntheses that bring together people who
              have not collaborated before to focus on novel questions and approaches and 2)
              intensive, sustained investigations to make progress in core areas of ecology.
              This award will support NCEAS operations for an additional six years, enabling
              it to serve the ecological community by cultivating a new generation of
              ecologists who merge interdisciplinary interactions, intensive analysis or
              modeling, and the technology and culture of information management with their
              inherent intellectual curiosity and commitment to yield important, scholarly
              research.
