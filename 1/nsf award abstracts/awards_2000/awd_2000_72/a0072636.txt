The nuclear astrophysics and astronomy groups at Notre Dame
              University and Michigan State  University have formed a collaboration for
              developing and promoting a wide scale  experimental and theoretical nuclear
              astrophysics program. The Grant to support the  resulting Joint Institute for
              Nuclear Astrophysics, JINA, will provide funds for a  visitors program. The
              visitors program will be administered by Michigan State University  and will
              allow a number of short term (one to two week) and a few long term (one to two
              month) visits from researchers from the astrophysical model community. The goal
              of the  program will be to identify key nuclear reaction rates that can be
              measured with current  experimental facilities. In particular, rates that
              relate to recent abundance  observations now possible with large aperture and
              spaced based observatories will be  emphasized.
