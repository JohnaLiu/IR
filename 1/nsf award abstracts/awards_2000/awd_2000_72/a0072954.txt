Shatz
This award supports Sol Shatz of the University of
              Illinois-Chicago and several junior researchers chosen from a broad group
              within the United States to attend a European Workshop on Software Engineering
              in Aarhus, Denmark.  The workshop is being organized on the European side by
              Mario Pezze of the Polytechnic University in Milan, Italy.  US researchers will
              join with scientists from all over Europe to discuss the use of Petri nets and
              other formal methods for the construction of software systems.  Petri nets are
              a well-established method for modeling concurrent systems, and they are widely
              taught.  The organizers are taking a broader view, though, and will focus
              attention on the application of their formal models to the building of real
              software systems.  The workshop is being held in conjunction with the 21st
              International Conference on Application and theory of Petri Nets.
