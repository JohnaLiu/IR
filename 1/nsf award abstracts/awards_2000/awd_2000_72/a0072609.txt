Abstract    :
              The aim of this work is to understand significant aspects of wave
phenomena
              through developing and applying the methods of
nonlinear dynamics --- the
              mathematics of systems that change in
time and space. A main goal is to
              explain the robustness or
stability of solitons, an important class of waves
              which exhibit
particle-like properties and are capable of a remarkably
              deep
and explicit mathematical description. The mathematics of wave
dynamics
              is also unexpectedly important for prograss concerning a
fundamental problem
              in materials science. To understand how 
an alloy's microscopic structure
              coarsens in time, the
investigator is developing a new mathematical
              understanding of
wave-like transport for singular mass distributions.

This
              work seeks to explain mathematically a number of poorly
understood
              characteristics of waves of various kinds, surface
waves on fluids being a
              prime example. Such characteristics
include: the extraordinary stability of
              solitons (waves that
persist in isolation); the tsunami-like qualities of
              wakes
produced in certain conditions by modern fast car ferries; and
the
              nature of the powerful forces created when waves focus and
break
              simultaneously. The common thread that runs through these
investigations is
              the effective understanding of physical
phenomena through the development of
              new mathematical methods for
analyzing dynamic change.
