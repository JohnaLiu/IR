This
              project is primarily concerned with Gromov-Witten
invariants.  The
              investigator will study the Gromov-Witten
invariants of a 3-fold X by
              determining the local contributions
of a suitably rigid curve C in X. In
              particular, the investigator
will study the integrality properties of such
              contributions and
their relationship to the number of certain BPS states
              in
M-theory as defined via the formula of Gopakumar and Vafa. For
nodal
              curves C, the investigator will continue his work with Katz
and Leung; for
              smooth higher genus curves C, the investigator
will continue work begun with
              R. Pandharipande. In collaborations
with Leung, the investigator will also
              seek to define a new
invariant of symplectic 4-manifolds which would
              specialize to the
modified Gromov-Witten invariants defined by Behrend and
              Fantechi
for algebraic surfaces with positive geometric genus (which in
turn
              generalized the modified invariants defined by the
investigator and Leung for
              K3 and Abelian surfaces). Such an
invariant would be better suited to study
              the enumerative
geometry of irrational surfaces than the ordinary
              Gromov-Witten
invariants.

In the physics of string theory, particles are
              replaced with
one-dimensional objects (``strings'') and so the path that
              a
particle traces out over time becomes a surface in space-time
              (a
``world-sheet''). The equations of string theory then tell us
that the
              surface should be a holomorphic surface (a Riemann
surface) mapped into
              space-time in a holomorphic manner. This has
led to the purely mathematical
              notion of Gromov-Witten
invariants. Gromov-Witten invariants study holomorphic
              mappings
of Riemann surfaces into higher dimensional geometric objects
(for
              example, projective manifolds). They have become important
invariants in
              geometry, topology, and algebraic geometry as well
as being central in string
              theory. Bryan's project specifically
addresses the problem of how the
              algebraic geometry of a
projective manifold is encoded in the Gromov-Witten
              invariants
and how they are tied to string theory.  Algebraic geometry is
              a
classical subject in pure mathematics that has recently found
application
              in such diverse subjects as robotics and coding
theory; string theory is the
              leading candidate for a "theory of
everything", i.e. a single physical theory
              that describes all
known physical phenomenon.
