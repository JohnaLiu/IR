Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to investigate processes that control
              surface-air exchange of carbon dioxide, heat and water vapor over forest
              vegetation in non-ideal conditions (hilly terrain, patchy canopy, free
              convection, rain and stable stratification) through critical analysis of
              existing data and data from ongoing field experiments. The primary motivation
              for this research is that there is considerable interest among the scientific
              community in long-term, micrometeorological studies to understand the role of
              forest ecosystems in atmospheric carbon, energy and water cycles. Quantitative
              knowledge of atmospheric processes in these non-ideal conditions is needed. The
              ultimate goal of this project is to advance micrometeorological theory beyond
              the traditional focus on ideal conditions.
	Data will be acquired through
              collaborations with various researchers. They will come from the 1994 and 1996
              BOREAS (Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Studies) experiments and from ongoing
              experiments at two other forest sites, an AmeriFlux site on flat terrain near
              Toronto, Canada, and a new site on moderate topography in Connecticut. The data
              include tower-based flux observation, meteorology, soil chamber, soil carbon
              and physical property, and biometric monitoring.
