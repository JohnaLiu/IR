Prof. Bell has shown that the Bergman, Szego, and Poisson
              kernels
associated to a finitely connected region in the plane are
elementary
              combinations of only three, and sometimes even two,
analytic functions of one
              complex variable related to geometric
constructions associated to the domain. 
              Bell will study deeper
questions about complexity in potential theory posed by
              his
recent findings and he will extend these results to finite
Riemann
              surfaces.  Bell has also formulated a unique continuation
property for the
              inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations that he
has shown yields information
              about the behavior of holomorphic
mappings between domains in complex space. 
              He will attempt to
verify the property on important classes of domains such as
              the
strictly pseudoconvex domains.

The mathematical objects of potential
              theory and conformal
mapping are ubiquitous in Science, Mathematics, and
              Engineering.
They carry encoded within them a vast amount of information
              about
geometric properties of regions in the plane.  Although these
objects
              are familiar and well studied, they continue to be a
source of interesting and
              applicable new mathematics.  Professor
Bell will express the classical objects
              of potential theory
associated to a two dimensional region with holes in terms
              of
much simpler analytic objects.  These results will give rise to
new and
              practical methods for understanding the solutions to many
classical problems
              in differential equations, conformal mapping,
and potential theory that should
              be of interest to scientists and
engineers.  Bell will explore applications of
              his ideas to more
complicated constructions in the subject and he and his
              students
will test the efficacy of the numerical methods stemming from
              the
work.  Because humans best perceive higher dimensional objects by
taking
              a series of two dimensional slices, the tools developed by
Bell could find
              many applications.
