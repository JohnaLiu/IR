Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

The first direction of the research will be an investigation of the
              ordinary 
partition relation and the polarized partition with exponents 2  and
              
1,1 respectively.  

The second direction will be the continuation of a
              long and  fruitful collaboration with Peter Komjath.  The investigators will 
              work on the following topics:  Square bracket partition relations for order
              types,  the simultaneous chromatic number and splitting of graphs,  and the
              obligatory finite subsystems of large chromatic set systems. 

The PI will
              collaborate on compact scattered spaces with Istvan Juhasz:

The award will
              also contain Visitor Support, which  the continues a very successfull visitor
              program. Pofessor Saharon Shelah regularly spends the months  September and
              October at the Rutgers Mathematics Department.  Many logicians come to work
              with him  on their  problems.
