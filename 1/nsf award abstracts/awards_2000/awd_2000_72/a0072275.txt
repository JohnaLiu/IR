Abstract    :
              The Gordon Research Conference on Polymers (East) will take place June 10-15,
              2000 at Connecticut College and will be devoted to the range of subjects in
              polymer science that are seen to project developments in the future century. 
              The entire conference can be found on the web at
              [http://www.grc.uri.edu/programs/2000/polyeast.htm].  As a bridge between the
              20th and 21st centuries there will be a program titled "Stories from the 20th
              Century," to offer a context for the lectures on cutting-edge developments in
              polymer science.  Distinguished contributors to polymer science in the 20th
              century have been invited to this program and many of them will also act as
              discussion leaders for the regular program.

The NSF contributions will allow
              graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the conference and present
              their work in the form of posters.  These young people will act as an
              interesting counterpoint to the senior investigators from the Stories section. 
              A committee of speakers and discussion leaders from he program will choose the
              best of these poster presentations and these presenters will be asked to give
              oral presentations before the whole conference.
