Abstract    :
              This proposal builds on a previous NSF sponsored project DMS-9626159, awarded to
              Duke University.  It involves development of statistical concepts, theories and
              methods for multiresolution models and analyses of measurements and structures
              in atmospheric turbulence.  It draws on recent developments in  Bayesian
              multiscale modeling to understand the time-scale aspects of turbulence where
              the notions of scale and hierarchy are intrinsic.  Multiresolution statistical
              modeling approaches are applied to vast geophysical measurements arising  from
              air quality field experiments and simulations in order to identify key
              structural properties of atmospheric turbulence responsible for the transport
              of scalars, such as ozone.  To achieve these objectives a team of researchers
              with expertise in statistical modeling and  multiscale methods (M. Pensky and
              B. Vidakovic) and measurement and modeling of atmospheric turbulence (G. Katul)
              is assembled.

The aplicability of this project is improved fundamental
              understanding of atmospheric transport via novel statistical techniques. 
              Atmospheric transport, key to describing air-quality, is a complex phenomena
              involving modeling of turbulence which is responsible for the dispersion of
              polutants.  The applicability of the proposed methodology will be directly
              tested on high frequency  velocity, temperature, and ozone concentration 
              measurements collected at Duke Forest, Durham, North Carolina.
