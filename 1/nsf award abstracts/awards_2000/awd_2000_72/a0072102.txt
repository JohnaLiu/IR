TITLE: 
              Experimental Partnership: FlexRAM: An Advanced Intelligent Memory
              System

Dramatic increases in the number of transistors that can be
              integrated on a single chip have enabled both microprocessor performance and
              memory chip capacity to rise spectacularly.  However, they have also led to an
              increasingly constraining data transfer bottleneck between processor and memory
              system.  Recognizing the need for new architectural approaches that alleviate
              this bottleneck, researchers have proposed the integration of processor and
              DRAM in a single chip.  This architecture is popularly known as intelligent
              memory (IRAM) or processor-in-memory (PIM).

Unfortunately, simple
              integration of current microprocessors and DRAM on a single chip often delivers
              only modest performance improvements-it moves an off-chip bottleneck on chip. 
              Furthermore, the resulting system is often very hard to program.  Finally,
              Little effort has been invested trying to identify a wide range of applications
              that can exploit this architecture
              effectively.
