Abstract    :
              The authors propose to perform exploratory research into the requirement
              parameters for developing an interactive, personalized, question/answer
              learning environment for K-6 students using digital virtual museums.  New
              technologies in computer and computational science can be synthesized with
              effective museum science techniques to provide a learning environment to combat
              the loss of decline in achievement, and loss of interest in science in
              elementary school students.  A key question to be resolved is the
              identification of the needs to develop such a computer program.  This research
              will then form the basis of a subsequent proposal to further develop this
              concept.
