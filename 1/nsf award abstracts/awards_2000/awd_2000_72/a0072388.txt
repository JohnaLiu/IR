              ABSTRACT

SINGULAR CONTROL OF DIFFUSION PROCESSES
AND ITS APPLICATIONS TO THE
              MODELS OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS

The proposed research lies within the area of
              optimal
stochastic control. It deals with optimal control of
diffusion
              processes by means of singular with respect
to time functionals.  This type of
              control naturally
appears in the problems in which there is no
              natural
restriction on the rates of control and  as a result
the  optimal
              control rate is infinite. The optimal
policy in these types of problems is to
              reflect the
process from an a priori unknown boundary.  Such type
of action
              also arises in problems with additive control,
as an approximation for a
              "bang-bang" optimal policy.
The proposed research consists of developing the
              theory
of the related Partial Differential Equations with
              gradient
constraints, studying optimal reflecting barriers and
optimal
              policies in one dimensional and multidimensional
cases.  Applications include
              stochastic control models
of flexible manufacturing systems as well as
              dividend
optimization and  multidimensional portfolio optimization
models. It
              is also intended to consider application of
the singular stochastic control
              theory to optimization     
problems in  insurance. We will also study
              stochastic
control models of large economies and analysis of the
relationship
              between the general framework of the no
arbitrage asset pricing in
              mathematical finance and the
equilibrium paths in those models.

In addition
              to developing new stochastic control and stochastic
processes theory, the
              applications of this research would
include devising better models for
              optimization of the
manufacturing processes and outputs. In addition our
              research
would also result in developing new optimization models
in
              mathematical finance and insurance.  While perceived by
many nonspecialists as
              a tool for making a fast profit,
mathematical finance in fact is a
              "technology" for risk
reduction. In this regard its merge with insurance is
              only
too natural. The issues of controlling the risk as well as
insurance
              aspects of the financial risk has loomed large
recently in both financial
              markets as well as in the insurance
industry. The importance of optimization
              in devise of the
policies employed by insurance and financial institutions
is
              hard to overestimate. Exposure to unnecessary economic and   
financial risks
              and failure to employ the optimal procedures
may have serious economic and
              social impacts. Our research
deals with development of mathematical models of
              optimal
risk control techniques for financial and insurance
              corporations.
This  will also enable one to get a better insight into
              the
nature of the optimal risk reduction techniques a publicly
traded
              financial corporation should adhere to, as well as the
optimal dividend
              distribution policy it should follow.
