Abstract    :
              Solvers for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the backbone of much of
              scientific computing. In particular, they are the basis of Computational Fluid
              Dynamics (CFD), the modeling of liquid and gas flows. This project studies new,
              efficient methods for solving PDEs and implements those methods on modern
              high-performance parallel computers. These solvers are useful in areas other
              than their original CFD home - in particular, surprising applications to
              diverse areas such as image restoration and VLSI placement will be studied as
              well.

Technically, this project will investigate efficient algebraic
              multiscale algorithms for elliptic and non-elliptic PDE and CFD problems on
              arbitrary unstructured meshes which are suitable for distributed and shared
              memory parallel computing architectures. In addition, it will study how these
              algorithms can be extended to other large scale non-PDE problems, including
              image restoration and VLSI placement problems. Three aspects of these
              multiscale algorithms will be emphasized in this work: (1) Issues arising from
              making these algorithms more algebraic (for ease of use) including robustness
              to anisotropy, jumps and oscillations in coefficients, homogenization, etc. (2)
              Extension of these algorithms from their normal elliptic setting to
              non-elliptic and more generally non-PDE, graph-based settings. (3) Performance
              on modern high performance computer architectures with particular attention
              paid to communication and cache memory latency. Particular attention will be
              placed on algorithms appropriate for solving discretization matrices arising
              from a variety of large scale scientific computing problems such as CFD for
              advection dominated problems, VLSI placement an image processing. The
              non-elliptic behavior of these practical problems renders the known multilevel
              theory inadequate and serves to motivate a balanced effort consisting of
              algorithmic development, theoretical analysis, and practical application.
