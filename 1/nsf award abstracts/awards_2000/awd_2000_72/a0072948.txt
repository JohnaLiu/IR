Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the design and evaluation of hardware assists and
              software profiling techniques that allow better utilization and performance of
              the memory hierarchy of high-performance systems.  The overall goal is to
              lessen the impact of the increasing speed discrepency between processors and
              the various levels of the memory hierarchy.

The research methodology will
              compare the results of offline, optimal algorithms with algorithms that can be
              feasibly implemented in a memory system, to guage the performance increase
              possible from prediction triggering, indexing, prediction mechanisms, and
              feedback.  This methodology will be applied to three specific problems: 
              Dynamic line size choice, replacement algorithms for caches with large
              associativities, and prefetching in lower levels of the memory hierarchy.
