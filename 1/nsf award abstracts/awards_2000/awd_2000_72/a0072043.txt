Embedded computer systems have become key
              building blocks of our nation's vital infrastructures.  
Embedded computers
              are components in a large number of other automated devices and consumer
              appliances. Examples of automated devices include air conditioning systems,
              elevators, fire control systems, security systems, lighting systems, etc. 
              Consumer appliances with embedded computers include VCRs, facsimile machines,
              set-top boxes, modems, cellular telephones, pagers, printers, photocopiers,
              etc.

This project seeks to address the embedded software development problem
              by developing algorithm tools, and techniques to support embedded system
              software development using high-level languages. Initially, our research will
              focus on algorithms and tools targeted at digital signal processors and the
              embedded applications they support.  

This project will build on and extend
              the Zephyr compiler infrastructure being developed at the University of
              Virginia and Princeton University.  The goal of the Zephyr project is to build
              compiler infrastructure that enables and supports cutting-edge computing
              systems research.
