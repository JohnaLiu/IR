The Exploratorium will conduct a controlled, two-year research
              project, titled "Finding Significance," to study how different exhibit
              presentation techniques affect visitors' abilities to make meaning -- or find
              significance -- and how such techniques impact learning.  The techniques will
              be applied to a varied sample of five exhibits commonly found in science and
              children's museums.  The exhibit design techniques include a) sharing scientist
              and exhibit developer stories, b) sharing visitor stories, and c) modeling
              inquiry.  Although each technique shows promise at eliciting personal
              significance, they have yet to be rigorously tested and applied to the same set
              of exhibits to compare relative strengths and weaknesses.  Five baseline
              exhibits, plus four variations of each, will be tested on groups of visitors,
              including adults, children and mixed groups of both.
