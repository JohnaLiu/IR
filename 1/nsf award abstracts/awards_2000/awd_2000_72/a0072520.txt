The PI will study the topology of certain
              algebraic 
varieties by methods of Poisson geometry.  Many interesting
              
varieties admit Poisson structures such that the closures 
of the symplectic
              leaves for such structures additively 
generate the homology.  Moreover, one
              can ask for certain 
quite strong invariance and asymptotic properties of
              those
Poisson structures so that the complete information about 
the
              (equivariant) cohomology of these varieties may be 
obtained by studying the
              corresponding Poisson harmonic 
forms.  In addition, if the algebraic variety
              in question 
is smooth and has an invariant Kaehler structure such that 
the
              Kaehler form is compatible in a certain sense with 
the Poisson structure,
              then one can hope to find such 
Poisson structures on the GIT quotients of the
              variety 
using the correspondence between the symplectic and GIT 
quotients. 
              In addition, one can hope to study the Chow 
quotients by similar methods. 
              One also hopes to obtain 
new integrable systems in this context or throw a
              new 
light on already known ones.  The varieties which fall 
into the scope
              of interest of this project include (partial) 
flag manifolds, the moduli
              spaces of parabolic bundles, 
toric varieties, and others.  There is also a
              connection 
between these topics and formal geometry and deformation
              
quantization. 

The PI would like to understand the topology (underlying
              
structure) of certain spaces that appear in different 
branches of science
              such as geometry and theoretical physics. 
The results that PI intends to
              obtain are likely to 
have applications to topological, conformal, and quantum
              
field theories, as well as strings and mirror symmetry. 
In these endeavors
              the PI plans to apply methods of 
algebraic and differential geometry and the
              formal 
algebraic apparatus. The spaces under investigation come 
naturally
              equipped with rich algebraic and geometric 
structures.  Some of these spaces
              appear as quite 
classical objects (like grassmannians) and some of them 
are
              more sophisticated (like moduli spaces). The PI is 
looking forward to further
              unveiling these 
structures and relating them to known phenomena 
sometimes
              crossing interdisciplinary borders.
