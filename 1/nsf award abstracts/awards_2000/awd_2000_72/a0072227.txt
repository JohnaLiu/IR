Two topics in pion-nucleon physics will be experimentally
              investigated at the TRIUMF meson facility. In one, we will make a complete
              kinematical study of electron-positron pair production following capture of
              negative pions by the proton. At the low energies of this experiment, the
              virtual photon produced by pion capture 
probes the axial currents of the
              nucleon. By measuring the electron and positron momenta, the complete
              kinematics of the virtual photon are determined. This allows the cross section
              to be decomposed into the longitudinal, transverse, and various interference
              response functions characteristic of pion electroproduction experiments. In the
              present experiment, however, the axial structure of the nucleon is uniquely
              determined at small time-like momenta from the measured response functions.
              Recent claims of a violation of isospin symmetry in the low energy pion-nucleon
              interaction will be investigated experimentally. Under isospin symmetry, the
              amplitude for elastic pion-nucleon scattering determines the
pion
              charge-exchange cross section. We will make new low energy measurements of the
              forward-angle neutral pion yield following negative pion interactions in liquid
              hydrogen. The pion yield and angular distribution are determined from the
              measured decay gamma-ray energy spectrum, which will be measured in a new high
              resolution sodium-iodide spectrometer.
