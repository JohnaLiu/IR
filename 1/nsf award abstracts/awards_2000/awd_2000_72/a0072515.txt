Abstract


	The proposers are interested in geometric and
              topological properties of hyperbolic 3-manifolds arising from the Bianchi
              groups, and more generally in the properties of arithmetically-defined 
              3-manifolds. The proposers intend to unify two of the main themes of research
              in this area, namely, the cuspidal cohomology problem with non-trivial
              coefficients, and the enumeration and description of immersed totally geodesic
              surfaces. The proposers intend to explore possible connections between
              non-vanishing results in cuspidal cohomology and generalized bending
              deformations supported on totally geodesic surfaces.



	The Bianchi groups
              are particularly interesting mathematical objects as they lie at the crossroads
              of several distinct area of pure mathematics: number theory, infinite group
              theory, geometry, and topology. They have been studies from these diverse
              points of view for more than one hundred years.
	Certain three-dimensional
              spaces arise in a natural way from the Bianchi groups; these spaces come
              equipped with a "hyperbolic geometry". This, in a nutshell, means that pairs of
              straight lines generically diverge from one another unlike Euclidean
              geometry.
	Three-dimensional spaces with a hyperbolic geometry are central to
              the study of general three-dimensional spaces as they represent, in a certain
              sense, the "generic" examples. Hyperbolic spaces are among the most difficult
              to understand, and therefore the proposers aim to elucidate the geometry of
              these important examples mentioned above.
