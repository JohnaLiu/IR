	Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the accepted theory of
              the
strong interactions of quarks and gluons. At low energies the quarks
and
              gluons are confined in baryons (three quarks) and mesons
(quark--antiquark
              pairs), and understanding the properties and
interactions of baryons and
              mesons  in terms of QCD is of fundamental importance.
	QCD possess a number of
              elementary symmetries.  They include isospin symmetry, whereby the interactions
              are unaltered by u,d quark flavor rotations, and chiral symmetry, whereby the
              interactions are unaltered by separate flavor rotations  for left, right handed
              quarks.  The realization of these symmetries is rich and varied, involving
              so-called spontaneous, explicit and anomalous  symmetry breaking effects. 
              Understanding their realization is central to understanding the low energy 
              interactions of baryons and mesons.
	This experimental research addresses the
              manifestation of symmetries in low energy processes. At the TRIUMF Laboratory
              in Vancouver, Canada we are investigating chiral and isospin symmetries with
              beams of muons and pions. For example the weak interaction between muons and
              protons  is a key test of chiral symmetry breaking  and the strong interaction
              between pions and protons is central to understanding the breaking of isospin.
              In addition, at the Jefferson Laboratory in Newport News, Virginia we are
              collaborating on a precision measurement of the decay rate of the neutral pion
              - a unique test of anomalous symmetry breaking in QCD.
