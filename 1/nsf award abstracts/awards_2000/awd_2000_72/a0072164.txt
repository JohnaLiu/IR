Professor Escobar proposes to work in three different
              variational
problems: The first one is on conformal deformation of
metrics.
              He proposes to work on the scalar curvature problem on
scalar flat manifolds
              of dimension five or more.  In addition, he
will study the prescribed scalar
              curvature and prescribed mean
curvature problem on manifolds with boundary;
              particular
attention will be given to this problem when the manifold is
              the
Euclidean ball and the dimension is three.  Earlier
investigations
              indicate that the problem in three dimensions is
special. The second topic he
              proposes to study is estimates for
the first non-zero Steklov eigenvalue on
              compact manifolds with
boundary. Escobar proposes to study relations between
              the
geometry of the space and the first non-zero eigenvalue and apply
this
              information to problems in conformal geometry, heat flow
problems, and to the
              study of eigenvalues of minimal
surfaces. The third topic is to study Einstein
              metrics on
manifolds with boundary. There are three different kinds
              of
equations that arise naturally as a variational problem of a
functional
              introduced by the proposer; they are Einstein metrics
satisfying that the
              boundary is totally geodesic or, more
generally, that the boundary is umbilic,
              and Ricci flat metrics
with umbilic boundary.

The three problems above have
              their roots in Riemannian geometry
as well as in physics. The Steklov problem
              initially appeared in
physics, then in harmonic analysis, partial
              differential
equations, conformal geometry, and minimal surfaces.  In
              physics,
it describes the temperature of a body where the flux through
              out
the boundary is proportional to the temperature. We will
investigate how
              the geometry of the space influence the first
non-zero eigenvalue, that is,
              the smallest nonzero constant of
proportionality. The Einstein equation
              proposed in this project
is the generalization of the Einstein's equation in
              boundaryless
spaces studied by Hilbert and Einstein in general relativity
              to
the case of spaces with boundary.  The boundary conditions we
will imposed
              are the natural ones if one studies this problem
from the point of view of the
              calculus of variations. The scalar
curvature equations that we will
              investigate are the average
version of the Einstein equation on manifolds with
              boundary.
Nowadays they are known as the Yamabe type equations.
              These
equations appear in relativity and in other branches of physics.
