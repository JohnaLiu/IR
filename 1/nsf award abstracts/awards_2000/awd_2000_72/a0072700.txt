The main objective of the principal
              investigator's 
research program is the unification of topology and 
geometry
              with analysis.  He is especially interesing 
in specific results describing
              some phenomena in 
real world physics where topological features play a
key
              role. In particular, such phenomena were found by the 
principal
              investigators's group in the conductivity of 
single crystal metals in the
              presence of  strong magnetic 
field, in the theory of nonlinear waves
              (solitons), and in 
the theory of quantum wires (quantum mechanics on graphs).
              

This award will support visitors and graduate students in
the principal
              investigator's school of mathematics which is
primarily concerned with the
              unification of topology and
geometry with analysis.  In this way young
              mathematicians can
interact with a variety of outstanding scientists.  These
              
interactions include scientific meetings with visitors in 
miniseminars and
              attendance at short series of lectures by 
specially invited outstanding
              scientists.  These interactions 
will help attract graduate students to the
              subject and improve 
the quality of their training at the beginning of their
              careers.
