     Lava domes are a common geological formation, and
              their
geometry sets them apart as one of the more simple types of lava
flow. 
              Moreover, domes often have a relatively low aspect ratio
and evolve slowly. 
              These observations can be used as ingredients
in building simple mathematical
              models of expanding and cooling
fluid domes; this proposal surrounds the
              development of such
models.  In particular, lava is considered as a
              solidifying,
non-Newtonian fluid with strongly temperature-dependent
              material
qualities and an intrinsic yield stress.  The wide array of
physical
              ingredients to the problem make the mathematical
modelling especially
              challenging.  The project exploits the simple
geometry, slow evolution and low
              aspect ratio of the dome to
asymptotically reduce the governing equations to a
              simpler form.
The reduction furnishes "shallow-lava equations," in much
              the
same way that the "shallow-ice equations" are derived and
extensively
              used to model ice sheets and glaciers.  Differences
arise because of the
              viscoplastic nature of silicic lava, and
because solidification creates a
              solid crust overlying the dome
that can contribute significantly to the
              balance of forces,
especially at the disk's edge.  The mathematical approach
              are
complemented with an experimental one in which laboratory fluids
are used
              as analogue models of the lava.  Both approaches are used
to explore the
              structure and evolution of the dome, partly with
the aim of learning more
              about how lava behaves as a fluid.  For
example, some domes lose axisymmetry
              in what might be an
intrinsic morphological instability; this pattern
              formation
process is explored in that light.
     Lava domes occur in many
              geological settings both on Earth
and on many other planets and moons of the
              solar system.  These
structures form when crystal-rich silicic magma is pushed
              up
through vents onto roughly horizontal surfaces, and often occur
inside the
              craters created by volcanic eruptions.  The shape of a
lava dome is especially
              simple in comparison to most other lava
flows.  Hence, a first step in
              understanding lava flows in general
is to explore those domes.  Moreover,
              despite their slow growth,
domes are natural hazards because they can be the
              setting of
violent and dangerous events: domes can rupture and
              release
confined gas in a pyroclastic outflow (an extremely hot
              and
fast-moving current of air and ash), or collapse at their
peripheries to
              create landslides and debris flows.  The proposal
outlines a mathematical and
              experimental approach to the
modelling of lava domes.  The purpose is to build
              models of the
dome's structure and evolution, and compare these models with
              the
real geological structures.  By modelling the domes in this way,
more
              will be learned about how lava flows, and ultimately this
may provide insight
              into the hazards associated with them.
