The
              principal investigator proposes to study a number of
classical problems in
              Riemannian geometry that are related in
that they may be described by, or have
              a strong connection with,
fully nonlinear elliptic equations such as
              Monge-Ampere equations
or mean curvature equations in some novel way. These
              include
extensions of the classical sharp isoperimetric inequality
              to
negatively curved Riemannian manifolds, hypersurfaces of constant
mean
              curvature in hyperbolic space with prescribed boundary at
infinity, and the
              problem of deciding if any local Riemannian
metric can be realized by an
              embedding into Euclidean three
dimensional space. This last problem is
              interesting not only for
its geometric content but also for important concrete
              problems in
computer vision.

Our research is motivated by concrete
              geometric and physical
problems that are of basic interest to pure and
              applied
scientists.  What are the basic geometric design
              principles
(variational principles) that govern the structure of the
              protein
in our genes and can we find a fast computational algorithm
              to
predict this structure. How can we make better color computer
screens and
              smart cameras.  These questions and numerous others
depend upon a deep
              understanding of the geometry of surfaces and
the complicated nonlinear
              equations that describe how they twist
and turn and move about in space. The
              effective solution of these
problems involves the study of geometry, partial
              differential
equations and high speed computation.
