Columbia University-Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory
              (CU-LDEO) will operate the R/V Ewing during 2000 as a general oceanographic
              research vessel in support of NSF-supported research projects.  The Ewing is a
              230 ft. vessel, constructed in 1983 and was modified in 1990, and is owned by
              NSF and operated by CU-LDEO.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 267
              operational days during 2000, of which all days are in support of NSF-supported
              investigators.  The projects scheduled on the Ewing represent several
              oceanographic disciplines, mainly MG&G, and will fully utilize the capabilities
              of the vessel.  Operations will begin in the Pacific:  Lyttelton, New Zealand;
              Papua, New Guinea; and then the Pacific Coast off of Central America.  The
              Ewing will then transit through the Panama Canal to New Foundland to conduct a
              two ship operation with the R/V Oceanus, and to the Florida coast.  During the
              period from October-December, the vessel will be in lay-up to commence Phase I
              of a mid-life refit.

The Ewing is part of a fleet of ships used by the
              National Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most
              oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to be permanently
              installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These
              vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a
              result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated
              to oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions
              around the country.
