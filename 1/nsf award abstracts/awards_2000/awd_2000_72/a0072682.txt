Abstract    :
              The Flora of China is a collaborative international project to publish the first
              modern English-language account of more than 30,000 species of vascular plants
              of China.  It marks a new stage in the promotion of international botanical
              interchange.  All taxonomic treatments are jointly co-authored by Chinese and
              non-Chinese botanists.  Nearly 150 Chinese botanists and 500 non-Chinese
              botanists are involved in the project.  The project will eventually result in
              publication of 25 volumes of text and illustrations.  Family accounts will be
              made available on the web, and a fully searchable database of species accounts,
              distribution maps, and other data will enable browsing.  This authoritative
              information will be used worldwide by scientists in basic and applied research,
              as well as by those working in conservation, land management, horticulture, and
              medicine.
