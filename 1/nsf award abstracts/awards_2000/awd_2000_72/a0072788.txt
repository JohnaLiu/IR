Abstract    :
              he focus of this research is the development of asymmetric methods for synthesis
              using boronic acid chemistry and, as an example, the stereocontrolled synthesis
              of small rings via cyclization of chloro boronic esters to enolates will be
              probed.  The borosilicate glass surface catalyzed  ligand exchange that
              converts stable boronic esters to alkylboron chloride amine complexes plus diol
              sulfites will also be studied in order to affect the recovery of valuable
              chiral directors.  Further, this reaction also has potential for converting
              highly hindered asymmetric boronic esters into more reactive borane
              derivatives.

With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Donald S. Matteson of the
              Department of Chemistry at Washington State University.  Professor Matteson
              will focus his work on developing asymmetric synthesis methodology using 
              boronic ester chemistry.  The area of research is excellent for the training of
              graduate students and the results of the research could have implications for
              the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.
