This effort involves a close research interaction between
              dislocation 
mechanics modeling and novel processing and transmission electron
              
microscrope experiments that will lead to a fundamental understanding 
of
              deformation mechanisms in layered nanomaterials.  A principal goal 
of this
              research is to understand the limiting strength of such 
materials to plastic
              deformation, as the thickness of individual 
layers in the structure are
              decreased to the nanometer scale.  To do 
so, the investigators will observe
              directly the generation, motion, 
and interaction of dislocations in layered
              nanomaterials over a range 
of individual layer thickness.  Particular
              attention will be given to 
the critical conditions for which interfaces are
              no longer able to 
confine dislocation motion to individual layers.  These
              observations 
will couple closely with theoretical treatments of the
              nucleation and 
motion of dislocations in confined layer geometries, and the
              critical 
stress to transmit slip across grain boundaries and interfaces. 
              This 
research will extend our knowledge of how to develop ultra-high
              
strength two-phase layered nanomaterials through the choice of 
phases, the
              scale at which they are employed, and the structure of 
the interfaces and
              grain boundaries which serve to confine 
dislocation motion.
