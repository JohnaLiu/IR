Abstract    :
              The Bryophyte Flora of North America is a biotic survey by North America
              bryologists intended to provide an authoritative, re-evaluated summary, both as
              electronic Web-accessible databases and in hardcopy printed volumes, of the
              names, taxonomy, and geographic distributions of the nearly 1900 species of
              mosses, hornworts, and hepatics found north of Mexico through Canada and
              including Greenland.  The Flora will result in a floristic digital library to
              be maintained in perpetuity and providing an environment that promotes and
              facilitates future research in biodiversity, floristics, ecology, conservation,
              taxonomy, and phylogenetics.  Additional research products include a
              three-volume illustrated printed edition with distribution maps, online
              multiple access electronic keys, GIS-based floristic data, and other
              informational electronic databases.  The work will be an essential tool for the
              identification of mosses, liverworts, and hornworts in its printed and
              updateable, long-term electronic form.
