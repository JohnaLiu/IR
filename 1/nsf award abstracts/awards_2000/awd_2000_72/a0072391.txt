	In many research facilities such as JLAB, LEGS, GRAAL, DESY,
              SAL, MAMI, and INS, which have scheduled experiments with polarized photon
              beam, there is a need for accurate polarization measurements in short time
              periods. Unfortunately at present, no adequate method is available at the
              higher energies characteristic of such facilities. At energies above ~ 600 MeV
              all known method have small analyzing power, and significant amount of time is
              required for polarization measurements. 
	At the lower energies the pair
              production method off nuclei is
known to be the most promising. However,
              because the opening angle between the electron-positron pair decreases as the
              energy of the photon increases, this method has not been applied to higher
              energies. We propose to improve the pair production method at lower energies,
              and to extend it to higher energies, by taking advantage of new development in
              microstrip detectors technologies. The proposed polarimeter will have an
              analyzing power of the ~ 1.7 for a broad energy range, from few MeV up to
              several GeV. The proposed polarimeter is simple in construction and its costs
              will be lower than for polarimeters built on any of the other
              available
methods.
