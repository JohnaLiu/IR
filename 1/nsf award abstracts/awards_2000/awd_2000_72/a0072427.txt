Abstract    :
              0072427  Loge  The objective of this research is to develop a method of
              assessing the penetration of selected chemical disinfectants into particles
              developed during water treatment using scanning confocal laser microscopy. 
              Findings from the experimental approach will be coupled with a mathematical
              model to generate a set of guidelines directly applicable to the water industry
              for assessing the biological quality of post-disinfected waters.  This research
              is motivated by the desire to shift the focus from evaluating the survival of
              selected pathogens and indicator organisms as a measure of disinfection to a
              particle-based standard.  With this approach, the dose of the applied
              disinfectant would be based on the frequency and distribution of particles in
              suspension.  All particles greater than a critical particle size (defined as
              the smallest particle capable of shielding an associated organism from the
              applied disinfectant) would be treated as being equally capable of harboring
              one of more targeted organisms of interest.  The dose would be modified to
              insure a specified level of penetration of the applied disinfectant. ***
