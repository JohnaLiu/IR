This
              project is concerned with the study of qualitative properties of solutions of
              differential systems and dynamical equations on time scales.  The theory of
              calculus on measure chains treats continuous, discrete, and more general
              situations in a unified way.  A central theme of the study is the unification
              of discrete and continuous formulations.  The research investigates: (1)
              oscillation, nonoscillation, and disconjugacy properties of solutions of self
              adjoint systems and generalized Hamiltonian systems arising in a number of
              areas of applied mathematics, including calculus of variations, control theory,
              filtering theory, and continued fractions; (2) extension of existence,
              uniqueness, and multiplicity results for solutions to nonlinear boundary value
              problems via fixed point theorems of cone expansion/compression type and
              methods applicable to monotone operators in abstract spaces; (3) the structure
              of positive solutions of nonlinear boundary value problems; and (4) problems
              related to singular dynamical equations on a measure chain.

In scientific
              investigation of natural phenomena, mathematical models are used to give
              quantitative descriptions and to furnish predictions.  One form such models can
              take is a dynamic equation on a measure chain. This project provides new
              insight into the relationship between continuous and discrete descriptions of
              phenomena, and has application to many fields, including mathematical biology
              and economics.  In one application, a study of population growth, we will give
              conditions that ensure survival of a population, in particular for the case in
              which parents die before offspring are hatched. Two well-known examples of this
              are the seventeen-year cicada and the common mayfly.
