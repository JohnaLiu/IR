              ABSTRACT

This proposal concerns parameter estimation methodology for
              an
important class of statistical models.  These models, which we refer
to as
              ``generalized hierarchical models'' (GHMs), have proven to be
extremely useful
              in a wide range of scientific endeavors.  Specific
examples of applications
              that have appeared in the scientific
literature include: the impact of passive
              smoking, changes in voting
behavior, clinical trials for a treatment for
              epilepsy, social surveys
of households in rural China, sheep cloning
              experiments, the
estimation of animal abundance and the analysis of
              multivariate
survival data.

A general purpose algorithm for estimation
              called EM
(expectation-maximization) is particularly suited to the GHM
              setting.
However, implementation the algorithm is complicated because it
              often
involves the calculation of intractable multi-dimensional
              integrals.
Two methods for dealing with these integrals that have received
              some
attention recently are Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) and
              Stochastic
Approximation EM (SAEM).  Both methods involve replacing
              intractable
integrals by Monte Carlo approximations.  Unfortunately,
              applications
of the these Monte Carlo fitting algorithms to GHMs can often
              take
hours or even days to converge.  This has limited their widespread
              use
so far.  The situation will no doubt improve with the availability
              of
faster computers.  However, the development of much faster
              algorithms
would accelerate this process tremendously.  Hence, the
              proposed
research concerns a detailed comparison of the MCEM and
              SAEM
algorithms with a view towards substantially improving
              their
performance.
