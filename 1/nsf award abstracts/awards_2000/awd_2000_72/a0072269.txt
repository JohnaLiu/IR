Abstract:
The principle
              investigator proposes to focus on three well-known open
problems in
              set-theoretic topology: M. Husek's 1977 question of whether
compact spaces
              having a small diagonal are metrizable, J. Steprans'
fifteen-year old problem
              concerning the existence of uncountable
non-discrete spaces which are
              homeomorphic to each of their uncountable
subspaces, and J. Ceder's forty year
              old problem of whether stratifiable
spaces have a sigma-closure preserving
              base.  All three questions involve
fundamental topological properties and
              constructions; they lie in the
mainstream of set-theoretic topology and have
              been worked on by many
researchers.   The principle investigator has
              significant partial results
on all of them which answer related questions and
              give hope for further
progress.  In particular, he has settled the first
              question for countably
compact spaces, affirmatively answered a countable
              version of the second
question, and with respect to the third question has
              obtained several
important results including a positive answer to a closely
              related
question of Ceder.    

Set theory and general topology are
              fundamental mathematical disciplines
with common turn-of-the-century roots. 
              General topology provides a
framework for the study of shapes, from ordinary
              structures in standard
three-dimensional space to much more abstract shapes,
              and the continuous
deformations of these shapes.  Dramatic advances in set
              theory and logic
during the past forty years have led to the realization that
              many
long-standing questions in the general topology of abstract spaces rest
              on
complicated set-theoreti combinatorics and often cannot be solved
assuming
              only the standard axioms of set theory.  Thus began a fruitful
interaction
              between the set theory and general topology which continues
today.    The
              principle investigator's proposed problems lie within the
scope of this
              interesting interaction.   Proposed methods of solutions to
the problems
              involve an interweaving of topological methods with
sophisticated set
              theoretic tools.    Solutions to these problems would
deepen our understanding
              of fundamental topological properties and
relationships, and would likely
              require new set-theoretical and
topological techniques applicable to a variety
              of other problems.
