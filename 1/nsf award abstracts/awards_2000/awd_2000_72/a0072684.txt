Abstract    :
              This project will survey the pyrenomycete fungi of Costa Rica.  These fungi are
              small and inconspicuous, but are an integral part of all forests and other
              ecosystems since they are intimately involved with such basic processes as
              nutrient cycling and decomposition of organic matter.  Information on the
              diversity, systematics, and biogeography of pyrenomycetes is fragmentary, and
              surveys  in most areas of the world are critically needed.  Five areas within
              Costa Rica will be surveyed (Amistad Caribe, Amistad Pacifico, Arenal, Osa,
              Tempisque), and ecompass most of the ecosystems in Costa Rica.  US and Costa
              Rican researchers and students will be trained by the principal investigators,
              and an on-line specimen-based database will be made available through the web.
