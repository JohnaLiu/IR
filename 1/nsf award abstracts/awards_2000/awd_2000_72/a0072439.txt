This project
              focuses on the investigation and development of new computational methods and
              analytical techniques for the modeling and optimal design of photonic crystals
              and related structures.  The objectives of the project are to extend methods
              developed for two-dimensional photonic crystals to the case of
              three-dimensional structures, to develop methods for the optimization of defect
              modes in photonic band gap structures, and to model and analyze the effects of
              dispersive media on wave propagation in periodic structures and study
              associated optimal design problems.  The final objective is to model truncated
              photonic crystals in planar geometries and develop methods to optimize the
              scattering and resonance properties of such structures. 
The structures
              studied in this project are periodic arrangements of optical materials,
              designed to exhibit useful properties with respect to electromagnetic wave
              propagation.  Making use of such structures is a fundamental technology,
              expected to have a significant impact in applications including lasers,
              sensors, optical storage, optical communications, and high-density optical
              interconnects.  This project aims to develop modeling and design capabilities,
              which will improve understanding of the properties of these structures and
              facilitate their incorporation into useful devices.
