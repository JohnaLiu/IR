Research will be carried out in high energy electron
              scattering with
The goal of determining the spin and flavour structure of
              nucleons. The main emphasis will be on studying the strange sea quark
              polarization, the gluon polarization, and transverse polarization effects in
              nucleons. The research will advance our understanding of the nucleons in terms
              of constituent quarks and sea quarks and how they interact with each other to
              form the protons and the neutrons.
