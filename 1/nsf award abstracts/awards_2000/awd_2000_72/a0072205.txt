Abstract    :
              This individual investigator award is to a young PI at Boston College.  The
              experimental project is to study many-body interactions in novel
              two-dimensional electronic materials by using high-resolution angle-resolved
              photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES). More specifically, systematic ARPES studies
              of many-body interactions will be conducted in four different but related
              two-dimensional superconductors - Tl(2)Ba(2)CuO(6+x) thin films with different
              doping levels (Tc about 85K for optimally doped samples), ruthenate (i.e.,
              Sr(2)RuO(4), Tc about 1K), ferromagnetic superconductor RuSr(2)GdCu(2)O(8), and
              layered hafnium nitride (i.e., Li(x)(THF)(y)HfNCl, Tc=25.5K).  Such studies
              will not only answer many questions directly related to these materials, but
              will also advance the understanding of the high temperature superconductivity. 
              The results will provide important information on the understanding of the
              influence of dimensionality on many-body interactions and superconductivity. 
              This research project will also provide good training for both undergraduate
              and graduate students by introducing them some exciting new materials,
              cutting-edge techniques and fundamental condensed matter physics. This training
              will prepare them for a range of careers in academe, industry or
              government.

This individual investigator award is to a young PI at Boston
              College.  The experimental project is to study many-body interactions in some
              newly discovered two-dimensional electronic materials by using high-resolution
              angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES).  Those materials display
              some novel properties, such as high temperature superconductivity - conducting
              electric current with any loss.  Fundamental understanding of these materials
              is important given their great application potential.  ARPES is a powerful
              technique to probe many-body interactions, which are often responsible for
              novel properties of these materials.  Results from this proposal will provide
              important information on the understanding of high temperature
              superconductivity and other interesting phenomena.  This research project will
              also provide good training for both undergraduate and graduate students by
              introducing them some exciting new materials, cutting-edge techniques and
              fundamental condensed matter physics. This training will prepare them for a
              range of careers in academe, industry or government.
