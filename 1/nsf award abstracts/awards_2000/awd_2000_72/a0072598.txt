ABSTRACT:

The aim of this proposal is to make an essential
              
contribution to the mathematical progress of 
three classes of such problems
              by actually 
producing different optimality criteria and 
furnishing
              stability analysis results.  The three 
classes are under three main headings:
              the 
generalized problem of Bolza, the continuous-time 
optimal control, and
              the discrete-time optimal 
control.  The first class, the generalized problem
              of
Bolza, falls in the heart of nonsmooth analysis where 
the regularity of
              the integrand is lacking but 
compensated for by the relative regularity of
              its
Hamiltonian.  Despite the fact that under certain 
hypotheses the second
              class can be viewed as a 
subclass of the first, it is quite beneficial
              to
study this class directly on its own to obtain results 
that take into
              account the special and rich structure 
of the problem.  This direction of
              research produces 
for the optimal control problems, results that are,
              in
general, distinct from those obtained by applying the 
results of the
              generalized problem of Bolza.  Furthermore, 
these two sets of results hold
              for the optimal control 
setting under  different sets of hypotheses.  The
              third 
class of problems is important for numerically solving
              the
continuous-time optimal control problem via discretization.
For the three
              classes, second-order necessary and 
sufficient conditions would be derived in
              terms of a 
quadratical functional, conjugate point theory, and  
a Riccati
              equation.  Furthermore, results on the stability 
and sensitivity of solutions
              to perturbations would be 
investigated.  The Hamilton-Jacobi theory would be
              
employed, as well as the latest techniques from 
variational and nonsmooth
              analysis.


Optimization problems with dynamical structure have become
              
prominent in a variety of disciplines as mathematical 
models of systems
              with time evolution. In particular, 
optimal control theory is a subject that
              was developed in 
the 1950's mainly to deal with applications arising from
              
several disciplines. This includes engineering, operations
management and
              economics. Most problem formulation were 
initially derived from engineering
              considerations which 
lead to the presence of control and state constraints.
              This 
is the case  with the "soft moon landing problem" and 
the "rocket car
              problem". Most recently, the formulation 
of the optimal control problem has
              been adapted to include 
considerations from other areas like management and
              
economics. This accounts for the increased interest in 
optimal control
              problems with constraints containing both 
the state and the control variable.
              Therefore, providing 
new tools and better techniques to tackle these problems
              
and to help in computing their solutions would have an 
important impact on
              the applications emanating from 
those disciplines. This is exactly the goal
              of the present 
proposal. In fact, the intent is to derive optimality
              
criteria for control problems with different types of 
constraints.
              Furthermore, the stability of these criteria 
under small perturbations is
              analysed. This latter is 
crucial for applications, due to the error in
              measurements.
