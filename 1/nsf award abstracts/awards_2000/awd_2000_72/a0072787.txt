This research explores the formation and structure of
              titanium-zirconium based quasicrystals.  There are several facets to the
              program: (1) elastic neutron scattering and NMR studies of quasicrystals that
              are partially loaded with hydrogen and deuterium; (2) examination of the
              Ti-Zr-Ni phase diagram; (3) the transformation mechanisms of transition phases;
              and (4) the nucleation and growth characteristics of the crystal metal hydride
              phases that form during hydrogen cycling.  An attempt is made to model and
              measure quantitatively the time-dependent nucleation rates in selected Ti-Zr
              glasses that crystallize to nanostructured quasicrystals and crystals. In
              addition H and D are used as structural probes for stable AlPdMn and MgZn-rare
              earth quasicrystals to test proposed structural models.

The results of
              these studies are of value to the quasicrystal scientific community and the
              broader materials community.  Insight gained from the crystallization studies
              leads to refinements of new models for nucleation and improved processing
              capabilities for the production of nanostructured materials.
