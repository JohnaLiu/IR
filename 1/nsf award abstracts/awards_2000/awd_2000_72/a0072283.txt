	Understanding the structure of the nucleon at the quark
              level is of
fundamental importance in particle and nuclear physics.  An
              observable
identified as being directly sensitive to  quark degrees of freedom
              is
the cross section difference between the elastic scattering of
              electrons
with polarizations parallel and antiparallel to the incident
              electron
momentum from unpolarized protons.  This parity violating
              asymmetry
results from the interference between the process in which an
              incident
electron exchanges a photon and the one in which it exchanges a
              neutral
weak boson.  Specifically, parity violating elastic electron
              proton
scattering allows determination of the nucleon strange charge
              and
magnetic form factors, which describe the contributions from
              strange
quarks to the nucleon, along with their momentum transfer
              dependence.
If parity violating electron nucleon scattering experiments are
              extended
beyond the elastic channel into particular inelastic
              channels,
additional information about the quark currents inside the nucleon
              can
clearly be obtained.  Understanding the Delta resonance, the
              first
excited nucleon state, has always been considered an important test
              of
nucleon structure models.  The parity violating asymmetry
              in
electroproduction of this resonance can isolate the
              isovector
contributions to the quark currents.  The Delta resonance can also
              be
produced in electron scattering via the exchange of the neutral
              weak
boson.  Thus, weak transition form factors also contribute to
              the
N-to-Delta transition.
	Included in the research efforts of the Louisiana
              Tech Center for
Applied Physics Studies (CAPS) is the study of parity
              violating electron
scattering in both elastic and inelastic reactions.  CAPS
              has
significant involvement in the G0 experiment at Jefferson Lab
              (E00-006),
which will investigate the elastic channel, and are spokespersons
              for
experiment E97-104, ``Measurement of the Parity Violating Asymmetry
              in
the N-to-Delta transition.''
