Abstract    :
              Water is a limiting resource in most natural and managed ecosystems.  A better
              understanding of plant water use is needed for informed management of  the
              integrity and productivity these systems.  The symposium and resultant review
              paper will summarize the recent advances in ecological plant water relations
              and identify essential areas for future research.  At the individual plant
              level, the PIs will address root-to-leaf water transport mechanisms, the role
              hydraulic and chemical signalling in responses to water limitation, and damage
              repair mechanisms.  Additionally the PIs will discuss the impact of individual
              plant water use on the larger scales of community and ecosystem responses.  The
              symposium will serve a broad audience of scientists in research areas ranging
              from plant physiology to ecosystem biology.
