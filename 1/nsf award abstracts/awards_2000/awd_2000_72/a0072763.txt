This is a grant to
              support the 13th annual Conference on Theorem Proving in Higher Order Logics
              (TPHOLs 2000)  to be held at the Oregon Graduate Institute during August
              2000.

This conference will bring together top researchers from around the
              world to discuss higher-order logic theorem provers.   A conference allows new
              ideas to be disseminated more rapidly than is possible through the literature. 
              Applications of this subject include, among others, hardware verification &
              synthesis, and  verification of security & communications protocols.  NSF is
              giving $10,000  for scholarships to subsidize up to 20 students who would
              otherwise be unable to attend.
