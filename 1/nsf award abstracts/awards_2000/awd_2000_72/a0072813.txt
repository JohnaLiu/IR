This grant supports the work of a female condensed matter
              theorist from a non-Ph.D. granting department and is a co-funding decision with
              the PHY division.  The research program concerns the behavior of energy
              eigenvalues and wavefunctions of a particle moving in a 1-dimensional
              aperiodic/quasiperiodic potential, especially one where the departure from
              periodicity arises as a result of more than one competing length scales.   The
              focus is on the change of character of wavefunctions.  In a strictly periodic
              system, the wavefunctions are all extended/delocalized.  In a random system,
              they are localized.  There must be a changeover, which can be studied by
              looking at these a/quasi periodic structures.  There are several projects on a
              variety of lattices, which consider the effects of many competing length scales
              as well as of quantum interference.  Further there are plans to generalize and
              study these effects in two dimensions.

This mid-career female member of
              the faculty at a non-Ph.D. granting department has been well known for her work
              on the motion of  a particle in 1-dimension in an aperiodic or quasiperiodic
              potential well.  The main objective here is to connect the two extremes:  In a
              periodic system we know that the particle motion is largely periodic and
              log-range. In a random system, the particle motion is not long range.  The
              objective here is to consider how the changeover occurs.  There are also
              projects to study quantum effects and possible extensions to 2-dimensions, e.g.
              in thin films.
