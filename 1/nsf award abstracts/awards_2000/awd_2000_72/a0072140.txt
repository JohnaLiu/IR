This U.S. Mexico award will support a research collaboration
              between Drs. Walter Oeschel, Douglas Deutschman, and Paul Ganster of San Diego
              State University and Dr. Arturo Muhlia Melo and his group at the Centro de
              Investigaciones Biologicas del Noroeste (CIBNOR) in La Paz, Baja California,
              Mexico.  The overall objective of the research is to develop the capability to
              predict current and future patterns of vegetation and ecosystem function in the
              arid and semi-arid ecosystems of the La Paz and San Diego regions.  Specific
              objectives include determining the inter- and intra annual pattern of ecosystem
              carbon dioxide flux and water use in Southern California and Baja California,
              using ecosystem landscape models to predict current and future carbon and water
              flux of the region and validating them with field sampling and aircraft
              measurement of regional gas and water fluxes and remote sensing. 

Semi-arid
              ecosystems are often centers of bio-diversity, of rare and endangered species,
              and are particularly sensitive to the impacts of global change.  The proposed
              collaboration will integrate current activities on each side of the border,
              building on the complementary expertise at SDSU and CIBNOR, and linking results
              of scientific research to the socio-economic context, local, national, and
              international policy.
