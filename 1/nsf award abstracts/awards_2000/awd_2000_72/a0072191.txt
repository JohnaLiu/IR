In a program of analytical and computational investigations,
              the 
investigator will develop control theory to make jet engines lighter,
              more 
efficient and safer. Surge and stall are instabilities in the flow of
              air 
through the engines; flutter is an oscillation of the blades compressing
              the 
air. These instabilities decrease the efficiency of the engine and can be
              
dangerous. The control theory aims at controlling all of these
              instabilities.

If lighter, more fuel efficient and safer aircraft engines
              are to be made the 
current technology needs to be improved. This research
              tries to 
accomplishes this goal by first developing a mathematical model for
              the 
jet engine, then simulating this model of the engine on a computer and
              
using the results to figure out how to design a much more efficient and
              
safer jet engine. Then this design is implemented and checked in the
              
laboratory. Similar technology is also used to compress rocket fuel before
              
combustion and an optimization of the technology as a whole may lead to
              
cheaper space travel.
