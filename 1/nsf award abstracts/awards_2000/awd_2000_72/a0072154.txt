Riemannian geometry is the study of curved spaces.
              
Examples of such spaces are curves and surfaces in 
three-dimensional flat
              space. Riemann showed how to
make precise the notion of curvature for a space
              of 
arbitrary dimension.  Spectral analysis can be roughly 
characterized as
              the study of how a space vibrates.  
More precisely, to a curved space is
              associated a certain 
partial differential operator, the Laplacian.  Spectral
              
analysis is the study of how the eigenvalues of the 
Laplacian depend on the
              underlying geometry of the space.

In previous work, the principal
              investigator obtained 
relationships between the spectrum of the differential
              
form Laplacian and the geometry of the underlying space, 
the latter being
              constrained by upper bounds on its diameter
and upper and lower bounds on its
              curvature. In particular, 
he characterized when there are uniform upper
              bounds on the 
j-th eigenvalue of the p-form Laplacian, and when there are
              
small positive eigenvalues of the p-form Laplacian.  He 
proposes to extend
              this work in several directions.  One 
direction is to just assume that there
              is a lower bound 
on the curvature of the space.  New issues arise in this
              
case, as under the assumed geometric constraints, the space 
can
              ``collapse'' to a highly singular space of lower 
dimension.  The principal
              investigator's previous work, 
in the case of upper and lower curvature
              bounds, also dealt 
with the singular spaces that arise in a collapsing limit.
               
However, with just a lower curvature bound, the singular
spaces that arise
              are of a different nature. He also proposes 
to extend the previous work in
              the direction of analyzing 
the spectrum of the Dirac operator, under the
              geometric 
assumptions of an upper bound on the diameter of the space
and
              upper and lower bounds on its curvature.
