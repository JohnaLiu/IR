Tropical forests may remain species-rich due to the limited
              regenerative capacity of individual species. If, in general, tree seeds
              establish sparsely, or in locations unsuitable for long-term growth, such
              limited regeneration precludes individual species dominance. Studies of seed
              dispersal and survival patterns can identify factors that limit tree
              regeneration. In particular, this project will experimentally test how seed
              density and desirability affect seed eating by rodents. Most tropical tree
              seeds are dispersed in varying densities by animals, and seeds of different
              species differ strongly in desirability. Marked seeds of a test species will be
              placed in different densities and in seed mixes of two species differing in
              desirability. To determine the effect of density and desirability on seed fate,
              these marked seeds will be censused over time and compared to seeds protected
              from rodents. 

This project will contribute to an ecological understanding
              of seed plant diversity in general by testing a broad hypothesis in a diverse
              plant community. Results will help determine if limited individual regenerative
              capacities can explain the maintenance of species diversity in a variety of
              ecosystems. In addition, investigations of seed mortality can be applied to
              managing composition of tree species in remnant as well as natural forests.
