Abstract    :
              The American Chemical Society Symposium on  New Synthetic Methods in Solid-State
              Chemistry will be held in San Francisco, CA March 26-31, 2000.  The goal of the
              conference is to facilitate multidisciplinary interactions and information
              exchange within a broad spectrum of researchers, to include CAREER  grantees,
              and top post doctoral scholars and graduate students working in priority areas
              of the broad field of solid-state chemistry. The NSF funds will be used to
              support the attendance of young Pi's,  graduate students and post doctoral
              scholars.

The Solid State Chemistry community continues to have direct
              impact on important  technological areas  that are crucial to advancing society
              through the design, synthesis and application new materials. Examples include
              porous solids for catalysis,  thin films for electronics and electrooptic
              devices, and nanostructured materials for high-strength composite structural
              materials.  Since these technical areas are of very high priority to industry, 
              students educated and trained in these multidisciplinary areas involving
              solid-state chemistry compete very well in the job market and go on  to
              contribute in many significant ways to the global economy.
