For nearly 40 years, beginning with work by H. Wang and R.
              Berger, the
undecidability of certain questions regarding tilings and
              aperiodic
tilings have been studied.  But as we extend our horizons and
              consider
tilings in more general contexts than the Euclidean Plane, we see
              that
many foundational questions are still open.  In any
              particular,
reasonably well-defined setting (e.g., "tilings in the
              hyperbolic
plane by polygonal tiles, moved about by
              orientation-preserving
isometries"), there are several intertwined questions
              that may be
asked: 1) Is there a general method to determine whether a given
              set
of prototiles admits a tiling that includes a specified
              configuration?
(Is the "Completion Problem" decidable?; 2) Is there a general
              method
to determine whether a given set of prototiles can tile the space
              at
all?  (Is the "Domino Problem" decidable?)  3) Is there a
              "weakly
aperiodic" protoset? (Such a protoset admits no tiling with a
              compact
fundamental domain.); 4) Is there a "strongly aperiodic"
              protoset?
(Such a protoset admits no tiling that is invariant under
              an
infinite-cyclic symmetry); 5) Is there a computable bound on the
Heesch
              number of protosets?; Is there a computable bound on the
isohedral number of
              protosets?; 7) Is the period problem decidable?
We consider conjectures
              concerning some of these questions in two
settings that have been thought
              about for 20 years: protosets in the
hyperbolic plane and monotiles in the
              Euclidean plane; and we sketch a
number of proposed approaches to these
              problems.  We feel these
techniques should generalize and shed light on many
              foundation al
issues in discrete geometry.

We hope the project will be
              significant in several ways.  First, these
problems, which have largely been
              seen as isolated from each other,
can all be seen as tightly connected.  It is
              anticipated that
techniques will arise that will shed light on several aspects
              of this
problem.  But moreover, the techniques under consideration may
              link
these questions in several topics in low-dimensional geometric
topology
              and combinatorial algebra.  Finally, questions of
decidability and
              tractability are one of the central concerns of
theoretical computer science;
              form one point of view, we are simply
exploring a particular example, but hope
              that the techniques we
develop will be of more general use.
