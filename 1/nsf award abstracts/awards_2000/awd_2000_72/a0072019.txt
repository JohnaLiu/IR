Abstract    :
              A conference on "Nuclear Waste and Energy" will be held in mid-July, 2000  in
              New London, New Hampshire, as part of the Gordon Research Conferences series.
              This conference will address topics of high scientific interest and of  great
              practical importance. The number of young scientists  being trained in the
              science and technology of nuclear waste is not sufficient to meet the needs of
              the United States. NSF support will make it possible for a number of younger
              investigators to attend the conference.
