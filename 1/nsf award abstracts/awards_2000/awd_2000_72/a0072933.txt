This workshop award supports twenty junior researchers from the
              U.S. to participate in a German-American Frontiers of Chemistry workshop in
              Kloster Seeon near Munich, Germany.  The purpose of the workshop is to bring
              together junior scientists in the area of chemical technologies.  The meeting
              intends to establish a strong foundation for future research and to develop
              German-American scientific relations.  This type of workshop is particularly
              important because relative to the 60s and 70s, fewer U.S. junior scientists are
              visiting German laboratories.  Yet it remains important to share in the latest
              research practiced in Germany, particularly since Germany is at the cutting
              edge in certain subfields such as chemical synthesis, catalysis, molecular
              self-assembly, nanomaterials, functional polymers, and genomics.
