This project involves the study of Poisson
              structures
using the theory of  Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids, 
in
              particular, Poisson groupoids and Lie bialgebroids.
The theory of Poisson
              groupoids was developed as a 
unification of both Drinfel'd's Poisson group
              theory 
and the theory of symplectic groupoids of Karasev-Weinstein.
The
              investigator aims to apply this theory to study 
integrable systems such as
              Calogero-Moser systems.  He will 
also continue his study on Courant
              algebroids and Dirac 
structures from the viewpoint of  Dirac generating
              operators,
as applied to objects in  Poisson geometry  such as moment 
maps
              and equivariant cohomology.  This project also involves 
the study of
              deformation quantization, in particular on quantum groupoids.  More
              specifically, it includes the  study of universal enveloping algebras of
              Courant algebroids, Kontsevich's formality
type conjecture for Lie algebroids,
              and cohomology theory of deformation of Hopf algebroids, all  of which are
              components in quantization of Lie bialgebroids.  An important  application is
              to study quantization of  classical dynamical r-matrices.

Poisson geometry
              is largely motivated by physics, which is
in fact a mathematical tool used to
              give a theoretical framework 
encompassing large parts of classical mechanics.
              Quantization
is developed  in order to gain a better understanding
              between
classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. At present, Poisson
              
geometry finds various applications including control theory, 
machining
              automation and robotic manipulation.
