Abstract    :
              Modern processors improve instruction level parallelism by speculation. The
              outcome of data and control decisions is predicted, and the operations are
              speculatively executed and only committed if the original predictions were
              correct. There are a number of other ways that processor resources could be
              used, such as threading or eager execution.  As the use of speculation
              increases, more processors will need some form of speculation control to
              balance the benefits of speculation against other possible activities.  This
              research examines a set of microarchitectural features that can benefit from
              speculation control, including trace formation; instruction fetch management,
              execution resource management and memory access prioritization.  The research
              also explores how out-of-order processor designs can use multi-voltage levels
              to reduce energy, and how the processor can provide feedback to an operating
              system that further controls energy use via dynamic voltage scaling.  This work
              is done using a microarchitectural model that supports multithreading and
              multiprocessor simulations. This work is part of a broader effort that includes
              experimentation with existing computers, design and modification of operating
              systems for energy efficiency and the adoption of microarchitectural models
              designed for comparing energy efficient processor designs.
