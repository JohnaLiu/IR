The award will partially support U.S.
              participants in  the Year 2000 International Conference on Dynamical Systems
              and Differential Equations held at Kennesaw State University 18 - 21 May 2000. 
              The International Conferences on Dynamical Systems and Differential Equations
              have been during their five-year history an excellent platform for worldwide
              communication and interchange of ideas in the fields of Dynamical Systems and
              Differential Equations. This year, ten well-known mathematicians from six
              countries will give plenary lectures.  Fifteen top mathematicians have
              organized thirteen special sessions with more than 120 speakers. It is
              anticipated that more than two hundred mathematicians from more than thirty
              countries will participate in this conference, which also includes many
              contributed talks. The lectures will highlight current areas of research, and
              the participants will identify important problems for future
              investigation.

The subject of this conference is an area that has seen rapid
              expansion in the last two decades, partly due to the advancement of
              computational technology.  Differential equations provide the fundamental
              paradigm for mathematical models of motion, from weather phenomena and ariplane
              flight to the flow of blood through the human heart.  The theory of dynamical
              systems provides means to formulate and to understand the implications of
              models of such systems.  Together, the theories of dynamical systems and
              differential equations form the language of mathematics that is used to
              describe changes in the world around us.  This meeting will bring together
              leading established workers, junior researchers, and advanced graduate students
              to discuss the state of the art and to assess approaches to open problems.
