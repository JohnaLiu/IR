The measurement
              of wall static pressure values is one of the foundational elements of
              experimental fluid dynamics.  This data provide useful diagnostic information
              for a complex flow field and they provide a most important link between CFD and
              experimental observations.  Awarding this equipment grant will make it far
              easier for Utah State University research/instructional faculty to acquire
              static pressure data in their current: i) wing tip vortex studies from a
              lifting body and ii) a transverse curvature channel flow, and their long term
              efforts on experimental work in air flows.  It is expected that this equipment
              will benefit the thesis work and the laboratory instruction of a large number
              of Utah State University students.
