Neural Substrates of
              Behavior

The focus of our multi-disciplinary research program is the
              development of
tools and techniques for multisite intracellular recording in
              freely
behaving animals.  More specifically, we are involved in
              a
multi-investigator effort to implant a microcomputer into the brain of
              a
marine mollusk, for the purpose of recording neuronal signals.  This
              effort
comprises three main thrusts: (1) to develop silicon microcomputers
              that
can record from, and communicate with, multiple neurons in an
              intact
animal; (2) to develop multi-site intracellular probe arrays, and
              the
techniques for attaching these arrays to nervous tissue without
              damaging
either probes or tissue; and (3) to develop neurophysiological
              preparations
and techniques for surgically implanting both microchips and
              probe arrays
in live, freely behaving animals, and for recording from these
              animals in
their natural environment for several hours.
