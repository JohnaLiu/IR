DDIG: Anaerobic microbial metabolism and the
              biogeochemical functioning of wetlands

Microbial decomposition of organic
              matter plays a central role in the functioning of wetlands, and much of this
              decomposition occurs in the absence of oxygen (e.g., anaerobic conditions). 
              Anaerobic microorganisms mediate chemical transformations that alter downstream
              water quality, and emit greenhouse gases such as methane to the atmosphere,
              thereby affecting climate.  By understanding how the nature and rates of
              microbial processes vary across a broad suite of wetland ecosystems, we can
              better predict the impacts of disturbance on the functions of wetlands. This
              research will evaluate these microbial processes in a variety of Michigan
              wetlands. Techniques developed for marine and groundwater studies will be
              employed to determine the dominant microbial processes.  Substances to be
              measured will include dissolved hydrogen gas, a universal intermediary in
              decomposition, as well as chemical byproducts of anaerobic metabolism. Specific
              process rates, including acetate turnover and sulfate reduction, will be
              measured to corroborate the findings.
