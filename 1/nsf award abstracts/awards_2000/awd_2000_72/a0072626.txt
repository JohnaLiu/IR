Abstract.
This proposal is concerned with mappings of
              the plane which keep
certain subcontinua invariant. Historically the first 
              significant
results for maps of the plane were obtained for
              orientation
preserving  homeomorphisms. All homeomorphisms of the plane
              are
either orientation preserving or orientation reversing. In this
proposal
              we will introduce a new class of oriented mappings. Every
oriented map is
              either positively or negatively oriented. We
expect to show that all
              compositions of open and monotone (proper
and onto) mappings of the plane are
              oriented. We have generalized
known results on the existence of fixed points
              in non-separating
invariant plane continua for homeomorphisms of the plane to
              the
class of positively oriented maps. We expect this to be true for
all
              oriented maps. We will establish connections between these
problems and the
              structure of invariant continua of branched
covering maps of the plane
              including the structure of the boundary
of invariant simply connected domains.
              We will make use of prime
end techniques as well as results from continuum
              theory and
dynamical systems.
