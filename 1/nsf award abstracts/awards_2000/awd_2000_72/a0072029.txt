This three-year award, which supports U.S. Spain cooperative
              research in molecular biology, involves Maria Tasayco of the City University of
              New York's City College and Jose Sanchez-Ruiz of the University of Granada and
              Angeles Jimenez of the Center for the Structure of Materials in Madrid, Spain. 
              The objective of their research is to map out which regions from a family of
              complementary protein fragments are essential for their reassembly. 
              Specifically, they will change the interface surface between folded
              complementary fragments while maintaining the overall architecture to produce a
              flat or intertwined interface with the Thioredoxin (Trx) model system. They
              will clarify how the interface affects the stability and the rate constant of
              dissociation/unfolding of the artificially generated heterodimers derived from
              Trx. 

The U. S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in
              designing, engineering, and generating protein fragments and conducting kinetic
              studies of folding/binding processes between protein fragments.  This is
              complemented by the Spanish investigators' strengths in thermodynamic studies
              of protein folding and stability using calorimetry, and in NMR studies of
              proteins, protein fragments and their complexes.  The research will advance our
              understanding of protein interactions occurring within living organisms and to
              design ways to modulate the affinity and specificity in protein
              folding/binding.
