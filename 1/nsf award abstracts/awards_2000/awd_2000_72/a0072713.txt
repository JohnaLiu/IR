Abstract    :
              Arthropods constitute more than 75% of the terrestrial world's biodiversity and
              deserve increased attention in regions of the world, such as Madagascar, where
              species-rich habitats are under threat.  This project will provide data on
              patterns of species richness, turnover, and endemism of arthropods in
              Madagascar, one of the major conservation priorities and one of the least
              explored biogeographic regions for arthropods on earth. The proposed
              inventories are critical for efforts to understand the origin and evolution of
              the arthropods of Madagascar and are essential for developing conservation
              priorities on the island that preserve the most diversity, an effort seriously
              impeded by a lack of collections and trained biologists.  In collaboration with
              the Tsimbazaza Botanical and Zoological Park (PBZT) in Madagascar, the project
              has the following  primary goals: (1) conduct intensive inventories of
              terrestrial arthropods in 15 localities in western and southern Madagascar; (2)
              provide conservation agencies in Madagascar with baseline biodiversity data for
              sound conservation planning; (3) establish a digital database consisting of
              keys, check lists, catalogues, and specimen data on line; (4) assist in
              developing a national arthropod collection in Madagascar; (5) promote Malagasy
              understanding of entomology through training of parataxonmists and graduate
              students.
