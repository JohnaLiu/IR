The control of the molecular weight of macromolecules is
              important in pharmaceutical applications, biotechnology, and polymer
              processing.  The PIs plan to use DNA molecules with cohesive ends ("sticky
              ends") as a model system to study the physics of shear-induced polymerization. 
              Using mechanical rheometry, molecular "combing," shear-flow fluorescence
              microscopy, molecular sequencing, and gel electrophoresis, they plan to uncover
              and quantify the fundamental mechanism of shear-induced polymer assembly.

In
              particular, they will investigate:
1. the shear-rate dependence of
              polymer-length distribution,
2. the reversibility of shear-induced
              polymerization,
3. the influence of ion charge and concentration in solution,
              and
4. the effects of polymer length and of
5. polymer-end "stickiness" and
              temperature on shear-induced polymer assembly.
They plan to verify that the
              shear flow, which favors inter-chain interactions via connection of the
              cohesive ends of the polymers, induces the assembly.  These results will be
              used to study the behavior of associating polymers under shear and may form the
              basis of an approach to control polymer assembly in recombitant DNA technology
              and polymer science.
