The
              geometry group at the University of Texas proposes to carry
out a variety of
              research projects, most of which are related to
physics.  Dan Freed's current
              research focuses on questions in
geometry and topology arising from string
              theory.  These include
the construction of determinant line bundles on
              manifolds with
boundary and the understanding of anomalies of actions
              which
arise in quantizing lagrangian field theories.  Karen
              Uhlenbeck's
current research involves the geometric theory of
              integrable
systems, as well as a non-linear Schroedinger equation arising
              in
macroscopic theories of a ferro-magnetic continuum. These two
researchers
              are starting a project aimed at understanding the
appearance of integrable
              systems in conformal field theories.
Bob Williams is applying his expertise on
              attractors to the
construction of tiling spaces.  Constantin Teleman is
              pursuing
several projects in the cohomology of infinite dimensional
              Lie
Algebras. He and his coworkers are making progress on the
MacDonald
              conjectures, and are also giving geometric
interpretations in terms of the
              Hodge cohomology of flag
varieties of loop groups.  He is also interested in
              homotopy
equivalences between holomorphic and continuous mapping
spaces.
              Postdoctoral members of the group are Nurit Krausz, who
is working on direct
              computations for quantum field theory in
Minkowski space, and Adrian Vajiac
              who uses equivariant
localization techniques to study topological quantum
              field
theories.

At this point in time, geometry is a rapidly developing
              area of
mathematics.  While research in geometry, like most of
              pure
mathematics, consists of the construction and development of
abstract
              concepts, the origins and ultimate applications for
these constructions are
              invariably examples and applications in
more applied fields. The influence of
              theoretical physics on
geometry is strong.  For example, large numbers of
              geometers are
currently working on questions related to quantum groups,
              mirror
symmetry and quantum cohomology. Our group attempts not to work
on
              problems which have already been identified by mathematicians
as central, but
              in contrast we look at current ideas in physics
of all sorts and then find,
              clarify, and work on the
mathematically interesting questions more directly. 
              Dan Freed's
work on string theory connects the physics ideas of
              quantization
with the mathematical subject of algebraic topology.  His
              joint
project with Karen Uhlenbeck on the appearance of integrable
systems in
              certain quantum field theories requires an
understanding of field theory,
              integrable systems, and the very
important and basic ideas of symmetry. 
              Constantin Teleman's work
deeply involves fundamental ideas of symmetry, as
              well as delving
into the question of how closely very messy functions can
              be
approximated qualitatively by polynomial-like objects. Some of
the
              geometric ideas come from other branches of physics, such as
the
              ferro-magnetic equations studied by Uhlenbeck.  The tiling
spaces of William's
              come from beautiful examples such as those
constructed by Roger Penrose.  Our
              efforts bring new ideas and
techniques into mathematics, rather than
              concentrating on
projects which are already popular.
