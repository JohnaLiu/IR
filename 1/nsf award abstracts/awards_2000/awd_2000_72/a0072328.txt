Professor Wenxiong Chen will work on a series of nonlinear
problems in
              differential geometry. One of his main subjects is
prescribing Gaussian and
              scalar curvature: given a function on a
Riemannian manifold, can it be
              realized as the curvature of some
pointwise conformal metric? This is
              equivalent to solving certain
semi-linear elliptic partial differential
              equations.  He will
also work on uniformization theorems on singular surfaces
              and the
existence of harmonic maps between complete, noncompact
manifolds,
              which are closely related to the study of fourth order
nonlinear elliptic
              equations, nonlinear elliptic systems, and
nonlinear parabolic
              systems.

According to Einstein, the Universe we live in is a curved
              space,
in which gravity is realized as a distortion or bending of
space-time
              in the neighborhood of a massive object and this
change of shape is measured
              by the curvature tensor.  Chen's
research is focused on understanding when a
              given function can
become a curvature. This is a challenging problem in
              Riemannian
geometry and the analysis of partial differential equations,
              to
which many researchers have contributed.  The nonlinear
              partial
differential equations and systems studied in this project
              have
various applications in physics, chemistry, and biology, such as
in
              fluid dynamics, combustion theory, and river pollution
