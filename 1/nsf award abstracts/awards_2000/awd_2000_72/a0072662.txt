This project will address definition, interplay, and
              rigorous estimates of 
various natural small scales arising in a viscous
              incompressible flow. In 
particular, we will consider those lengths that can
              be derived directly from 
solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, which is
              the main model for a 
fluid flow. Examples of such scales are the those
              resulting from the 
Fourier spectrum of solutions, such as the inverse of the
              wave number at 
which the Fourier spectrum is cut off exponentially, and the
              length scales 
measuring complexity of level sets of solutions.  Related
              problems will be 
addressed also for other dissipative partial differential
              equations arising in 
fluid dynamics, such as the Ginzburg-Landau and the
              Kuramoto-
Sivashinsky equations.

Navier-Stokes equations are perhaps the
              most widely studied system of 
nonlinear partial differential equations. They
              are generally believed to 
contain necessary ingredients to explain much of
              turbulence phenomena. 
This project will address properties of solutions which
              would have 
implications in understanding creation and properties of fine
              structures in 
a flow.  Potential applications include quantifying complexity
              of a fluid 
flow, establishment of spectral properties of solutions,
              estimation of the 
size of the mesh needed to resolve a flow numerically, and
              information on 
locating observables for the flow's monitoring
