Abstract    :
              Females of many species are selective when choosing a mate, possibly in an
              attempt to obtain the best genes for their offspring. In support of this idea,
              recent studies have found that the offspring of more attractive fathers are
              generally in better condition. Although this appears to support the notion that
              attractiveness signals an inheritable paternal quality, another possibility
              exists. A growing body of theoretical and empirical evidence indicates that
              mothers may increase investment in reproduction when mated to an attractive
              male. Therefore, the offspring of an attractive male could be in better
              condition because its mother, responding to the attractiveness of her mate,
              provided extra investment. Using artificial insemination, this study
              experimentally separates paternal genetic effects from maternal investment
              effects to assess the relative roles of these two factors in determining
              offspring condition in red junglefowl.

	Many patterns of mate selection and
              attraction are found throughout the animal kingdom, and the study of animals is
              not complete without consideration of these important phenomena. In recent
              years, great strides have been made in understanding when and why animals are
              selective in their mate choice. This project seeks to add important components
              to this understanding by filling gaps in our knowledge of the benefits to
              females in being choosy.
