Problems in model selection, mixtures and weighted likelihood

We
              study problems in model selection, mixtures and weighted likelihood.  In
              particular, we first discuss extensions of the weighted likelihood methodology
              introduced by Markatou et al (1997,1998) in the context of regression models
              and its connection to model selection issues with emphasis in the mixture model
              context.  We then generalize these ideas to study general model selection
              problems.  The role of the disparity measures that are associated with weighted
              likelihood, and several others, is studied in detail in connection with
              goodness of fit approach to model selection.

The point of view we take here
              is that parametric models can provide informative, parsimonious descriptions of
              the data.  Then, the test statistics for testing the model adequacy are
              constructed and the asymptotic distributions under the null hypothesis and
              under contiguous alternatives are studied.  The theory here is based on
              empirical processes.  To practically implement the methods we propose to
              bootstrap the test statistics to obtain appropriate p-values.  We consider
              bootstrapping from a hybrid between the model distribution stipulated by the
              null hypothesis and the data and study the consistency of it.  When the model
              is false we prefer nonparametric bootstrap.  The performance of Bickel's m out
              of n bootstrap will be examined.
