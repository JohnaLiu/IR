The
              40,000-acre wildfire in Northern California that occurred 16 October 1999
              presents a very valuable scientific opportunity to address new questions about
              aquatic ecosystem and terrestrial plant community responses to perturbation. 
              Aquatic studies will examine (1) whether nutrient enrichment 'cascades up'
              alternating trophic levels (as sometimes found in simple experimental systems)
              or increases abundances at all trophic levels (as typically found in complex
              natural systems); (2) the speed of recovery of the simpler invertebrate faunas
              of intermittent streams in comparison to more complex faunas of permanent
              streams; and (3) whether nutrient enrichment leads to higher biological uptake
              of mercury in this system. Terrestrial studies will examine how spatial
              isolation from seed sources influences the recovery of the grassland plant
              community and whether the effects of fire on the plant community (including its
              dominance by alien species) depends on substrate and grazing history.  The
              results of this project coupled with a multi-year pre-fire database will
              provide new insights into how large infrequent fires influence patterns of
              diversity at the watershed scale.
