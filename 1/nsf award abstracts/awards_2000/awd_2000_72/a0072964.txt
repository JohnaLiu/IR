A
              converging/diverging nozzle, with an adequate ratio: "upstream stagnation
              pressure/receiver pressure", will deliver a fully expanded supersonic flow. 
              For pressure ratios above the value for a completely subsonic flow, but below
              the "adequate level" noted above, a subsonic flow will be delivered from the
              diverging passage.

The PI notes that a properly contoured diverging passage
              can provide a strongly unsteady flow and that this exiting flow can be used for
              the benefit of a number of applications.  The present bridging grant (one-year)
              is to permit the PI to better document the basis for this unsteady flow and to
              define, if appropriate, a focussed research effort to more thoroughly
              investigate it.
