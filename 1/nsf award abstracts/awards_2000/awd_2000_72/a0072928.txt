Abstract    :
              Jack Pladziewicz of the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire, is supported by the
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program for research in an
              undergraduate institution dealing with self-exchange electron-transfer rate
              constants and related reorganization energies. Particular attention will be
              devoted to: a) measurements to make possible comparison of self-exchange rate
              constants in the gas phase and in solvents (hydrazines in acetonitrile, etc.);
              b) couples with high redox potential; c) new systems of fundamental
              importance.

Electron-transfer reactions are of crucial significance in 
              chemical areas of great practical importance (industrial catalysis, biological
              respiration, neural functioning, for example). Although substantial progress
              has been made in recent decades in theoretical understanding of such processes,
              major unsolved problems remain. Further scientific  advance in this important
              area will depend on the availability of extensive data-sets based on careful
              measurements of judiciously selected systems. Measurement of such data provides
              an excellent introduction to scientific research for undergraduate students.
