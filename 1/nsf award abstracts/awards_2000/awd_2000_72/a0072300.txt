The aim of the present project is to study certain
              connections 
between mathematics and mathematical physics. The area of
              mathematics
concerned is Algebraic topology, which employs methods of
              algebra
to investigate properties of topological spaces (shapes) which remain
              
unchanged (invariant) under continuous deformation. Among such 
properties
              or invariants, a distinguished role is played by certain 
invariants of linear
              nature, known as generalized cohomology theories. 
The main goal of this
              project is studying interpretations and 
interactions of such cohomology
              theories with certain areas of physics, 
geometry and algebraic geometry
              (spaces of solutions of algebraic 
equations).

Concretely, the investigator
              focuses on two areas. The first object
is finding a geometric (or physical)
              model of elliptic cohomology.
It is conjectured that elliptic cohomology can
              be recovered by
infinite loop space theory from a category of
              holomorphic
conformal field theories. The other area concerns the study
              of
Morava K-theories in a homotopy category of algebraic varieties
introduced
              by Voevodsky.
