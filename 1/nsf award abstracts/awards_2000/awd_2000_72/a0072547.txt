Quantum cohomology is a deformation of usual cup
              product
of ordinary cohomology ring of a smooth projective variety X. 
              Similarly quantum K-theory is a deformation of ordinary 
K-ring of X.   In
              their study of Gromov--Witten K-theory, 
Professor Lee and his collaborators
              have found some interesting relations to other fields in mathematics and
              physics including algebraic geometry, integrable systems, representation theory
              
and quantum geometry.  These investigations also naturally lead 
to further
              investigations of Gromov--Witten theory itself.  The 
main focus of this
              project will be on quantum cohomology, quantum K-theory and their relations to
              discrete KdV hierarchies, Toda lattices, and enumerative geometry.
              

Gromov-Witten theory is a new subject that lies within the
intersection of
              many traditional branches of mathematics and 
theoretical physics.  This
              theory was originally discovered 
within string theory.  Shortly thereafter
              people found many new applications to mathematics.  Some of these applications
              solved
problems that, based on traditional methods, were considered to
be
              very difficult.  The tools used to study Gromov--Witten theory 
also involves
              many fields, including algebraic geometry, topology 
and analysis.  Thus, this
              is a growing new field which exhibits 
many rich structures and deserves
              further investigation
