Abstract    :
              James Lisy of the University of Illinois; Urbana-Champaign is supported by a
              grant from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to continue his studies
              of non-covalent interactions of chemical and biochemical importance.  These
              studies are on mass selected cluster ions produced in an upgraded thermionic
              source and a recently constructed electrospray source, using infrared
              photodissociation and collision induced dissociation (CID).  Particular systems
              to be studied are: (1) hydrated complexes of alkali cations with crown ethers
              and peptides to establish whether the ion is ligated by the solvent or the
              peptide/ionophore; (2) cation-ligand systems such as phenol, where the ligand
              has two binding sites, to establish where binding preferentially occurs and (3)
              anion (Cl- and Br-) with model receptors such as perfluorobenzene and amines to
              determine relative bond strengths.

The studies will lead to a greater
              understanding of the bonding between ions and solvent molecules.  This will
              improve our knowledge at the fundamental molecular level and show how the
              solvation, in situations including those where there are multiple binding
              sites, can be either cooperative or competitive.  The information obtained will
              have relevance to the condensed phase and, in particular, to biological systems
              where the solvent molecules sometimes have to be removed before a molecule can
              pass through a cell membrane.
