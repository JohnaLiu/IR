	This grant supports the involvement of the PI and
              undergraduate students in a program of research in experimental nuclear
              physics.  The proposed experiments include measurements of nuclear properties,
              including lifetimes and decay branching ratios, that are important for
              understanding the synthesis of elements heavier than oxygen in explosive
              stellar environments, as well as
investigations of the effect on nuclear
              reaction dynamics of the
exotic structure of the nucleus helium-6, a "neutron
              skin"
nucleus.  Experiments will be carried out at the University of
Notre
              Dame, using the FN Tandem Van de Graaff accelerator and
TwinSol radioactive
              beam facility, and at the CYCLONE radioactive
beam facility in
              Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.  In addition to
contributing to an improved
              understanding of nucleosynthesis and
of the reactions dynamics of neutron-skin
              nuclei, this project
will provide an opportunity for undergraduate students at
              Indiana
University South Bend to become actively involved in exciting
              and
important research.  Support is also provided in this grant for
these
              undergraduates to attend regional scientific meetings, where
they will present
              their results.
