The
              long term goal of this project is to study holomorphic
mappings and real
              submanifolds arising in the field of several
complex variables. One topic of
              proposed research is on the
existence of periodic points of reversible and
              symplectic
holomorphic mappings near an elliptic fixed point of general
              type
and on the integrability property of holomorphic symplectic
mappings via
              meromorphic eigenfunctions. Another topic is on the
topological and analytic
              structure of singular Levi-flat real
hypersurfaces in connections with
              singular complex
hypersurfaces. Other topics include the structure
              of
non-reversible conformal mappings and their connections with
              the
non-reversibility of real analytic Hamiltonian systems.

The
              differential equations dealing with the motion of N
masspoints (a model of the
              solar system) in the three-dimensional
space attracting each other according
              to Newton's law form a
Hamiltonian system. The periodic orbits of
              certain
area-preserving mappings corresponds to the periodic motion in
the
              Hamiltonian system of the restricted three body problem, and
the study of the
              existence of such periodic orbits goes back at
least to the work of Poincare
              and Birkhoff about a century
ago. Holomorphic symplectic mappings are natural
              extensions of
area-preserving ones. Such an extension might allow one to
              apply
methods in complex variables to the study of real Hamiltonian
systems.
              Indeed, recent work on the existence of non-reversible
area-preserving
              mappings depends on some deep knowledge of
conformal mappings studied
              extensively in complex analysis.
