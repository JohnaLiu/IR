Abstract    :
              
The Gordon Research Conferences on a number of scientific topics, are held
              every summer to discuss recent findings and current thinking in various areas
              of science.
Although participation is limited, the attendees usually consist
              of established scientists, young investigators who are making important
              contributions in these areas, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students.  The
              meetings are usually held in small isolated New England towns away from other
              distractions, and are conducive to the free exchange of ideas.  Recently some
              conferences have also been held in Europe.  These conferences have a recognized
              value for presenting the latest advances in research and also for indicating
              the future trends in research which are likely to be most productive.
