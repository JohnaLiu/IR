ABSTRACT

This project studies
              the topology of 4-dimensional manifolds. The
most prominent problems are the
              characterization of good
fundamental groups for the 4-dimensional s-cobordism
              theorem, the
formulation of a 4-dimensional (homology) surgery theory, and
              the
understanding of the topological knot concordance group.  The
existing
              techniques from nilpotent/solvable group theory and higher
order intersection
              numbers of 2-spheres and Whitney towers in
4-manifolds are to be combined with
              methods from L2-homology and
von Neumann algebras.

One of the most exciting
              mathematical discoveries in the last
decades is the fact that Euclidean space
              behaves very differently
depending on whether the dimension equals or doesn't
              equal four
(which is the dimension we live in, allowing time as the
              fourth
dimension). More precisely, there is a unique way to do calculus
              in
Euclidean n-space except for n=4  where there are uncountably many such
              theories. These are the "exotic" structures on Euclidean 4-space, discovered by
              Donaldson, Freedman and others around 1983. This project deals with similar
              questions on more complicated 4-dimensional manifolds. For example, these
              may
have nontrivial fundamental group, so they are possibly more
similar to
              our universe than Euclidean 4-space. In this case the
fundamental questions
              are still wide open and there seems to be a
deep relation to the "continuous
              dimension" introduced by von
Neumann in his work on quantum mechanics.
