In this project, the principal investigator
              proposes to 
study the interactions between the symmetries of a complete
              
manifold and the behaviors of various analytical objects 
on it. More
              specifically, he proposes to link the structure 
and the size of the covering
              group with the polynomial 
growth harmonic functions and the spectral data on
              the 
covering space.  The main objectives of this project include 
deriving
              topological information about a (noncompact) 
manifold via analytical
              approaches and furthering the 
understanding of how the symmetries of the
              space affect 
the behavior of solutions to various geometric differential
              
equations, which is one of the main themes of the geometric 
analysis.
              

This project is intended to study how the behavior of 
the solutions to
              differential equations is related to the 
global structure and shape of the
              underlying space with 
partial symmetries. It is expected to both enhance our
              
understanding of the geometric-analytic structure and have
direct
              implications to various fields including possible 
applications in industry.
