Recent  results in 4-dimensional topology have
              shown that 
symplectic 4-dimensional manifolds can be characterized
              
topologically by the property of admitting a Lefschetz fibration.  
This
              proposal concerns constructions of Lefschetz fibrations, 
and in particular
              focuses on constructions involving branched coverings. We propose to develop
              and investigate applications 
for a procedure that compares the Lefschetz
              fibrations 
obtained as branched covers of deformations and resolutions 
of
              singular branch loci.

A 4-dimensional manifold is an object that on a small
              scale 
looks like Euclidean 4-dimensional space (such as our physical 
world,
              with time included). A fundamental open problem in 
mathematics is to classify
              the large scale shapes of 
4-dimensional manifolds.  A particular variety of
              4-dimensional manifold, originally appearing in classical physics 
but now a
              central object in pure mathematics, is known 
as a symplectic manifold. Recent
              techniques for studying 
symplectic 4-dimensional manifolds involve viewing
              them 
as Lefschetz fibrations, that is by particular sorts of 
cross-sections
              by 2-dimensional surfaces. This project 
seeks to generalize previous work of
              the applicant involving constructions of Lefschetz fibrations on symplectic
              
4-dimensional manifolds.
