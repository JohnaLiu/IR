Holomorphic bundles arise naturally in many
              different 
areas of geometry -  indeed they lie at the intersection 
of
              algebraic, symplectic, and complex differential geometry. 
At the center of
              this intersection are sets of partial 
differential equations, such as the
              so-called Hermitian-Einstein 
and Vortex equations, which place constraints on
              the 
geometric features of the bundles. Their solutions carry 
information
              not only about the geometry of the bundles 
on which they are defined, but
              also about their topological 
and algebraic structure. In recent year it has
              been discovered 
how by adding certain extra structure to a holomorphic
              
bundle, interesting new phenomena are revealed and important
applications
              can result.  The primary goals of this proposal
include a fuller understanding
              of these `augmented bundles', 
the equations defined on them, their moduli
              spaces, and their
applications.

Holomorphic bundles fall within the class
              of geometric objects
known as fiber bundles.  In addition to their prominent
              place 
in modern geometry, fiber bundles play an important role within
modern
              theoretical physics, where the influence of geometry can
hardly be overstated.
              General relativity, electromagnetism and 
its extensions (known as gauge field
              theories), and string theory
could not be formulated without sophisticated
              geometric tools such
as vector and principal bundles.
