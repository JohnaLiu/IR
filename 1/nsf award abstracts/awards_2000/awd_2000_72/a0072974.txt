Abstract    :
              The PI proposes a study of the influence of above and belowground herbivores on
              their host plants.  Natural enemies may shape interactions between these
              herbivores and their hosts and this work will also investigate that aspect.  PI
              Hunt will study weed biological control systems with an assemblage of
              specialized herbivorous insects and their host plants and natural enemies.  In
              field experiments, root herbivores, leaf herbivores, or both will be released
              into caged plots of purple loosestrife dominated wetlands.  The response of the
              plant community will be tracked and the PI will add a third trophic level
              interaction by looking at the effect of generalist predators on the
              herbivores.
