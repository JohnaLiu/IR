Abstract    :
              Although prokaryotes are ubiquitous and immensely important in numerous
              biological processes, the diversity of naturally-occurring marine populations
              is poorly known.  The reasons for this include a general lack of recognizable
              morphological differences, difficulties in culturability required for standard
              identification, and questions about proper classification.  This project will
              survey marine planktonic prokaryotes in diverse ocean habitats, including Great
              Barrier Reef sediments, California kelp beds, marine suspended particles, and a
              coral reef in Australia.  All of the work will classify these microbes by means
              of 16S rRna gene sequences, where previous study has identified new major
              groups of archaea, phylum or class-level bacterial groups, and other
              prokaryotes.  New sequences will be compared against a large database of
              existing sequences representing major lineages of prokaryotes.
