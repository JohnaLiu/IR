Abstract    :
              The objective of this proposal is to investigate the mechanism of enhanced
              catalyst activity when electrical current is used to pretreat the catalyst.  In
              preliminary work the PI discovered that the activity of an indium/tin oxide
              catalyst for the selective oxidation of methanol to hydrogen is enhanced
              relative to thermal pretreatment when an electrical current is passed through
              the catalyst.  This reaction of is particular interest for portable fuel-cell
              applications, where hydrogen could be generated from methanol, which is more
              easily stored than hydrogen. The combination of electrical current and
              temperature required to maintain enhanced activation will be studied.  Catalyst
              particle size will be studied by using both nanoparticles and larger catalyst
              particles.  Effects of reaction local temperature gradients will be measured to
              determine whether local temperature on the particles is elevated.  Other
              organic reactions will be studied to determine whether this novel effect is
              more general.  If successful, this work could contribute to improved fuel-cell
              performance and more broadly to an understanding of an effect potentially
              useful for the improvement of catalyst activity.
