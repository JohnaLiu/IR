Abstract    :
                       This project is directed at understanding the role of ion-induced
              nucleation as a mechanism for new particle formation in the troposphere.  This
              effort involves the development of a unique microphysics code that simulates a
              size-resolved multicomponent aerosol system via a unified collisional mechanism
              involving both neutral and charged particles down to molecular sizes.  The
              model will be used to provide new analyses of existing field measurements,
              through case studies, sensitivity tests, and model/data intercomparisons. 
              These studies will involve the use of air mobility spectra, which are
              introduced in this context for the first time.  These data are useful for
              studying the initial stages of aerosol formation under tropospheric conditions.
              This work will elucidate the pathways to particle nucleation over a range of
              environmental conditions, and will identify mechanisms that are in accord with
              a variety of field measurements. We will use these results to formulate
              empirical relationships between nucleation rates and ambient conditions
              (precursor gas concentrations, background particle surface areas, local
              ionization rates, temperature, relative humidity, etc.).
