The University of Minnesota Duluth will operate the R/V
              Blue Heron during 2000 as a general oceanographic research vessel in support of
              NSF-supported research projects.  The Blue Heron is an 86 ft. vessel,
              constructed in 1985 and converted in 1997, and is owned by the Regents of the
              University of Minnesota and operated by Large Lakes Observatory.  The vessel is
              scheduled for a total of  96  operational days during 2000, of which 59 days
              are in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining cruises will
              support NOAA, State and other private projects.  The projects scheduled on the
              Blue Heron span a variety of oceanographic disciplines, such as biological,
              geological, chemical and physical oceanography, and will fully utilize the
              capabilities of the vessel.  Operations will take place on Lake
              Superior.

The Blue Heron is part of a fleet of ships used by the National
              Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most oceanographic
              projects require highly specialized equipment to be permanently installed on
              the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These vessels do not
              operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF
              supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to
              oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions
              around the country.
