Abstract    :
              This is a grant for support for a graduate student only. The
investigator works
              on two main topics - Hadwiger's conjecture, and
extensions of the graph minors
              project.

(a) Hadwiger's conjecture (proposed in 1943) states that any graph
              not
contractible to the n-node complete graph should be colourable with
              n-1
colours.  For small n it is true - eg for n = 5 and n = 6 it is
              
equivalent to the 4-colour theorem. For all larger n it is open.

(b) The
              graph minors project, by Neil Robertson and the investigator, 
was a major
              piece of work, spanning 23 long papers, which used graph 
structure theory to
              settle several open questions. One of the most 
difficult steps of this was
              proving that all graphs with large tree-width 
have large grid minors, and
              recently Diestel et al have found a short, 
simple proof of this vital fact.
              As a consequence, several conjectured 
extensions of the graph minors project
              now appear feasible.

This work is in graph theory. A graph is a network of
              nodes, some pairs
of which are joined by links - such as, for instance, a
              telephone
network, or a network of plane connections. To design fast
              algorithms on
graphs it is often important to make use of special properties
              of the
graph - for instance, perhaps it can be drawn without crossings,
              or
perhaps it can be built from very small graphs by piecing them together
              in
a tree-structure. Having such a useful, global structure is
              closely
related with with NOT containing certain substructures. The
              first
problem above asks whether the graphs with ANY given
              substructure
excluded are in some sense like those that can be drawn
              without
crossings. The second studies the theorem that all graphs
              not
containing a grid-like substructure can be expressed as a
              tree-structure
of small graphs.
