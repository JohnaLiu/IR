Abstract    :
              Non Abelian difference sets, Williamson-like Hadamard Matrices, integral Hecke
              algebras of diagram geometries and cyclotomic association schemes will be
              studied using and developing a representation theory of finitely based algebras
              over number rings.  Typical problems include explicit constructions for small
              parameter cases that are now open, computation of the arithmetic invariants
              (Smith normal form) of classical incidence maps, and enumeration of fusion
              schemes within a classical Hecke algebra.

By moving from fields to number
              rings this work builds a broader bridge between pure mathematics (number
              theory, abstract algebra) and combinatorial  constructions (finite geometry,
              algebraic combinatorics).  This work will lead to more penetrating mathematical
              tools to study known combinatorial  objects and the possibility to better
              design and build combinatorial  objects to meet specific "spectral"
              specifications.  These kinds of  ombinatorial constructions have had great
              value in cryptography and digital communication system design (e.g. high speed 
              modems and digital cellular telephony).  

This grant also supports guest
              speakers at a long running regional  Algebraic Combinatorics Seminar that
              includes and benefits faculty from   The University of Wyoming, The University
              of Colorado at Denver and Colorado State University
