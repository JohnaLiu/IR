The Bermuda Biological Station for Research, Inc. (BBSR)
              will operate the R/V Weatherbird II during 2000 as a general oceanographic
              research vessel in support of NSF-supported research projects.  The Weatherbird
              II is a 115 ft. vessel, constructed in 1982 and converted in 1993, and is owned
              and operated by BBSR.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 132 operational
              days during 2000, of which all days are in support of NSF-supported
              investigators. The projects scheduled on the vessel represent several
              oceanographic disciplines and will fully utilize the capabilities of the
              vessel.  The Weatherbird II continues to support such programs as the JGOFS
              sponsored BATS Program, the Hydrostation S time series, deep sediment trap work
              and atmospheric lead work.  Operations will take place around Bermuda, most
              approximately within 6 hour transit time.  New main engines, installed during
              shipyard visit in 1999, are operating satisfactorily.

The Weatherbird II is
              part of a fleet of ships used by the National Science Foundation in support of
              marine science research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly
              specialized equipment to be permanently installed on the vessel, thus the
              necessity for specialized ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same mode
              as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of a
              variety of ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are
              operated by universities and institutions around the country.
