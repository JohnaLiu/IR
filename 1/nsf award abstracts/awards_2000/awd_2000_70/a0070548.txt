Abstract    :
              This award, to Dr. Georges A. Guiochon and his group at the University of
              Tennessee-Knoxville, is supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              Program. The research conducts studies to better understand  nonideal,
              nonlinear chromatography.  The project concentrates on developing predictive
              models for preparative chromatography and confirming them by experimental
              studies.  The research builds upon and extends previous work by Dr. Guiochon
              and his group on fundamental properties such as thermodynamics and kinetics.
              Techniques that are improved as a result of  this project  include overloaded
              elution, gradient elution, and simulated moving bed separations.

This
              research emphasizes separation of pairs of enantiomers and protein mixtures.
              These types of separations are of critical importance in preparation of
              pharmaceuticals and certain food products.
