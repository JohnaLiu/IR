Abstract    :
              Cosmic rays have been observed up to energies in excess of 10^20 eV.  It is not
              at all clear how these particles are accelerated up to such energies, since
              standard acceleration scenarios have difficulties above about 10^15 eV or so. 
              It is clear, though, that the sources of these extremely high-energy cosmic
              rays must be nearby.  Otherwise interactions with the microwave background will
              degrade the particle energies, and thereby prevent them from getting to us from
              distant sources.  The Auger experiment is designed to study these highest
              energy particles.  Auger would be the first air shower array large enough (9000
              km^2-sr) to detect a reasonable number of 10^20 eV events, and it may have
              sufficient angular resolution to trace them back to their sources in the sky. 
              This proposal will aid in the Auger project development through simulations,
              prototype installation and necessary activities leading to formation of the
              international collaboration.
