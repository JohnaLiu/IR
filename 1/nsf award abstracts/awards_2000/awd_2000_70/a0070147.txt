Abstract    :
              MICRO-MECHANICS  ASSOCIATED  WITH  FRACTURE  IN  INTEGRATED 
              MICROELECTRONICS


The research addresses two contemporary micro-mechanics
              issues concerning fracture in microelectronic devices. One is the mechanics of
              dielectric fracture produced by electromigration in constrained interconnect
              structures. The other is how stresses accumulate in packaged devices,
              particularly under thermal cycling conditions, with particular emphasis on
              conditions of mechanical "shakedown" and "ratcheting" (a condition favoring
              cracking). The principal experimental tool used in the proposed research will
              be optical piezospectroscopy, using Raman spectroscopy and photostimulated
              luminescence. Piezospectroscopy is a developing, non-destructive and
              non-contact method of strain measurement with a spatial resolution of ~ 1micron
              when implemented using an optical microprobe.
