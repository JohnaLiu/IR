Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for the Berkeley Particle Data Center.  This
              center is a valuable resource for particle physicists, educators and students. 
              It is the headquarters of the international Particle Data Group whose primary
              task is to provide particle physicists with up-to-date compiled and evaluated
              particle-properties data, reviews and other information they most frequently
              need.  This information is made available to about 28,000 researchers, teachers
              and students thru the biennial publication of the "Review of Particle Physics"
              and the "Particle Physics Booklet" and through the annual publication on the
              World Wide Web.  The Center an its collaborators also produce the compilations
              "Current Experiments in Particle Physics" and "Guide to Experimental Particle
              Physics Literature".  The Center provides World Wide Web access to the
              information in its publications and databases.
