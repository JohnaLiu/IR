Abstract    :
              	The primary objective of the proposed research is to measure crack bridging
              fiber stress profile directly in a transparent fiber reinforced ceramic matrix
              composite (FRCMC) using a new technique of Debond Length Measurement (DLM) in
              conjunction with the optical fluorescence spectroscopy as a fingerprint for
              local state of stress. This objective is being accomplished by fabricating
              transparent and hybrid FRCMCs comprising of a glass matrix reinforced with
              reinforcing continuous SiC fibers and sensor sapphire fibers, performing in
              situ crack propagation studies using an optical microscopy, measuring crack
              bridging fiber stresses in situ using a new approach of DLM and fluorescence
              spectroscopy, and incorporating these results into analytical models to
              describe fracture resistance behavior of FRCMCs.
