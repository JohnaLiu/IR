Abstract    :
              Research is proposed covering a broad range of activities in theoretical atomic,
              molecular and optical physics at JILA.  The primary focus of is the study of
              ultracold gases, including the production and manipulation of Bose condensates
              (BEC), the creation of quantum vortices in a BEC, the study of multicomponent
              BEC's and atomic recombination at ultracold temperatures.  There are strong
              interactions between this group and the corresponding experimental groups at
              JILA and the University of Colorado
