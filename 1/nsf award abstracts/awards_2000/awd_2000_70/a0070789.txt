This U.S.-Romania research project between James Vary of
              Iowa State University and Sabin Stoica of the Romanian National Institute for
              Physics and Nuclear Engineering will work toward development of a precise
              theoretical framework for weak interaction processes in nuclei by combining the
              theory of effective operators with advanced many-body techniques. The goal is
              to improve shell-model (Sh.M) and quasiparticle random phase approximation
              (QRPA) calculations and apply them to studies of weak interactions occurring in
              the nuclei, including double-beta decay, conventional beta decay, and hadronic
              parity-violation.  To do this the U.S.-Romanian team will employ both
              proton-neutron QRPA and Sh.M methods with realistic, microscopic, effective
              Hamiltonians and then analyze the resulting nuclear matrix elements (NME). 
              Results are expected to improve our understanding of nuclear structure and
              benefit fundamental research related to astrophysics and cosmology.

This
              research in theoretical physics fulfills the program objective of advancing
              scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central
              Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas
              of strong mutual interest and competence.
