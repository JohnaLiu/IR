Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

It is proposed to use microlocal techniques (including Fourier
              integral
operators with complex phase) to study the following topics in
              global
analysis:  (A) The Toda PDE, a large N limit of the Toda lattice,
              in
the periodic and non-periodic cases.  Topics to be researched
              include
large N estimates relating Toda lattice solutions and solutions to
              the
Toda PDE, and shock formation.  (B) Spectral problems for the
Laplacian,
              including the semi-classical asymptotics of the scattering
matrix in manifolds
              with cylindrical ends.  (C) Symplectic geometry,
via generalized Szego
              kernels.  Specifically, the asymptotics of
Kodaira-type embeddings and the
              relationship between symplectic
capacities and geometric quantization will be
              researched.


The quantum-classical correspondence is a deep feature of
              Nature,
admitting a variety of mathematical manifestations.  In general
              terms,
these manifestations take the form of relationships between
              dynamical
systems (systems of ordinary differential equations) and
              partial
differential equations, in suitable asymptotic regimes
              (the
semi-classical limit).  The proposed research will investigate some
such
              relationships, in the general areas of completely-integrable
dynamical
              systems, the geometry of the Laplace operator, and
differential geometry.  A
              particularly novel aspect of the proposed
research is to the Toda PDE, a large
              N limit of the Toda lattice.  The
proposed research will result in a deeper
              understanding of certain
non-linear partial differential equations, and of the
              geometry of phase
spaces (symplectic manifolds).
