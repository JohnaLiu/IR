Abstract    :
              The proposed research focuses on the bound state properties and transition rates
              of isolated atomic systems and atoms in electromagnetic fields.  Some of the
              topics to be explored include improved approximations to wavefunctions of an
              atom in a laser field, calculating transition rates for atomic scattering in
              the presence of a laser field, threshold effects for long-range potentials and
              Casimir forces.
