	The goal of this research program is to unravel specific
              hallmarks of quantum phenomena of  model systems that are chaotic or have
              unpredictable behavior in the classical limit.  Progress has been made in
              understanding this problem, mostly for single particle systems. We propose to
              consider the many-body billiard problem in terms of an interacting  gas of
              electrons subjected to time-periodic magnetic fields.  Our initial results
              indicate that for a noninteracting electron gas the Pauli exclusion  ``force"
              significantly  modifies its magnetic properties depending if the dynamics is
              integrable or chaotic. We will next make this problem more realistic and
              include the Coulomb interactions, both classically and quantum mechanically. 
              We will also study billiards with broken rotational invariance that
              have
``fractional'' angular momentum with or without constant external
              magnetic fields.  The PI also proposes to study single particle chaotic 
              scattering in time-dependent multiple  potential billiards.  We will also 
              explore the connections between friction and  chaos,  in the context of simple
              time-dependent classical and quantum models. This is an important problem since
              it addresses the basic physical and  conceptual question of energy dissipation,
              classical chaos, and decoherence, of importance in the field of quantum
              computation.
