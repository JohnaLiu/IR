Abstract    :
              A compact infrared tunable room-temperature optically-pumped semiconductor laser
              source using epitaxially-grown transition metal-doped II-VI materials is
              proposed.  Chromium-doped II-VI lasers have already been demonstrated using
              ZnS, ZnSe, CdTe, CdMnTe, and CdSe with other semiconductor hosts under
              investigation.  Current Cr2+ lasers are relatively simple structures, presently
              Cr-doped bulk crystals, that operate at room temperature and are tunable over a
              large wavelength range (~ 2.1mm-2.8mm) with relatively temperature-insensitive
              operating characteristics. To achieve better performance, we propose the use of
              epitaxial II-VI heterostructures that will be composed of alloys of Zn1-xMgxSe
              and Zn1-xCdxSe grown by MBE, rather than homostructures.  The II-VI waveguide
              laser structure with Cr-doped active layer will be grown on a GaAs substrate. 
              Such heterostructures will confine the radiation emitted by Cr2+ to the active
              region, increasing the optical confinement factor.  The waveguide structure may
              also be used to increase the optical overlap of the pump source and the
              optically-active Cr2+.  These heterostructures will have a greatly reduced
              lasing threshold and increased overall efficiency as compared to the
              homostructures.  The epitaxial structures will be characterized via
              photoluminescence and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.  An
              optically-pumped Cr-doped heterostructure laser will be demonstrated using a
              commercially-available semiconductor laser pump.
