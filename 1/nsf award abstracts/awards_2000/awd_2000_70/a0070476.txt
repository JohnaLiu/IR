Abstract    :
                 The investigator will try to generalize the well-known Kronecker's
first
              limit formula to `holomorphic' Eisenstein series with characters
and study the
              tangent line of the Eisenstein series. He will then apply
the results to study
              the central derivative of automorphic L-functions.
In the second project, He,
              Kudla, and Rapoport will continue Kudla's 
fundamental work on the the central
              derivative of incoherent Eisenstein 
series. In particular, they will prove
              that the central derivative of
certain incoherent Eisenstein series is the
              generating function of zero
cycles on an arithmetic Shimura surface. He is
              also working with M. Stoll
on the arithmetic nature of a very nice genus two
              curve in relation with
the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. Finally, he
              is studying the
exterior cube automorphic L-series of GU(3, 3) in relation
              with the 
associated Shimura variety. 
  Number theory has been one of the
              most amazing subjects to study for 
more than two thousand years and will
              continue to be so. Even more so 
is its surprising and beautiful applications
              to communications and
cryptography discovered during last 20 years.
              Automorphic forms and 
Eisenstein series the investigator is working on is at
              the heart of
the modern number theory. Its advances would not only further
              our
understanding of the deep and beautiful subject of number theory but
              
also find its way to improve our daily life in the e-world.
