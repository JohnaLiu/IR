	This three-year research project will continue the
              investigations of the PIs on the area of Quantum Field Theories in the presence
              of external magnetic fields, helping them to widen their international
              
scientific collaboration, and maintaining their commitment to undergraduate
              research.
	Quantum Field Theories in the presence of external fields has long
              been a topic of intensive study in theoretical physics with applications to
              condensed matter physics, astrophysics and cosmology.  In the present project,
              the PI's will use non-perturbative techniques to study the influence of
              external magnetic fields on various physical situations: (1) the generation of
              the baryon asymmetry (the fact that there are more particles than antiparticles
              in the universe) within the so called Standard Model of Elementary Particles,
              (2) the behavior of the thermal conductivity in high -T superconductors as a
              function of the applied magnetic field, and (3) the propagation of neutrinos in
              neutron stars and 
during the early universe evolution.
