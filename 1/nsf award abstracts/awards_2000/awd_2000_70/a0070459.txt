              ABSTRACT

DMS-0070459

The proposed research involves the study of operators
              and their invariant
subspaces, and some problems arising in the theory of free
              random variables.  
The problems on invariant subspaces will focus on the
              structure and
classification results which can in special cases be inferred
              from the combinatorics of
Young tableaux.  Problems in free probability will
              concern the weak laws
for arbitrary arrays, and the study of multiplicative
              stability.  The
finer harmonic analysis of free convolutions will also be
              studied.

The work proposed here is mostly of a theoretical nature, and it
              is
intended to clarify some (sometimes unexpected) connections between objects
              studied
in different areas (such as operator theory, complex analysis,
              and
combinatorial analysis).  This kind of work does often have
              connections
with more applied areas.  The one specific applied area closely
              related to the operator theory
is control theory and optimization where
              operators have indeed found rather striking
applications.
