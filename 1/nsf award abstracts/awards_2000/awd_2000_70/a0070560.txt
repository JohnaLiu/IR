Abstract    :
              The principal investigator and his colleagues study non-commutative
algebraic
              goemetry with particular emphasis on projective
surfaces. General abstract
              methods are developed and are applied to
specific important classes such as
              quantum ruled surfaces, and blowups of
non-commutative analogues of the
              projective plane. The positive cone of
curves on these surfaces is studied,
              with the goal of better
understanding the intersection theory and using the
              Picard group as an
invariant. The possibility of using cyclic homology as a
              new invariant is
also under examination.

	Non-commutative algebraic
              geometry extends the fruitful
interaction of algebra and geometry that lies at
              the root of modern
algebraic geometry. The modern origin dates from Descarte's
              introduction
of coordinate axes, but until recently the geometric perspective
              on
algebra has been restricted to commutative algebra. However,
              modern
physics shows that nature behaves non-commutatively at the quantum
              level
(Heisenberg's uncertainty priciple says that the measurement
of
              momentum and position do not commute -that is, the order in which one
measures
              them affects the values obtained). Other fundamental mathematical
tools that
              appear in physics,like Lie groups and differential operators,
are also
              non-commutative. Thus, development of non-commutative geometry is
part of
              understanding the geometry underlying the mathematical structures
of modern
              physics.
