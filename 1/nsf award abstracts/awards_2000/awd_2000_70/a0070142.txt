This six-month award will provide support for Douglas
              Glazier of Juniata College and an undergraduate student to plan a cooperative
              research project with Dr. Alberto Basset and his students at the University of
              Bologna, Italy.  The objective of the project is to examine the ecological,
              bioenergetic, and life-history consequences of invasion of land and freshwater
              by marine isopod crustaceans; the Italian site provides several common species
              of marine, freshwater and terrestrial isopods.  At the planning stage, Drs.
              Glazier and Basset will prepare for future field and laboratory experiments and
              observations that will test several hypotheses concerning potential
              physiological, bioenergetic and ecological causes of the life-history
              differences observed, and their population consequences.  The long-term goal of
              the collaboration is to demonstrate that isopods are excellent model systems
              for studying the "macroevolutionary ecology" of major habitat shifts, and to
              increase understanding
