Parshall

This award will partially support a conference to be held
              at the University of Virginia, May 21-25, 2000.  The conference will focus on
              the interaction between infinite dimensional Lie theory in mathematics and
              conformal field theory in physics.  There has been considerable activity in
              this area in the past two decades that has been enriching for both sciences. 
              The conference will be structured around three mini-courses delivered by three
              international leaders in their respective areas, and complemented by additional
              one hour talks.  This is an important area, and the conference will allow many
              graduate students and young investigators to gain first hand knowledge from the
              areas' leaders.
