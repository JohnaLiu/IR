Abstract    :
              With the advent of third and fourth generation wireless infrastructure, and the
              simultaneous emergence of pervasive connectivity for all devices based on
              bluetooth like systems and ad-hoc networks, a new vista is open for research in
              the area.  We propose ideas for a research program aimed at realizing
              ubiquitous computing systems) which are located in vicinity of one another. 
              These systems will be composed of a collection of independently designed
              components that automatically become aware of each other, establish basic
              (wireless) communication, exchange information about their capabilities and
              requirements, discover and exchange APIs, and learn to cooperate effectively to
              accomplish their individual and collective goals.  The proposed work will
              enable a new class of applications that effectively use mobility and pervasive
              computing.  We address several research problems that span the fields of
              distributed computing, data management, and dynamic collaboration between
              components.  The team of researchers is located at UMBC and UI-Chicago, and
              plans to interact closely with collaborators at industrial labs (IBM, Hughs,
              Sun).
