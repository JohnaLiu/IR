Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT:

The investigator wants to study two topics in Several Complex
              Variables.
The first is on holomorphic embeddings. By constructing holomorphic
              functions,one seeks to embed complex manifolds as closed submanifolds of some
              complex Euclidean space of as low dimension as possible.
The second is on
              envelopes of holomorphy.
In constructions of holomorphic functions, one is
              faced with the
restriction that sometimes they all extend past certain
              boundary points,
for example, in higher dimensions no holomorphic function can
              have an
isolated singularity. Isolated boundary points belong to the envelope
              of
holomorphy.The investigator will study, more generally, envelopes
              of
holomorphy. In particular, there is a great need for investigation of
              a
large variety of examples.

Complex analysis is a basic tool in many
              fields of mathematics and in other sciences. Even problems described with real
              numbers are often dealt with more naturally after extending into the
complex
              domain. A foundational problem of the subject is how to construct
              holomorphic
functions with required properties. This basic problem has
              motivated much
of the work of the proposer in the past and is also the
              motivation for
this proposal. For example how can one find a holomorphic
              function tending
to infinity at a certain boundary point, or has some other
              singularity
there?
