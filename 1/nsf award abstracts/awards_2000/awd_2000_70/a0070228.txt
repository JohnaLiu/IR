Abstract    :
              
A continuous-wave mode-locked semiconductor laser, widely tunable in the
              terahertz frequency range, and with power and spectral density sufficient for
              applications, will be developed, based on the p-Ge active medium working on
              intra-valence-band transitions of hot holes.  Continuous wave operation, which
              is inaccessible for traditional hot-hole pGe lasers, will be achieved in the
              mode-locked regime using a new traveling wave excitation scheme and an open
              cavity design in combination with gain optimization by uniaxial stress. 
              Traveling wave excitation will decrease the intrinsic heating of the active
              medium by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude.  Application of uniaxial stress will
              increase the gain by splitting the light-and heavy-hole subbands.  The laser
              will generate a continuous train of ~ 10 ps pulses of THz radiation with ~1 GHz
              repetition rate.  This continuous wave mode-locked operation will make this
              laser attractive for applications that include far-infrared molecular and
              solid-state spectroscopy, TRz radioastronomy, and satellite/near-earth THz
              communications.  The knowledge gained will suggest future thin-flim/epi-layer
              schemes for THz lasers based on p-Ge population inversion mechanisms.  Graduate
              and undergraduate research assistants will gain experience in semiconductor
              physics and processing, THz technology, laser principles, spectroscopic
              techniques, and rf/microwave electronics.
