              ABSTRACT

A major goal of this proposal is to understand the role of fixed
              and
free boundaries in rigorous nonlinear geometric optics.  The
              central
importance of boundaries is indicated, for example, by the fact
              that
multidimensional shock and vortex sheet problems can be formulated
              as
nonlinear hyperbolic free boundary problems.  The author proposes
              to
continue his work on geometric optics for quasilinear boundary
              problems
and multidimensional strong shocks, and to extend it to weak shocks;
              to
study the evolution of boundary layers in quasilinear fixed and
              free
boundary problems, especially the role of glancing boundary layers in
              a
new mechanism for shock instability; to construct Rayleigh waves
              in
nonlinear elasticity as propagating elliptic boundary layers and
              to
investigate their nonlinear (resonant) interactions with other
              waves.


The construction of formal, asymptotic solutions to nonlinear
              PDEs
(nonlinear geometric optics) has long been an important tool of
              applied
mathematics.  Formal solutions  yield qualititive information about
              many
complex wave phenomena  such as resonance, shocks, Mach stems, and
              vortex
sheets, and can be used to predict and explain the results of physical
              or
numerical experiments.  An important task for pure mathematicians is
              to
rigorously justify such expansions, that is, to show that they are
              close
to genuine exact solutions.  Rigorous analysis also leads to the
              discovery
of unexpected phenomena, such as new blow-up mechanisms, for
              example.
