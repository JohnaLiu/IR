Project Abstract:

The project addresses the need for
              non-contact temperature monitoring and mapping techniques during Rapid Thermal
              Processing (RTP) of silicon wafers that have improved accuracy, sensitivity and
              range as compared to conventional pyrometric methods.  The computational and
              experimental work already in place provides the foundation for development of a
              physical system which uses Thermal-Acousto-Photonic Non-Destructive Evaluation
              (TAP-NDE) to generate and detect thermally-dependent, ultrasonic, guided (Lamb)
              waves.  These interrogate the silicon wafer and provide information about the
              thermal state of the wafer.  This study is expected to establish the necessary
              knowledge base for a better understanding of: surface layer effects;
              high-temperature dissipative mechanisms; extraction of thermal information in
              real-time; optimization of thermoelastic generation and optical sensing
              techniques in severe temperature environments; and adaptation and integration
              of the method into an algorithm implementable into dedicated Digital Signal
              Processor (DSP) hardware.  Development of the technique has far-reaching impact
              in other fields as well.  For example, high-resolution thermal measurement at
              high temperatures is needed in manufacturing of high-performance jet engine
              turbine blades, determination of residual stresses induced by localized high
              thermal gradient heating, and nano-technology based deposition of thin
              films/layers in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS).
