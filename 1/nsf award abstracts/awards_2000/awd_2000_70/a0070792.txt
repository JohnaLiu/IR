Investigation of a new class of
              solutions to certain physically significant multidimensional nonlinear wave
              equations and associated linear scattering problems will continue.  This work
              follows the discovery by the principal investigator that these solutions can be
              associated with an integer, referred to as the charge.  Solutions and
              properties of a class of nonlinear differential-difference equations which
              arise in the study of fiber optic arrays will be obtained by employing
              analytical, computational and approximation/asymptotic techniques.  Recent
              joint experimental-theoretical investigations of water waves by the principal
              investigator and collaborators has demonstrated that infinite dimensional
              chaotic dynamics can eventually result from the well known modulational
              instability of the classical Stokes water wave.  The underlying mechanism
              governing this phenomenon has recently been uncovered.  Further experiments and
              analysis are planned.  Preliminary analysis has indicated that this dynamical
              scenario can also be observed in fiber optics.

The dynamics of wave systems
              with large amplitude is often referred to as nonlinear wave motion.  In
              contrast to the substantial theory available to understand small amplitude
              phenomena, the mathematical description of nonlinear wave motion is still in an
              early stage of development.  Applications range from the study of large
              amplitude ocean waves to the propagation of pulses of light in fiber optics. 
              Extremely stable, localized nonlinear waves, called solitons, are closely
              related to the investigations in this project.  Solitons are being investigated
              worldwide due their potential use in high data rate communications over
              fiber-optic cables.  The mathematical discoveries made in the field of
              nonlinear waves only a few years ago are now at the cusp of commercial
