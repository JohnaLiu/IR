              ABSTRACT:
        This proposal deals with problems concerning the isomorphic
              structure
of classical Banach spaces and their quantized analogues, operator
              spaces.
The problems to be studied lie in the following four areas:
   I. The
              complementation problem for ideals in C* algebras.
  II. Certain extension
              properties for separable operator spaces.
 III. The structure of complemented
              subspaces of nuclear C*-algebras.
  IV. The structure of non-commutative
              L^p-spaces.
Specific problems include the following:
Area I:  Let J be an
              ideal (closed, 2-sided) in a C*-algebra A with A/J
separable. Is J Banach
              complemented in A?  An important special case is
where J = K, the ideal of
              compact operators on separable infinite-dimensional
Hilbert space; this is
              related to the uniform approximation property in
classical Banach space
              theory.
Area II: Does every separable operator space X with the CSCP
              completely
embed in K?  X is said to have the CSCP if it is locally reflexive
              and
completely complemented in every separable locally reflexive
              superspace.
Area III: Is every complemented subspace of a separable nuclear
              C*-algebra
completely isomorphic to a nuclear operator space?  Is the converse
              true?
Area IV: Let N be a von Neumann algebra and X be a subspace
              (infinite-
dimensional, linear, and closed) of the predual of N.  Does l^p
              embed in
X for some 1 < or = p < or = 2?  If M is another von Neumann algebra,
              and the
preduals of M and N are Banach isomorphic, do M and N have the same
              type?

        The study of operator spaces involves mathematics underlying
              the
foundation of quantum mechanics.  Important "quantized" Banach spaces
              include
C*-algebras such as the Fermion algebra and the algebra of compact
              operators
on Hilbert space, and the preduals of von Neumann algebras,
              i.e.,
non-commutative L^1-spaces.  The problems concerning the structure of
              these
spaces will be approached from the perspective of classical Banach
              space
theory.  This approach has already had considerable success, yielding
              basic
properties of the space of compact operators, and the Banach
              distinction
between the preduals of finite and infinite von Neumann
              algebras.
