Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a group at the University of Cincinnati to
              participate in two neutrino experiments at Fermilab:  NuTeV,where data taking
              was recently completed in the high energy neutrino line, and BooNe, the new
              booster neutrino experiment currently under construction.

NuTeV was designed
              to measure sin2qW and r, two essential parameters of the Standard Model of
              electroweak interactions, whereqW  is the weak mixing angle and r is related to
              the ratio of neutrino to anti-neutrino interactions.   This group developed a
              sign-selected quadrupole train to eliminate neutrinos from wrong-sign or
              neutral parents.  NuTeV exceeded its goal of recording 1.5 million neutrino
              interaction events.  During the period of this award, analysis of the data will
              continue and results will be published.

BooNe is a new experiment designed
              to study neutrino oscillations.  Recent results from the LSND experiment at Los
              Alamos suggested that nm 's could oscillate into ne's.  BooNe is designed to
              either confirm or refute this result at the ten standard deviation level, and
              at an energy ten times higher than at Los Alamos.  During the period of this
              award, design and construction of the experiment will be done.
