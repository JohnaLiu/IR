              Abstract


A detailed mathematical study will be undertaken of so-called
              "Sigma-Delta"
conversion schemes, which use simple and easily implementable
              algorithms to represent bandlimited functions by one-bit sequences; convolving
              such a one-bit sequence with an appropriately chosen filter leads to an
              approximation of the original bandlimited function. Different schemes,
              corresponding to different approximation orders, will be studied in detail; we
              expect the mathematical insights gained will lead to new variants that have
              better mathematical properties, and to generalizations to other settings than
              the 
approximation of bandlimited functions.

Analog-to-digital and
              digital-to-analog conversion, present in a wide range of 
applications, some
              familiar to all of us (e.g., CD players), others more confined to the field of
              scientific instrumentation, makes use of schemes that start by taking highly
              redundant information, and then replacing it by one-bit or few-bit sequences,
              from which the original information can be reconstituted with good precision.
              Because of the physical constraints in these conversions, the schemes used in
              practice have very interesting mathematical properties, quite different from
              the standard representation of numbers by a decimal or binary notation. It is
              proposed to study these properties in more detail, with the goal of proposing
              variants on the schemes, and to identify a wider range of applications for
              these conversion schemes.
