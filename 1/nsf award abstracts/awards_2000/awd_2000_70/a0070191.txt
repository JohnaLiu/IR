Abstract    :
              This projects aims at providing financial assistance for 12 leading American
              specialists in the mechanics and technology of brittle matrix composites for
              their participation at the next International Brittle Matrix Composites 6
              symposium in Poland, October 9-11, 2000.  The participation of a representative
              group of American scientists will considerably enhance the role of the
              Symposium BMC 6, and stimulate international cooperation.  It will also benefit
              the American research community in keeping a breast of European research and
              development in ceramic and cementitious composites, and their manufacturing and
              industrial applications.
