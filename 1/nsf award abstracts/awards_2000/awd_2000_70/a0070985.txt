The goals of this proposal are to: a) Obtain
              spectra (in the wavelength region of the 8000-Angstrom calcium triplet) of 10
              to 20 red giant stars in 11 Galactic clusters and determine (using stellar
              atmospheres ) the calibration of the CaII triplet as a metallicity
indicator.
              b) Obtain spectra of ~110 Red Giants in each of 3 regions in LMC and apply the
              calibration from the Galactic cluster giants to determine the LMC giant's
              metallicity and thus determine the star formation history in the LMC . The LMC
              observations will aid in understanding how local variations in star-formation
              history are distributed. This, in turn, will help us to understand
              star-formation in intermediate redshift galaxies.

One of the fundamental
              goals of modern astrophysics is to understand how galaxies have evolved. A
              galaxy's  evolution can be determined by measuring the chemical compositions
              and ages of its stars. In this project, Professor Smecker-Hane and
              collaborators will accomplish two goals. First, they will calibrate the depth
              of calcium absorption lines in the near-infrared spectra of stars as a function
              of age and chemical composition.  They will extend the current calibration to
              younger and more metal-rich stars so the calcium lines can be used to
              investigate other galaxies which have stars with ages from 2 to 15 billion
              years and chemical compositions from one to one-thousandth of the Sun. Second,
              these investigators will use this new calibration to determine the chemical
              composition of stars as a function of radius in the Large Magellanic Cloud
              (LMC) using Cerro Tololo InterAmerican 4 meter Telescope in Chile. The LMC is a
              gas-rich, intermediate-mass galaxy with a distance of only 160,000 light years,
              which makes it one of the Milky Way's nearest neighbors. They will combine the
              chemical compositions with data from the Hubble Space Telescope in order to
              accurately measure the LMC's star-formation history. Existing data hints that
              the LMC experienced a significant burst of star formation approximately 3 to 5
              billion years ago, and understanding the details of the burst -- its strength,
              duration, and cause - can give us valuable clues about the nature of star
              bursts frequently seen in faint blue galaxies at intermediate redshifts.
              Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for
              Extragalactic
Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).
