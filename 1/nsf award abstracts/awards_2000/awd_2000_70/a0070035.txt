Abstract    :
              The use of ultra ductile, strain-hardening Engineered Cementitious Composites
              (ECC), instead of brittle concrete, can overcome limitations in brittle shear
              and reinforcement buckling of standard R/C members. The advantage of combining
              ECC and reinforcement is that the deformation of the structural member can be
              distributed along its length, and therefore require less localized deformation
              of the longitudinal reinforcement.  The present research focuses on the
              enhancement of seismic response of R/C structures by exploiting the unusual
              behavior of ECC and its interaction with reinforcement. Novel design concepts
              are introduced. Specifically, detailed investigations and analyses will be
              performed on the interaction of candidate reinforcement materials and ECC.
              Subsequently, column and beam members will be designed and tested. Finally,
              R/ECC column and beam elements will be assembled into moment resisting frames
              and tested. The overall objective is to develop a structural frame system with
              superior seismic resistance with an intrinsic, materials-based safety
              mechanism.
