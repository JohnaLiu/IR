Abstract    :
              This GOALI award is to develop the fundamental understanding of an
              environmentally benign manufacturing process modification for metal casting.
              During metal casting, the molten metal solidifies within a mold and takes on a
              complex shape. Green sand molds include some coal and adhesives; and when these
              experience the high temperatures of molten metal, they can emit volatile
              organic compounds (VOCs).  A novel advanced oxidation (AO) process has been
              installed at five full-scale foundries, and has successfully decreased these
              emissions by 30-75%.  Moreover, this process has also diminished by 10-30% the
              amount of clay, coal, and sand required; and it has decreased casting defects
              by 10%.  The research objectives are to (a) better understand the fundamental
              engineering kinetics that underlie advanced oxidation processing; (b) at the
              bench and pilot scale, build on these fundamentals to yet further diminish
              emissions and enhance green sand performance with the AO process.  The
              potential impact and success of this research could be to advance the
              understanding of this AO process to where it will diminish total U. S. air
              pollution by 0.1 to 1% (relative to all air pollution sources).  At the same
              time, enhancement of these features will save money, prevent pollution, reduce
              waste to landfills, broaden foundries' opportunities, and create U. S. jobs in
              the vital foundry industry.   Tests will measure VOC emissions and green sand
              performance in a manner that facilitates enhanced behavior while also advancing
              basic process understanding and engineering understanding.  Bench scale tests
              will also mimic key features of the thermal exposure that foundry green sands
              experience, in order to acquire fundamental insight via well-controlled
              experiments.
