Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to develop general methods to study nonlinear, hyperbolic and
              parabolic/elliptic partial differential equations.  More precisely using
              techniques from analysis, partial differential equations and probability, the
              PI plans to continue his program working in the following four general areas: 
              
A.  Fully nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations of first-and
              second- order . 
B.  Phase Transitions. 
C.  Turbulent reaction-diffusion
              equations and combustion. 
D.  First- and second-order fully nonlinear,
              degenerate, elliptic and parabolic equations. 


Most of the partial
              differential equations considered in this proposal arise as models in continuum
              and statistical physics.  These models appear in a variety of topics ranging
              from material sciences and phase transitions (motion of fronts, mesoscopic and
              macroscopic scales, homogenization), in fluid flows (turbulent
              reaction-diffusion and combustion), and in stochastic analysis (interacting
              particle systems, flows in random environments and with random velocities, and
              stochastic control). The qualitative analysis of these models contributes to
              the better understanding of the actual physical problems, and provides, in many
              cases, the foundation for the development of efficient numerical algorithms.
