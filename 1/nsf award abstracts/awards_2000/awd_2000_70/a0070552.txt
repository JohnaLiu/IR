Abstract    :
              Novel experiments involving relative humidity-jumps (RH-jump) and carbon dioxide
              pressure-jumps (PCO2-jump) will be performed to investigate the structural
              recovery and physical aging responses of polymers subjected to rapid changes in
              plasticizing environment and chemical activity.  The effects of PH or
              PCO2-jumps will be compared quantitatively to those induced by
              temperature-jumps.  The comparisons will test the underlying hypothesis that
              changes in plasticizer content are quantitatively similar to changes in
              temperature for glass-changes in plasticizer content are quantitatively similar
              to changes in temperature for glass-forming systems.  The classic TNM-KAHR
              models of aging and structural recovery will be extended to include plasticizer
              effects and compared quantitatively with the experimental data.

Modern uses
              of plastics demand that they show dimensional stability and moisture resistance
              for both short and long time durations.  Electronic, automotive and
              infrastructure applications demand increasingly sophisticated data and model of
              the impact of plasticizing molecules such as water and carbon dioxide on the
              performance of polymers.  The proposed work may provide unique and fundamental
              data that tests the validity of models used to describe the mechanical and
              dimensional behavior of plastics in such environments.
