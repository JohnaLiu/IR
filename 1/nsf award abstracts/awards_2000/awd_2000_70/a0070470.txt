Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT

This award will provide funds to support a program of travel awards
              to logic students to assist them in attending the two main annual meetings of
              the Association for Symbolic Logic (ASL). These meetings are the ASL Annual
              Meeting, normally a four day meeting held during the Spring on a university
              campus in North America, and the ASL European Summer Meeting (Logic
              Colloquium), normally a week to ten day long meeting held during the Summer on
              a university campus in Europe. These two meetings are arguably the most
              important meetings in the field of logic. The ASL works to ensure that these
              meetings cover logic comprehensively and that they represent the highest
              quality work which is being done in this field. For students in logic,
              attendance at one or both of these ASL meetings is a necessary component of
              serious participation in the profession.

This will permit continuation of a
              successful program that has been administered by the Association since 1993 and
              partly funded by NSF since 1997.
