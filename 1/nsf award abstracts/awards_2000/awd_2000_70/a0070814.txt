Abstract    :
              The proposal is in the area of the theory of hypergeometric
functions
              associated to root systems, and their q-deformations.
A number of key results
              have been obtained by the investigator
in the course of previous NSF supported
              research. These results
have led to the resolution of various conjectures of
              Dunkl,
Macdonald, Koornwinder and others. It is proposed to examine
some of
              the outstanding problems in this area, which have to
do with certain
              positivity conjectures of Macdonald, Stanley, and the
proposer.

The
              research described above should lead to a better understanding
of several
              different areas of mathematics including algebra, 
representation theory,
              combinatorics, analysis, and multivariate 
statistics.
