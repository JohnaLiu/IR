Abstract    :
              This is a study of fundamental properties of turbulent jet diffusion flames. 
              New strategies are applied for using both particle image velocimetry (PIV) and
              plasma laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF), separately or simultaneously, to
              provide measurements useful for understanding flame phenomena or for validating
              numerical computations.  Flame stabilization measurements are made from
              lift-off condition to near-blowout conditions to investigate the applicability
              of the recent discovery of low-speed stabilization of edge flames to blowout
              conditions.  A novel PIV method is used for the measurements of entrainment
              into a jet in coflow that eliminates the uncertainties that occur when reaction
              takes place and can provide the entrainment coefficient as a function of the
              jet Reynolds number, Froude number, and axial distance downstream. 
              Measurements of CH are made to examine the nature of the actual flame surface
              over a number of variables including jet velocity, coflow speeds, and the
              influence of buoyancy.  This effort is coordinated with the NASA Stanford
              Center for Turbulence Research which is attempting to apply large-eddy
              simulation (LES) to coflow flames.
