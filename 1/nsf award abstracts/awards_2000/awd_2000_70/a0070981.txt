Abstract    :
              Prof. Anderson is going to work on several projects studying quantum
effects as
              they relate to both black holes and cosmology.  For black
holes he will study
              the question of how quantum fields alter the
temperatures and entropies of
              black holes, as well as what happens at
the end ofthe black hole evaporation
              process.  In cosmology he will
investigate whether quantum effects can cause a
              very rapidly expanding
universe to become unstable and expand in a different
              way than it
otherwise would, as well as study particle production in the
              universe
after it underwent an extremely rapid period of expansion
              called
inflation early in its history.

By studying the details of how
              quantum fields affect black holes one
can address such questions as what is
              left after a black hole finishes
evaporating and is there any new physics that
              is required to describe
the evaporation process.  By studying particle
              production in the early
universe one can investigate exactly how the matter
              and radiation in
the universe were created.
