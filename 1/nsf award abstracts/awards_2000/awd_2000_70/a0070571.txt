Abstract    :
              The investigator and colleagues study various objects involving the 
              combinatorics of geometric intersections.  These include the characteristic 
              classes of oriented matroid bundles as defined by Gelfand and MacPherson,  the
              configuration spaces of simplices first studied by Schubert and  an application
              related to work of Sarkaria to extensions of Tverberg's  theorem proposed by
              Kalai.  Oriented matroid bundles are a combinatorial  analog of vector bundles
              for which a classifying space is known.  The  cohomology of this classifying
              space is studied.  The spaces of simplices  are singular moduli spaces which
              arise in geometric ennumeration problems  as well as in the study of
              generalized Schur modules.  A combinatorially  defined resolution of
              singularities is defined and its intersection  properties studied.  Tverberg's
              theorem has conjectured extensions by  Kalai involving the dimensions of the
              Tverberg points.  The relationship  to the deleted join of simplices with the
              symmetric group action is studied.  

This work relates several previously
              studied approaches to the intersections  of geometric objects to finite
              mathematical problems.  This will provides  a better understanding of both the
              finite objects in question, as for instance  in the third case above, and of
              the geometric objects, as in the second case  above.  These finite objects
              arise frequently in both computer science  and physics, and further
              understanding the relationships to geometric  objects could have an impact on
              these fields.
