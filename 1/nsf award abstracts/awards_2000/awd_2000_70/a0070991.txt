Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical physics will concern the long-distance properties of the
              strong nuclear force.  Studies will be done using mathematical techniques,
              explorations of related physical problems and finally, new numerical methods. 
              These investigations will shed light on the confinement of quarks inside
              strongly-interacting particles, which is one of the most important problems of
              the theory of these particles.
