Abstract    :
              This project, conducted by Dr. Thomas J. Wenzel and undergraduate students at
              Bates College, is supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program.
              The research, which is a part of NSF's Research in Undergraduate Institutions
              (RUI) initiative, develops and utilizes combinations of chiral NMR shift
              reagents to resolve mixtures of enantiomeric substrates.  The chiral component
              of the shift reagents includes calixarenes, calixresorcarenes, crown ethers,
              cyclodexrins and amino acid derivatives. Paramagnetic lanthanide ions are
              coupled to the chiral solvating agents to achieve improved enantiomeric
              resolution in NMR applications.  Information from 2D NMR, computational,  x-ray
              crystallographic, and lanthanide shift and relaxation studies are used to
              determine if the mechanism that leads to enantiodistinction is specific enough
              to allow absolute configurations to be assigned.    

As new  pharmaceuticals
              are being more quickly developed, improved techniques for  differentiation of
              optical isomers become increasingly important . This research develops
              techniques to improve such differentiation.  As a result it will help assure
              the efficacy and safety of many new pharmaceuticals.
