Abstract

Bipolar transistors that operate at a lower voltage than existing
              devices would have a big impact on wireless communications and other
              battery-powered applications. The operating voltage of a bipolar transistor is
              determined by the bandgap of the constituent semiconductor, thus bipolar
              transistors in low bandgap semiconductors are needed.
The only viable
              semiconductor family with lower bandgaps than those already used for bipolar
              transistors is the so-called 6.1 material family, named after the value of
              their lattice constant.
The heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) is the
              prevalent bipolar transistor design in III-V semiconductor material families.
              It would seem natural to develop HBT's in the low bandgap 6.1 materials, but
              this cannot be done. The HBT is incompatible with the 6.1  materials, so an
              alternate type of bipolar transistor is sought. Such a transistor is the
              tunneling emitter bipolar transistor (TEBT). 
This program will study the
              TEBT's in the low bandgap 6.1 semiconductors. The effort will be along three
              lines: physics, materials and device engineering. The physics involves certain
              tunneling processes required by the TEBT. The materials work is the development
              of the epitaxial structures for the TEBT in the 6.1 materials. The device
              engineering (and fabrication and testing) of TEBT's will initially aim at a
              transistor exhibiting a substantial (>40) dc current gain, and follow up with
              engineering the device for rf performance.
