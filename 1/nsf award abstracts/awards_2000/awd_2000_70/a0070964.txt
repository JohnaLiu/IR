Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical particle physics will proceed in two main
              directions.
For a number of years now, theorists have been deeply interested
              in the
role that gravity plays in the interaction of the many
              microscopic
particles of high energy physics and how one may unify all the
              forces of
nature with gravity. A leading theory to understand this is string
              theory.
Strings are extended objects whose different oscillations describe
              the
different particles. Strings are one dimensional objects, and
              two
dimensional objects such as membranes and even higher dimensional
              objects
called "branes" can exist and are believed to play a fundamental role
              in
unifying the forces. This framework for describing the forces of
              nature
will be developed further and the important issue of seeing how
              Einstein's
theory of general relativity emerges from the general unification
              will be
investigated.

It is generally believed that the laws of physics
              will be modified at
higher energies from the currently known laws that hold at
              low energies.
Over the next five years, high energy accelerators, experiments
              to detect
the dark matter in the universe, and satellite experiments on
              cosmology
will be able to test this. There are now several leading proposals
              as to
what the nature of these new laws might be, and research will be
              carried
out to determine the signals that might show up at these experiments
              that
will allow us to infer from the experiments the new fundamental laws
              of
nature.
