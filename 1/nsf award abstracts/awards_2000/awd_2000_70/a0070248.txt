Abstract    :
              Soil reinforcement using geosynthetics is a very attractive alternative for
              highway embankment and retaining wall projects because of the economic benefits
              it offers in relation to cenventional retaining structures.  Desigh of
              reinforced soil slopes is typically performed using software-based techniques
              (limit equilibrium), which require significant assumptions regarding the
              distribution of strains within the reinforcement elements.  However, to date,
              the assumed strain distributions have not been fully validated against
              monitored results.  One consequence of this is a perceived overconservatism in
              design.

The overall objective of this research initiative is to generate and
              integrate (via centrifuge modeling, digital image analysis, and finite element
              analysis) data that will provide a definite answer regarding the strain
              distribution to be adopted in reinforced soil slope design.  Specificaly, this
              project will integrate results from the following five phases: (i) a centrifuge
              modeling investigation undertaken to generate experimental data on the
              performance fo geosynthetic reinforced soil slopes under working stress
              conditions; (ii) a digital image processing and analysis effort performed to
              collect and evaluate strain information from inflight-captured images of
              videotaped centrifuge models; (iii) a numerical (finite element) study
              performed to compile parametric evaluations of reinforced soil slope behavior,
              after having calibrated numerical procedures against data collected in the
              previous experimental phase; (iv) an evaluation effort to incorporate findings
              on reinforcement strain distribution into current reinforced soil guidelines;
              and (v) an educational component to integrate digital video clips of centrifuge
              geotechnical models into multimedia presentations to be used for undergraduate
              and graduate geotechnical instructions as well as for recruitment of
              underrepresented minority high school students into engineering programs.

In
              addition to the specific goal of refining design guidelines for geosynthetic
              reinforced soil slopes by gaining better understanding of the pattern of strain
              distributions, the proposed research is the cornerstone of larger, ongoing
              agendas under active development on reinforced soil research by the PI and on
              geotechnical modeling at the PI's institution.  In fact, the proposed
              investigation will initiate implementation of innovative procedures invilving
              digital image analysis in geotechnical centrifuge testing at the University of
              Colorado, will contribute to ongoing efforts of cross-validation between
              physical and numerical modeling of geotechnical systems, and will foster
              integration of research into engineering education.
