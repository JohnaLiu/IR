Abstract    :
              The investigator will study a number of different questions concerning the
              arithmetic of abelian varieties and special values of L-functions. His methods
              will involve developing new approaches that have their origins in arithmetic
              Galois module theory. The topics of investigation include: Iwasawa theory of
              abelian varieties, elliptic units and anticyclotomic Euler systems, and
              Tamagawa number conjectures arising via certain L-functions. He will also study
              some problems concerned with equivariant algebraic geometry and the K-theory of
              varieties over finite fields.

The research described in this proposal lies
              in the field of arithmetic geometry. This is a subject that blends two of the
              oldest branches of mathematics--number theory and geometry-- and which has
              blossomed to the point where it has solved problems that have stood for
              centuries. It finds applications in fields of science as diverse as physics,
              robotics, data processing and information theory.
