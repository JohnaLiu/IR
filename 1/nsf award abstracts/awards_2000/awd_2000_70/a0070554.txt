Abstract    :
              Research will be performed on theoretical astrophysics and particle physics,
              focusing on physical processes that took place early in the history of the
              Universe. According to the Big-Bang model, the early history of the Universe
              was characterized by extremely high temperatures and densities. In such an
              environment, matter was broken down to its smallest constituents, i.e.,
              elementary particles. In order to reconstruct the physical processes that took
              place during such times and to examine possible consequences observable today,
              we must obtain a description of how these particles interacted at high
              temperatures. In this research we will examine these processes, focusing on how
              the "fields" describing such particles arrived at their states of lowest
              energy, where they are today.
