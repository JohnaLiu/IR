              Abstract.

This proposal is concerned with interactions between the
              representations of quivers, geometry and representation theory.

The
              investigator will study the rings of semi-invariants of quivers and the
              combinatorial invariants they define. Special attention will be paid to the
              cone of weights of such rings and its relation to representation theory.  In
              the special case of triple flag quivers this amounts to studying the cone
              defined by Klyachko inequalities.  The principal investigator will also study
              the generalized quivers associated to reductive groups and their
              semi-invariants as well as the products of homogeneous spaces with finitely
              many orbits.

Quivers are just oriented graphs.  Their representations
              provide a convenient coding scheme allowing to study classification of objects
              arising in various areas of mathematics.  The classification of matrices by
              their ranks and Jordan classificaton of endomorphisms of a vector space are the
              simplest examples.  The more complicated ones include representations of
              classical groups and their generalizations to infinite dimensional algebras. 
              Studying such classification problems, and conditions under which they can be
              explicitly solved is central in mathematical research.  The investigator and
              his collaborators found that new interesting results can be obtained by using
              methods of invariant theory which were neglected before.
