This FASEB Conference on Amyloid and other Abnormal Protein
              Assembly Processes, aims to bring together cell biologists and clinicians
              familiar with the biology of abnormal protein deposition, with geneticists,
              molecular biologist and biophysicists to work toward an understanding of the
              molecular basis of this phenomenon. This conference will provide a forum to
              promote increased awareness of protein deposition as a process of biological
              importance which exhibits significant molecular structure and specificity.  The
              focus is on the molecular basis of protein aggregation and other manifestatons
              of protein-protein interactions.  The speakers will include leaders in these
              fields as well as young investigators.  The format of the FASEB summer
              conferences enables free exchange of ideas and interaction of participants.
