              Summary

Differential operators on operator algebras have been
              studied
extensively as a model for the infinitesimal time development
of a
              quantum-mechanical system, either isolated or interacting
with a macroscopic
              system. The proposed research involves a
study of differential operators on
              von Neumann algebras building
on the investigator's prior work on the special
              case of first-order
differential operators.

Operators on a Hilbert space
              are infinite analogs of finite
matrices. They have applications throughout
              mathematics, but
the proposed research relates specifically to
              mathematical
physics. Von Neumann algebras of operators have been used to
              model
certain quantum mechanical systems, particularly those arising
              in
quantum statistical mechanics. The proposal involves using ideas
of Fields
              medalist Alain Connes to study the time-evolution of
these algebras, with the
              double aim of clarifying the general
theory and giving insight into specific
              examples.
