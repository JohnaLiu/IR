Abstract    :
              This award is for the partial support of a series of conferences in the field of
              Dynamical Systems in the Spring of 2001, 2002 and 2003. The goals of the
              conferences are "to facilitate interaction and progress in dynamical systems
              and related fields ... and to contribute to the training of graduate students
              and recent Ph.D. recipients". The strength of the group of organizers at the
              University of Maryland and past successes of the conferences held there suggest
              that the planned conferences will be successful as well. I strongly recommend
              the award.
