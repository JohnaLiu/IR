The proposed project mainly deals with  understanding of the
              structure, classification and
description of semisimple Lie groups as well as
              their discrete subgroups.  We are investigating problems arising in connection
              with number theory and geometry.  The techniques we have used involve the
              theories of algebraic groups, arithmetic groups, dynamical properties of flows
              on homogeneous spaces and infinite dimensional unitary representations.

A
              semisimple Lie group and its lattices are special collections of symmetries of
              a geometric or arithmetic object.  This research aims to contribute to
              understanding of the symmetries whose
study has proven to be one of the
              central themes in mathematics and physics. Some of these has found remarkable
              applications in such fields as computer science and quantum mechanics.
