"An Automated DNA Sequencer for the
              Department of 
Biological Sciences, The University of Alabama"

Accumulating
              genomic data provides an opportunity to examine evolutionary relationships
              within a wide variety of aquatic species.  On going phylogenetic studies of
              snails, bivalves, sunfishes, basses, and zoosporic fungi provide a wealth of
              information on the ecology, biogeography, and evolution of morphological and
              life-history features of these diverse groups. 

An automated DNA sequencer
              will be used to conduct genomic studies more efficiently and accurately on
              vertebrates, invertebrates, and microorganisms.   The specific equipment to be
              used is the LI-COR 4200S-2 Gene ReadIR DNA Analysis System.  The LI-COR system
              produces high quality raw image data by electrophoretically separating labeled
              DNA and automatically scanning gels for fluorescence at two infrared (IR)
              wavelengths.  LI-COR produces high accuracy reads and eliminates the need for
              radioactive labeling.  In addition to DNA sequencing, the LI-COR system has
              hardware and software capabilities for microsatellite DNA research. 

 In
              addition to increasing research productivity and output, this equipment will
              provide excellent training opportunities for students with an interest in
              biotechnology and genomic research.  Virtually all DNA sequencing is conducted
              today with an automated sequencer.  Having the equipment in the Biology
              Department will provide valuable hands-on training and increase the
              competitiveness and knowledge base of graduate and undergraduate biology
              students at the University of Alabama.
