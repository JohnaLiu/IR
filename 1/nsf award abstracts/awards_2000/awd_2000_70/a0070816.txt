The focus of the proposal is the development of a method
              of complex
horospheras for real affine symmetric spaces, including real
              semisimple
Lie groups. We anticipate to apply this method to the construction
              of the
models of series of representations and to the decomposition of the
              regular
representations on series on the language of Hardy spaces
              of
cohomology. As one of application we hope to give an integral geometrical
              proof of the product-formula for c-function of Harishi-Chandra. Another
              direction of my research is the investigation of geometrical and analytic
              properties of
the crowns of Riemann symmetric spaces - their canonical
              Stein
neighborhoods.
	
Integral geometry is a branch of geometrical analysis
              which
investigates integral transforms associated with different
              geometrical
structures. The principal challenge is to find a geometrical
              setting, more
general than the group one, where it is possible to develop a
              non-abelian
harmonic analysis. Another direction considers complex
              constructions
responsible for the geometry of real affine symmetric spaces.
              Such
phenomena have roots in classical geometry of Poncelet and Pluecker.
