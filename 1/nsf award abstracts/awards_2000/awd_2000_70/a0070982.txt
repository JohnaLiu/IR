Abstract    :
              This project provides retraining workshops to deaf and hard-of-hearing adults in
              the information technology (IT) field, clusters these workshops into a
              certificate program, and modifies the workshops into undergraduate courses. A
              critical national need exists for individuals trained in IT and for constant
              upgrading of their skills. Deaf and hard-of-hearing IT professionals have
              difficulty in obtaining training and skills development that meets their
              communication and learning style needs, even with an interpreter.

The
              sponsoring institution is a two-year technical college for deaf and
              hard-of-hearing students. It was established to reverse the long history of
              underemployment 
and unemployment among our nation's deaf and hard-of-hearing
              citizens. The project provides funds for professional development for the
              entire faculty. This time is used to enhance IT skills, develop curricula and
              offer IT workshops to deaf and hard-of-hearing adults already in the national
              workforce or preparing for IT employment. The project establishes a new
              computer laboratory to support workshop activities, and to allow faculty to
              incorporate new information technology material into the full-time
              undergraduate curriculum.
