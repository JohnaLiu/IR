This conference "Protein Folding and Assembly in the
              Cell" is the sixth in a series of FASEB conferences, and aims to bring together
              cell biologists, geneticists, biophysicists and biochemists to look at protein
              folding and misfolding.  Interdisciplinary approaches are important since
              biological constraints are critical in formulating theory and interpreting in
              vitro data.  The setting of the conference at the Vermont Academy in Saxton
              River, permits informal discussion as well as formal presentations.
