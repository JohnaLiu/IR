Abstract    :
              Research in nuclear and particle astrophysics will investigate microscopical
              issues concerning neutrinos in dense matter and their role in supernovae,
              including their explosion and synthesis of heavy elements. A major goal is to
              more accurately calculate observable signatures of neutrinos in terrestrial
              detectors. This will be accomplished by the creation of an improved code to
              study neutrino flows within proto-neutron stars and emerging neutrino spectra
              for all neutrino flavors. Among the important theoretical issues to be
              addressed are the possible mixing of neutrinos from one flavor to another and
              fundamental calculations of neutrino-matter interactions. The net production of
              supernova neutrinos over cosmological times will be investigated to determine
              if these relics are observable.
