Reinforcement learning is a summary term for a collection of
              methods for approximating solutions to stochastic optimal control problems.  RL
              methods leave been successfully applied to a large array of such problems in a
              diversity of domains, including finance, logistics, telecommunications, and
              robot control.  Although similar problems have been studied intensively for
              many years in control engineering and operations research, the methods
              developed by RL researchers have added new elements to the classical solution
              methods.  RL methods offer novel ways to approximate solutions to problems that
              are too large or ill-defined for the classical solution methods to be
              feasible.

A significant part of RL research is directed at increasing
              on-line performance and speed of convergence by providing RL systems with
              domain knowledge.  This project is concerned with knowledge related to the
              design of stabilizing controllers for complex dynamical systems.  It will try
              to develop a general theory for incorporating this knowledge into RL systems. 
              The basic idea is to mathematically define policy subspaces that have certain
              known stability and safety properties and to focus exploration on control laws
              that lie within these policy subspaces.  The means by which this is achieved
              are based on the theory of Lyapunov stability and the associated methods of
              Lyapunov control design.
