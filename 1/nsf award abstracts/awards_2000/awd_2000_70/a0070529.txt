This project will supply shipboard scientific
              support equipment for the research vessel Pt. Sur operated by the San Jose
              State University Foundation, Moss Landing Marine Laboratories and dedicated to
              use in support of ocean science research.  The Shipboard Scientific Support
              Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the
              proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides
              support for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the
              deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such
              as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the location
              of research sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers and
              satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and other
              equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from
              data retrieval sites.  The Project Director, Kenneth H. Coale is fully
              qualified to direct this project having had considerable experience in
              overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.  This
              project will allow the institution to acquire a Single Side Band Radio.
