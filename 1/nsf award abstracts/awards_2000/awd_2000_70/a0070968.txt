Abstract    :
              
This proposal requests funding for allowing the Maryland group to analyze data
              from the Milagro Detector, to partake in the operation of the detector, and to
              take care of certain aspects of centralized data management.  Milagro's
              scientific goals are:
Perform the first all-year monitoring of TeV emission
              from the known flaring sources Markarian 421 and Markarian 501. 
Perform the
              first surrey of the northern sky for steady and episodic sources.
Perform the
              first sensitive search for emission from GRBs from -100 GeV to many
              TeV.
Detect VHE emission from the Crab and measure its energy spectrum with a
              new, independent technique.
Detect the shadow of the moon with high
              significance and use it to calibrate the energy response of the detector and to
              perform a search for high-energy cosmic antiprotons.
Detect the shadow of the
              sun with high significance and use it to continuously monitor the strength of
              the transverse component of the solar magnetic field.
Perform the most
              sensitive search for evaporating primordial black holes.
Measure ground-level
              proton events produced by solar coronal mass ejections in a higher energy
              regime and over shorter time scales than ever before possible.
