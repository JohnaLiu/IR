Abstract    :
              The American Power Conference (APC) sponsored by the Illinois Institute of
              Technology (IIT) , is an annual national forum for the discussion of the broad
              technical aspects of generation, transmission, distribution, and utilization of
              electric power.  APC has significant educational value particularly for
              undergraduate students who aim to learn more about the electric power industry.
               In recognition of this fact, IIT has been conducting  a special program for
              faculty and students, called the Ben Elliot Sponsored Student/Faculty (SSF)
              Program.  The program features special breakfast seminars and other
              events(e.g., plant tours, cracker barrel) expressly for students in addition to
              the regular APC technical sessions.  The proposed participant support grants
              will significantly aid the Ben Elliott SSF Program in its mission of
              encouraging more students (especially undergraduates to pursue careers in power
              engineering.
