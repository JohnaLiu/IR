Abstract    :
              One of the main problems in the Differential Dynamics is the analysis of
              dynamical systems with non-uniform hyperbolic behaviour.  In this connection
              
D. Kosygin and I work on the construction of standard maps without
              KAM-islands.  Another problem which is an essential part of the proposal is to
              study Navier-stokes equations with random forcing and to investigate properties
              of their stationary distributions.

	One of the main problems in the theory
              of chaos and differential dynamics is to study dynamical systems with the
              mixture of regular and chaotic behaviour.  One part of the proposal is devoted
              to the study of a big class of such systems which includes the famous standard
              map.  I am also planning to work on various problems of mathematical and
              statistical hydrodynamics.
