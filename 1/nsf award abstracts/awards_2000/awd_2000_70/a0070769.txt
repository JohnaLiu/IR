Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT:

The goal of the  project is to establish the 
singularity of 
              harmonic measure 
and of  Hausdorff measure on some totally
              disconnected,
uniformly perfect sets (subsets of the real line or
Julia sets
              of rational functions). The results rely on 
estimates of logarithmic
              capacities, Green's function 
and  harmonic functions near the boundary of
              plane domains. 
It combines potential theoretic  arguments with ergodic theory
              
and  dynamical systems,and uses techniques introduced by Carleson,
 Jones
              and Wolff, Makarov and Bourgain.




The fractal sets I will study
              represent the chaotic part of 
a dynamical system. Almost all the  phenomenon
              in life 
are dynamical systems: complex ones like  weather,  earthquakes 
and
                spreading of disease, and simple ones, 
like  the game of
              billiard.
Harmonic functions and potential theory were first of interest to
              
physicists and engineers, particularly in the fields of 
thermodynamics and
              electro-magnetics. All the successes 
in waves today stem from this theory.
              
The transmission of signals electro-magnetically between antennas,
the
              design of antennas and their placement in arrays is one of 
the current 
              problems that apply  potential theory.
