Abstract    :
              Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is a basic component of the Standard Model of
              fundamental forces.  It is the force that binds the atomic nucleus, forming
              protons and neutrons from their more elementary constituent particles called
              quarks and gluons.  The theory of QCD is indispensable in the search for novel
              physical laws at high-energy accelerator laboratories in the U.S. such as Fermi
              National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford Linear Accelerator Laboratory,
              Brookhaven National Laboratory, and at others elsewhere in the world.  This
              grant will fund an intensive, week-long school in high energy physics which
              will familiarize advanced graduate students and postdoctoral fellows with a
              broad spectrum of topics in QCD.  In-depth presentations by well-known experts,
              both experimentalists and theorists, will be complemented by extensive
              discussions between students and lecturers.
