Abstract    :
               
Materials technology and science are an integral part of the manufacturing
              process and a key area of technician education. However, many academic and
              vocational instructors do not have experience in new materials technologies. To
              meet the materials training and curriculum requirements of high school and
              community college technology instructors, a curriculum and training center for
              Enhancement of Materials Technology for manufacturing (EMTECH) is being
              established at Edmonds Community College (EdCC), in Lynnwood, Washington. The
              project builds upon prior work in the areas of curriculum development, teacher
              training and student programs in Materials Technology, and upon participants'
              input from related NSF ATE Projects. In addition to a permanent facility at
              EdCC, EMTECH is utilizing facilities at high schools, community colleges,
              universities, professional organizations, and industry located throughout the
              nation as required for training and special workshops. Teacher training
              workshops are being held at three partner community colleges: Metropolitan
              Community Colleges, Kansas City, Missouri, Sinclair Community College, Dayton,
              Ohio; and Hudson Valley Community College, Troy, New York. The proposed project
              includes a clearinghouse to provide instructors nationally with the resources
              needed to help their students make better design and manufacturing process
              choices. These resources are being provided through workshops, field trips,
              curriculum development and materials, professional society and industry
              contacts, and Internet web pages.
