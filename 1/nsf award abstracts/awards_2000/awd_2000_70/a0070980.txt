Abstract    :
              This award focuses on the use of strong electromagnetic fields to achieve
              control over processes involving the interaction of intense laser light with
              atoms and negative ions.  Control of high-order harmonic generation, energies,
              intensities, and angular distributions are considered using hallf-cycle pulses.
