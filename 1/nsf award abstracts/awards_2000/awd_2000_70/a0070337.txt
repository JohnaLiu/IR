Abstract    :
              Dr. Ferbel proposes to hold an Advanced Study Institute on Technology and
              Concepts of High Energy Physics.  The subjects to be covered are Symmetry
              breaking, quantum chromodynamics, neutrino mass and oscillations, cosmological
              parameters and baryon asymmetry.  The goals of this Institute are: to advance
              the training and instruction of exceptional young physicists in particle
              physics, and to extend contacts among outstanding scholars from different
              countries.
