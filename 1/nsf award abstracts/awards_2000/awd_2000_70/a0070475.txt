Abstract    :
              
The purpose of this research in the area of theoretical particle physics
is
              to study aspects of supersymmetry and supergravity, which are main
ingredients
              in the description and analysis of superstring theory.
Superstring theory is
              the major candidate theory for the study of the
fundamental constituents of
              matter as well as the unification of all 
the forces between them, including
              gravity. The viability of superstring
theory depends crucially on the
              existence of supersymmetry, a concept
that tells us that at some fundamental
              level elementary particles, though
superficially distinct in their properties,
              share an underlying identity
which allows them to be considered as different
              facets of a single
entity. By studying supersymmetric theories, of which
              supergravity
is the one relevant for string theory, we learn how to analyze it
              and how
to perform calculations and gain information which ultimately
will
              allow us to confirm that with this beautiful theory we have
indeed reached the
              goal of understanding how Nature works at the most
basic level.
