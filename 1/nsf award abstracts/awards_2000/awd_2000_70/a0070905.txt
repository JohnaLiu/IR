The goal of this project is to study quantum field theory
              models
with full mathematical rigor. This is useful to clarify the
structure
              of quantum field theory, and to  enhance its
predictive power.  Quantum field
              theory is primarily a theory
of elementary particle physics, but it also has
              an important
role to play in  classical statistical mechanics. Specific
              goals
are as follows.
(1.) A construction of quantum electrodynamics
on a
              three dimensional  torus.  This is a step toward control
of quantum
              electrodynamics  and/or quantum chromodynamics in
four dimensions, both of
              central importance in physics.
(2.) The construction of a non-Gaussian fixed 
              point for the
renormalization group for an  N-component scalar field in
              three
dimensions.  This would be  progress toward understanding a wide
range
              of critical phenomena.
(3.) A study of the Higgs mechanism for non-Abelian
              gauge fields
on a lattice. The Higgs mechanism is an important feature
              of
theories of the weak interactions.
