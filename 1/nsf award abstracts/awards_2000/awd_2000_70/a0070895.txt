Abstract    :
              This grant is to search for a unified theory of the fundamental laws that apply
              universally to all physical systems, which has been a longstanding challenge
              and goal for physics.  A current view is that there are two parts to any "final
              theory" of these basic laws.  The basic dynamical law (for example string
              theory) is one part; a theory of the initial quantum state of the universe is
              the other.  The dynamical law predicts regularities in time; the initial
              condition predicts regularities in space, in particular the regularities that
              occur on large, cosmological scales.  The research that will be supported by
              this grant thus bears directly on these longstanding, basic physical questions.
               The recent remarkable progress in both string theory and cosmology makes this
              research especially timely.
