Abstract    :
              Quantization of the gravitational field remains an outstanding
problem in
              theoretical physics. Recent developments in identifying an
appropriate set of
              basic variables and in handling the technical
problems known as first- and
              second-class constraints allow new methods
to be used to attack this problem.
              These new tools will be further
developed, and their application to study
              quantum gravity will be
continued.

All the basic forces of nature known at
              present have been successfully
reconciled with quantum theory, except for the
              gravitational force. A
successful union of gravity and quantum theory, would
              complete our
picture regarding the fundamental properties of nature.
