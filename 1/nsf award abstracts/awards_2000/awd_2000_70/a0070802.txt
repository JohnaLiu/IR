Abstract    :
              With the advent of third and fourth generation wireless infrastructure, and the
              simultaneous emergency of pervasive connectivity for all devices based on
              bluetooth like systems and ad-hoc networks, a new vista is open for research in
              the area.  We propose ideas for a research program aimed at realizing
              ubiquitous computing systems based on the cooperation of autonomous, dynamic
              and adaptive components (hardware as well as software) which are located in
              vicinity of one another.  These systems will be composed of a collection of
              independently designed components that automatically become aware of each
              other, establish basic (wireless) communication, exchange information about
              their capabilities and requirements, discover and exchange APIs, and learn to
              cooperate effectively to accomplish their individual and collective goals.  The
              proposed work will enable a new class of applications that effectively use
              mobility and pervasive computing.  We address several research problems that
              span the fields of distributed computing, data management, and dynamic
              collaboration between components.  The team of researchers is located at UMBC
              and UI-Chicago, and plans to interact closely with collaborators at industrial
              labs (IBM, Hughes, Sun).
