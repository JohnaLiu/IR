              Abstract

The proposed goal is to produce nanostructured aerosols by room
              temperature synthesis. Unlike the aerosol flame synthesis procedure, it should
              produce non-oxidized powders with reasonably large specific surface areas. Such
              a technique was demonstrated earlier by the PI in the formation of
              nanostructured titania and silica from mixed vapor streams devoid of the
              traditional solvents. This "aero-sol-gel" reactor can produce continuously
              meso- and microporous metal oxides, with tunable specific surface areas ranging
              from 100 to 700 m2/g , for a very limited invested cost. Parallel organic
              processes are also considered, with a view to produce nanostructured hybrids of
              organic and metal oxides. Rapid removal of volatile byproducts is expected to
              accelerate the chemical process and prevent the collapse of the nanopowders
              pores. A number of applications could replace existing technologies, with
              better qualities and at lower cost. Two target applications are proposed: one
              is the organic elastomer reinforcement with "tuned" nanostructured silica; the
              other one is the creation of ultra-violet absorbing nanostructured titania for
              such chemicals as polymers or paint. The precision in the design and
              manufacture of such aggregates is essential to their effectiveness; this part
              of the proposed research will be accomplished in coordination with several
              important high technology industries.
