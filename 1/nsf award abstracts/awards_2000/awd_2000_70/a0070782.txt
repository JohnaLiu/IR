Abstract    :
              Abstract:  
Garnett will work on several problems in classical one
              dimensional
complex analysis.  The first problem is to approximate any
              Blaschke product
uniformly on the open disc by Blaschke products whose zeros
              are 
sufficiently spread apart and thin that the corresponding Riesz mass
              is
bounded in all holomorphic coordinate systems (i. e. is a Carleson
              measure)
The approximation should be effected using explicit
              constructions.
The second problem is to exhibit large compact sets whose
              complements
do not support nonconstant bounded analytic functions.  The third
              problem
is a corona problem for infinitely connected plane domains whose
              boundaries
lie on rectifiable Jordan curves.  It too requires some new
              explicit 
constructions.  The fourth problem is to show that a Jordan curve
              
depends continuously on its welding map, which is the correspondence on
              the
unit circle that connects the conformal mapping of the inside of the
disc
              to one side of the curve and the outside of the disc to the 
other side of the
              curve.

The methods to be used on these problems will be constructive so that
              they
can be give explicit computer aided constructions of analytic
              functions
and conformal mappings.  Analytic functions and conformal mappings
              have
broad applications in fluid dynamics, acoustics, and electrical
              engineering,
and in these applications constructions  are more useful 
than
              general existence theorems.
