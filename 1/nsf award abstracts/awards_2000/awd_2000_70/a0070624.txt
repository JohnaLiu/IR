Abstract    :
              The project evolves around the goal of improving the applicability of general
              relativity (the Einstein equations and the equations of motion) to
              astrophysical issues, from gravitational lensing to gravitational radiation. 
              Both these fields are currently emerging as new astrophysical tools for the
              study of the structure and evolution of the universe.  Regarding the former,
              the project would focus on the theoretical aspects of gravitational lensing
              from a rigorously relativistic perspective. Specifically, the proposer would
              concentrate on the lens equation and on the distortion of images by strong
              gravitational fields, topics normally treated by means of approximation
              techniques.

With respect to gravitational radiation, the project would focus
              on the theoretical aspects involved in the prediction of gravitational
              waveforms via numerical simulations.  Specifically, the project looks at the
              evolution of the Einstein equations in normal time and in retarded time, with
              the aim of finding configurations of equations, gauge, initial data and
              boundary conditions well suited for numerical evolution.  The project, in part,
              would concentrate on scenarios with well defined Newtonian limits as the speed
              of light approaches infinity.
