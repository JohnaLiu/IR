Proposal Title: 	Impulse Propagation and
              Backscattering in Granular Beds

Project Abstract

Sound propagation in
              granular beds, such as in soil, has been studied for more than a century.
              However, little is known about the propagation impulses and of large amplitude,
              low frequency (less than 1 kHz) sound waves in granular beds. The propagation
              of impulses and of low frequency sound waves can only be described by taking
              into account the strongly nonlinear Hertzian forces, which make the grains
              repel nonlinearly upon intimate contact. The mathematical difficulties
              associated with such studies have hindered progress in studying impulse and low
              frequency wave propagation in granular beds. The proposed research will exploit
              recently developed theoretical advances and particle dynamics simulations to
              focus upon studying the dynamics of impulse and low frequency sound propagation
              in polydisperse granular assemblies. The possibility of exploiting
              backscattered impulses and low frequency acoustic waves to detect buried
              objects in granular beds will be addressed in this study. The effects of the
              presence of water in the inter-granular space on impulse propagation will also
              be analyzed. The studies will lead to the development of an algorithm to
              reconstruct a computer image of a buried object using surface based analyses of
              the backscattered acoustic impulses from such an object. An important
              application of the study will be for purposes of detecting buried antipersonnel
              landmines in nominally dry soils that are buried at depths of less than a foot
              in soil and kills nearly 2000 civilians each year.
