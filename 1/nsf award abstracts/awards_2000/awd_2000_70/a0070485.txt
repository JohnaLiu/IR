Abstract    :
              This project is focused on documenting the diversity of small mammals,
              amphibians and reptiles in the northern forests and fringing islands of
              Madagascar.  Surveys will be made on 21 forested areas on mainland Madagascar
              and 108 nearby islands, in order to document the distribution and abundance of
              species of terrestrial vertebrates and their external parasites.  This 5-year
              project will provide new information for about 71% of the vertebrate species of
              Madagascar, which is vitally needed for establishing conservation priorities
              for both the mainland environments and the islands.  Many species of
              Madagascarene amphibians and reptiles are known from only a few specimens
              collected 50-150 years ago.  Some of these "lost" species were rediscovered
              during recent surveys of the mainland, and it is likely that others still
              surviv in unexplored forest refugia on the mainland and fringing islands.  In
              addition to documenting the biodiversity of terrestrial vertebrates and
              facilitating conservation initiatives, this project will provide vast amounts
              of new information about the external parasites of the sampled vertebrates. 
              Preliminary information from our previous surveys revealed eight families of
              parasitic mites unknown for Madagascar and more than 400 species.  This vast
              new realm of biodiversity information promises to have a major impact on our
              understanding of the historical biogeography of Madagascar's fauna.
