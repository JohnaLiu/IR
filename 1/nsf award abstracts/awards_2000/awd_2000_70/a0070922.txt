The relationships between composition and structure of
              calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) will be established.  C-S-H will be treated as
              a colloidal material that has been successfully modeled for one composition as
              being made up of particles with about 1 NM radius.  They are clustered together
              to make a structure exhibiting particular surface areas and densities that
              depend on the size of the sample, i.e. the resolution of probe.  Neutron
              scattering and gas sorption provide two powerful techniques for investigating
              the structure.  The model will be extended to include C-S-H with a range of
              compositions, produced through the control of chemistry.
