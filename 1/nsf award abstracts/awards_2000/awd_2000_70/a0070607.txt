Harmonic Analysis on Lie Groups and Spectral Symmetry

Abstract

Tis project deals with a variety of problems in
              modern analysis and science relating the interplay between geometry, symmetries
              in the form of group actions, and harmonic analysis on Lie groups and symmetric
              spaces. The program is motivated in part by questions in mathematical physics
              and quantum field theory involving generalized causality and reflection
              positivity.
The proposal combines different branches of mathematics. This
              includes
complex
analysis through Hardy spaces, analytic continuation of
              representations,
and the generalized Bargmann-Segal transform; geometry in
              form of symmetric spaces, duality and compactification; integral transforms and
              representations of Lie groups.  Several parts of the program are to be done
              collaboratively with colleagues in the USA and Europe.
