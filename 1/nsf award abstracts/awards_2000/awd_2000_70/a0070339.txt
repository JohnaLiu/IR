Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) will operate
              R/Vs Atlantis, Knorr and Oceanus during 2000 as a general oceanographic
              research vessel in support of NSF-supported research projects.

The R/V
              Atlantis is a 274 ft. vessel, constructed in 1997, and is owned by the U.S.
              Navy and operated by WHOI.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 303
              operational days during 2000, of which 262 days are in support of NSF-supported
              investigators.  The remaining cruises will support NOAA and other private
              projects.  The projects scheduled on the Atlantis represent several
              oceanographic disciplines and will fully utilize the capabilities of the
              vessel.  Operations will take place in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans in
              support of submersible operations of the National Deep Submergence Facility
              utilizing DSV Alvin, ARGO II, Jason, and DSL-120.  Cruises will take place in
              the Gulf of California, Northern East Pacific Rise, Juan de Fuca Ridge, Gulf of
              Mexico, and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  The ship will return to Woods Hole in
              December 2000 for the overhaul of the DSV Alvin.  Scheduled maintenance on the
              Atlantis will take place in part of February and March.

The R/V Knorr is a
              279 ft. vessel, constructed in 1969 and refitted from 1989 to 1991, and owned
              by the U.S. Navy and operated by WHOI.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of
              311 operational days during 2000, of which 221 days are in support of
              NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining cruises will support Navy projects.
               The projects scheduled on the Knorr represent several oceanographic
              disciplines, utilizing full capabilities of the vessel.  Projects scheduled
              include LWAD, Prod Drill testing, mooring deployments, and use of Jason.  The
              vessel will operate in the North and South Atlantic Ocean:  Caribbean,
              Mid-Atlantic Ridge, Brazil Basin, and Sargasso Sea; the Mediterranean; and off
              the coast of Cape Town, South Africa.  A maintenance period is planned for
              mid-October to mid-November.

The R/V Oceanus is a 177 ft. vessel,
              constructed in 1975, and owned by NSF and operated by UCSD-SIO.  The vessel is
              scheduled for a total of 140 operational days during 2000, of which 69 days are
              in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining cruises will support
              Navy, NOAA, and USGS projects.  The projects scheduled on the Oceanus support
              several oceanographic disciplines and will fully utilize the capabilities of
              the vessel.  Scheduled cruises are in support of the ECOHAB Program,
              seismic/OBH work, mooring deployments and Navy acoustic programs.  Operations
              will take place off the North Atlantic Coast on the U.S. Continental Shelf and
              the Grand Banks.  The ship will be out of service the first three months and
              last two months of the year.

The R/Vs Atlantis, Knorr, and Oceanus are part
              of a fleet of ships used by the National Science Foundation in support of
              marine science research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly
              specialized equipment to be permanently installed on the vessels, thus the
              necessity for specialized ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same mode
              as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of a
              variety of ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are
              operated by universities and institutions around the country.
