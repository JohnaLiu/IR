Abstract    :
                  Analytic number theory is the branch of pure mathematics in which one
              applies tools from analysis to study the distribution of the prime numbers and
              other interesting sequences such as the sequence of squarefree numbers.  Tools
              from analysis include Fourier analysis, Fourier and Laplace transforms,
              automorphic forms and spectral theory, sieve methods, and character theory and
              exponential sums.
     A Kloosterman sum is a particular exponential sum that
              is frequently encountered in multiplicative number theory.  While individual
              Kloosterman sums are known to satisfy general upper bounds, Kuznetsov proved a
              trace formula for GL_2 and used it to show that weighted sums of Kloosterman
              sums satisfy much sharper bounds.  In 1982, Deshouillers and Iwaniec published
              a groundbreaking paper extending Kuznetsov's trace formula and combining it
              with the large sieve.  Their resulting bounds on sums of Kloosterman sums is
              now know as 'Kloostermania" and has had a large number of applications to
              multiplicative number theory during the past decade.   This is a proposal to
              re-examine the Kuznetsov trace formula and the Deshouillers-Iwaniec paper, with
              the goal of improving the Deshouillers-Iwaniec results.
