Abstract    :
              A broad program of research in theoretical physics and astrophysics will
be
              carried out by John Bahcall and Edward Witten of the Institute for
Advanced
              Study and by a large number of postdoctoral fellows and more
senior visitors.
              Topics to be pursued include the behavior of neutrinos
from the sun, the
              possibility that neutrinos have mass, the relations
between apparently
              different string theories of the fundamental forces,
basic questions in
              quantum field theory, and various topics in cosmology.
These are all areas in
              which exciting progress is being made, and further
research is expected to be
              very fruitful. Neutrinos are among the most
abundant elementary particles in
              the universe, and string theory is a very
promising candidate for a theory
              which can unify all of the basic forces
of nature.
