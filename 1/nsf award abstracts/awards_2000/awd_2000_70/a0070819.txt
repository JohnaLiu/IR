Abstract    :
              Positronium is an ideal laboratory to study bound state quantum field theory. 
              The present work focuses on the calculation of the energies and decay rates of
              the low-lying levels of positronium.  Theory and older experiments are in
              disagreement on the spin-triplet decay rate.  A more recent experimental
              measurement of this rate is in much better agreement with theory.  The
              calculation of the O(a2) correction to the orthopositronium decay rate will
              check the earlier result and help resolve the current diagreement between
              experiment and theory.
