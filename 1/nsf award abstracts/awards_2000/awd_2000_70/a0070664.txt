The investigator and his colleagues study Hodge and Tate
              classes on abelian varieties  of low dimension with special reference to the
              possibility of obtaining all these classes from divisor classes and  Weil
              classes by means of linear algebra.  They study isogeny classes of abelian
              varieties over number fields without principal polarizations with special
              reference to explicit constructions of such isogeny classes that carry only
              polarizations whose degree is divisible by a given positive integer.  The
              investigator studies the endomorphism rings of hyperelliptic and trigonal
              jacobians.

The project deals with various symmetries associated with
              so-called abelian integrals.  These integrals and their hidden symmetries may
              be of help in constructing more efficient codes, as well as in writing down
              explicit solutions to important equations.  The aim of this project is to
              control certain hidden symmetries when the dimension is small, and in arbitrary
              dimensions, to provide explicit constructions with just a few additional
              symmetries.
