Abstract    :
              Harmonic Analysis is to be enhanced with combinatorial ideas and applied
to
              develop representations by products and quotients evaluated at the
primes. 
              Immediate aims include the complete multiplicative generation of
the positive
              rationals by shifted primes, and the solution of a thirty
year old problem of
              Katai concerning sums of additive functions on
arithmetic progressions.  An
              ultimate aim is the celebrated problem of
Goldbach and the infinitude of twin
              primes.  The value distribution of
primitive roots is also to be
              studied.

The project aims to develop in number theory a flexible general
              theory of
arithmetic functions strong enough to attack certain
              classically
difficult problems.  All three of the topics to be considered
              directly or
indirectly involve the multiplicative generation of rationals by
              given
rationals of a restricted form.  Positive results have
              immediate
relevance to the construction of algorithms to factorise integers
              and to
the theoretical study of encryption based upon the difficulties
              of
factorising large numbers.
