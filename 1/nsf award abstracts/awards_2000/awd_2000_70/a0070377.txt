An Automated
              DNA Sequencer for the Claremont Colleges

This award will allow Rancho Santa
              Ana Botanic Garden (RSABG) to purchase an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (with an
              XL-C upgrade) for use in the core sequencing laboratory that it provides for
              use by biologists at the Claremont Colleges. A highly reliable and accurate
              instrument, the ABI 377 will be used in a core sequencing lab to support
              research by six major users and a number of minor users at RSABG, Pomona
              College and Harvey Mudd College. Added to an existing ABI 373 currently
              operated by RSABG, the ABI 377 will increase overall lab productivity by at
              least ten-fold, allowing the laboratory to meet a rapidly growing demand for
              additional sequencing capability for a number of projects. 

The primary
              research projects are 1) population and conservation genetics of the endangered
              and endemic Hawaiian silversword alliance; 2) examination of reticulate
              patterns of diversification within Polemoniaceae; 3) evolution and
              classification of North American chloridoid grasses; 4) determinants of homing
              endonuclease I-Cre I function; 5) molecular phylogeny of hydra and construction
              of a molecular phylogeny of terrestrial Isopods; and 6) use of DNA sequence
              data to infer evolutionary relationships among Alcyonacean soft corals. 

The
              sequencer will also significantly strengthen education and training activities
              for graduate and undergraduate students in systematics, evolution, and
              molecular biology.
