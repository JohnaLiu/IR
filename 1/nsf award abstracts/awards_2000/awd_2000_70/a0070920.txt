Abstract    :
              Theoretical research into the the detailed dynamics of ultracold atom-atom and
              atom-molecule interactions are studied using quantum chemistry techniques to
              generate the required potential energy surfaces and close-coupling and
              algebraic variational methods for the dynamics.  There are strong links to
              ongoing experiments and there is a high priority placed on undergraduate
              training in atomic and molecular theory.
