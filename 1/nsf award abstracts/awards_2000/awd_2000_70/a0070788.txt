Abstract    :
              The proposal is for a 3-day conference at the Royal Academy of Sciences,
              Amsterdam in September, 2000 on the topic of "Eye movements and vision in
              natural tasks". The findings of research over the past few years have shown
              that even apparently simple behaviors, such as looking, reaching, or
              remembering the contents of a visual scene, are done differently and often
              better when performed under conditions designed to re-create the demands of
              natural tasks. The goal of this conference is to bring together researchers who
              are doing the most innovative work in understanding eye movements and vision
              under demanding, natural conditions. Natural conditions can be established by
              allowing freedom of head motion, by providing richly-structured 3-dimensional
              visual scenes, and by studying eye movements used to accomplish purposeful
              cognitive or motor tasks. The participants will be charged with the task of
              both presenting their latest original findings and outlining a vision for the
              future in a forum that will promote discussion and debate.
