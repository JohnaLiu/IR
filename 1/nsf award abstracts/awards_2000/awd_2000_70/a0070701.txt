              Abstract

This proposal is for partial funding to support an international
              conference on geometric and combinatorial methods in group theory and semigroup
              theory.  The aim of the conference is to bring together several of the world's
              leading researchers with research interests in groups and semigroups and their
              connections with topology, geometry, symbolic dynamics and symbolic
              computation. Emphasis will be on asymptotic properties and algorithmic
              problems.

This conference is in a field that is at the interface between
              group theory and semigroup theory (the mathematical  study of global and local
              symmetry) and computation.  The study of algorithmic problems in these settings
              is closely related to the understanding of "complexity of computation".  The
              conference will be held on the campus of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
              during the period May 15 - May 19, 2000.  There will be around 20 invited one
              hour lectures and several contributed talks. Special efforts will be made to
              support participation by graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.
