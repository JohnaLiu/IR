	This project will continue theoretical research on models of the
              strong interaction between nucleons.  The motivation lies in applications to
              few-body physics where  predictions of realistic models can be accurately
              computed and the results compared to complete experimental measurements.  We
              will continue to concentrate on meson exchange as the  useful and economic
              model of three-nucleon interactions and of the small but interesting breaking
              of 'charge symmetry' in the two-nucleon interaction.  We will explore the
              theoretical similarities between this approach to three-nucleon forces and the
              production of mesons from the collision of two nucleons.  Some new experiments
              study charge symmetry
breaking in meson production; the similarities proposed
              and explored in this project might help our understanding of these experiments.
              
Although our models and methods utilize meson exchange, the ultimate source
              of charge symmetry breaking lies in the different masses of the subunits of the
              nucleons called quarks.  We will continue field theoretical calculations at the
              quark level of meson properties due to quark mass differences, and compare with
              new experimental information on 'meson mixing' to provide a firmer basis for
              our models of 'charge asymmetry' in both the nucleon-nucleon interaction but
              also the less well known lambda-nucleon interaction.  We also will continue our
              studies of the neutron which are guided by the Dirac equation.
