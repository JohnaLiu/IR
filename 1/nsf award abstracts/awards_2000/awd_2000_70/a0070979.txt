              ABSTRACT

Hawley, John
"Magnetohydrodynamical Simulations of Black Hole
              Accretion"
AST-0070979

Hawley and Balbus are conducting a detailed
              theoretical and computational study of orbiting gas around gravitating compact
              objects.  Their approach will include both numerical simulations and analytic
              solutions for black hole accretion disks in a 3-dimensional
              magnetohydrodynamical framework.  The latter is essential because of the
              overwhelming influence of magnetic fields and relativistic forces on the
              accretion disks to be studied.  The principle focus of this project will be on
              developing a grid of realistic models for black hole accretion disks to which
              ground- and space-based observations can ultimately be compared.
