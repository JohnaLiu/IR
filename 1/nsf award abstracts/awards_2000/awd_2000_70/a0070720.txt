Abstract    :
              One of the most enduring problems of prime number theory is to determine
how
              many elements remain when a set of numbers is sieved.  There is a
              large
literature on this topic, originating in seminal papers of Viggo Brun in
              1914,
but even today the best known bounds are either not optimal or not
              proved
to be optimal.  By starting with a simple sieving situation and then
              moving
incrementally to more complicated configurations, it is hoped that
              optimal
bounds can be found, accompanied by proofs of optimality.  The past
              work
on the PI on the pair correlation of the zeros of the Riemann zeta
              function
has been interpreted as providing evidence that the zeros are
              spectral
in nature.  The Pair Correlation Conjecture itself is equivalent to
              an
assertion concerning the mean square distribution of primes in short
              intervals.
In new work with k. Soundararajan, it is proposed to extend the
              second moment
heuristics to other moments, and hence develop heuristics
              concerning the
distribution function of primes in short intervals.  It is hope
              that this
new information, when interpreted in terms of zeros of the zeta
              function,
will provide further insights concerning the distribution of the
              zeros,
including the Riemann Hypothesis.

The seemingly irregular
              distribution of prime numbers has been a puzzle
to mathematicians for many
              centuries.  In the early 20th century, new
ideas were introduced, which
              allowed one to deal with sieving for primes
as a problem of linear
              programming.  This led to many new results, but
even today the linear
              programming extremals remain to be found in most
situations.  By starting with
              a simple situation and moving incrementally
to more complicated ones, it is
              hoped that it will at last be
possible to locate the extremal configurations. 
              Heuristics concerning
the distribution of primes in short intervals can be
              developed from the
Hardy--Littlewood prime k-tuple conjecture, and the
              insights gained from
such reasoning has an impact on other aspects of prime
              number theory,
including the famous Riemann Hypothesis which dates from 1860.
