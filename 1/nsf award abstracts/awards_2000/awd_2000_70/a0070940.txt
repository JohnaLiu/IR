Abstract    :
              Research in cosmology and particle physics will focus
on the nature and
              distribution of dark matter in the universe.  Using very high resolution
              simulations and other methods, the project will investigate all the issues that
              have been raised concerning the hypothesis that cold dark matter (CDM) makes up
              most of the dark matter in the halos of galaxies.  If any of these issues
              actually turn out to be serious problems, it may mean that the main component
              of dark matter in galaxy halos and on larger scales is not CDM, and it may give
              us clues regarding the properties of the dark matter.  The project will also
              study the implications of the simulations and data for dark matter detection
              via the detection of the mutual annihilation of particles that make up the dark
              matter.  The research will also study the constraints on cosmological
              parameters, including neutrino mass, from cosmological structure formation, in
              particular the formation of far away galaxies.  This work is very important,
              since it will clarify the nature of most of the matter in the universe.
