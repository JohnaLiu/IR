Abstract    :
              	This collaborative project will be undertaken with Dr. Brian Mapes of CIRES and
              involves an investigation into the observed bimodal distribution of water vapor
              in the tropical upper troposphere.  The principal investigators will seek to
              identify the origins of the bimodality and the implications for the large-scale
              tropical circulations.  

Water vapor can play a major role in the dynamics
              of the atmosphere, even in the driest parts of the atmosphere, through
              radiative effects.  At the same time, moisture transported through convective
              clouds is a source of moisture, accompanied by latent heat release, in the
              upper troposphere.  The impact of water vapor on the circulation differs
              substantially between cloudy, convective regions of the tropics and unsaturated
              regions.

	The principal investigators will pursue both observational and
              modeling studies.  The first will include a survey on the scale, location, and
              time dependence of the water vapor bimodality and analysis of potential
              mechanisms responsible for the observed distribution.  In the modeling work,
              both a simple mechanistic model and an atmospheric general circulation model
              will be used to assess the impact on the tropical circulation.
