This project has as its goal the development of a novel
              technique for measuring the mass density of the universe. Knowledge of the mass
              density (called Omega_m) is critical for understanding the "fate" of the
              universe (whether open or closed) in most contemporary cosmological models.
              Several methods are currently in use for measuring this very important
              cosmological parameter but all give slightly different results. The technique
              to be used in this research is completely independent of the other techniques
              in use. It will be based on a series of computer simulations, each using a
              different mass density, of the observed spatial distribution of galaxies. The
              results of these simulations will then be compared with the true galaxy
              distributions as measured in new, large-scale surveys such as the Sloan Digital
              Sky Survey and the Las Campanas Redshift Survey. This new technique should
              provide a good, independent check on our current knowledge of the universe and
              its evolution.
