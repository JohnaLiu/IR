The University of Michigan Ann Arbor will operate the R/V
              Laurentian during 2000 as a general oceanographic research vessel in support of
              NSF-supported research projects.  The Laurentian is a 80 ft. vessel,
              constructed in 1974, and is owned and operated by The Regents of the University
              of Michigan.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 199 operational days
              during 2000, of which 199 days are in support of NSF-supported investigators. 
              The projects scheduled on the Laurentian represent several oceanographic
              disciplines, including geological and physical oceanography, and will fully
              utilize the capabilities of the vessel. Operations in 2000 will take place on
              Lake Michigan and Lake Superior.

The Laurentian is part of a fleet of ships
              used by the National Science Foundation in support of marine science research. 
              Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to be
              permanently installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships. 
              These vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.
               As a result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically
              dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by universities and
              institutions around the country.
