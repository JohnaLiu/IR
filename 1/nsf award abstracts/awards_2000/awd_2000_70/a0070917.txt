Abstract    :
              Abstract:
The work proposed is to study the connection
 between mixing
              properties of dynamical systems and their
statistical properties. The goal is
              to develop a general
approach that will enable us to obtain results on
              the
distribution of normalised return times in a wide variety
of settings
              including non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical
systems. This extends to the
              return time distributions for
the canonical invariant measure interval maps
              with parabolic points or
for equilibrium states for
rational maps which have
              critical points in the Julia set.
We expect to obtain explicit error terms for
              the distribution
of higher order returns of any order. Ultimately we hope
              to
extend our approach to L-S Young's `tower construction' which
 originally
              was introduced to obtain rates on the decay of
correlations.

 This area of
              research is of interest
to a wide variety of scientist. For instance
              experimentalists who want
to do numerical simulations will benefit from the
              proposed problems
which will assist them in developing more reliable ways
              to
numerically analyse time series of chaotic dynamical systems.
The proposed
              research can also serve to develop more efficient
data compression algorithms
              since it quantifies the error in the number
of times with which a newly coded
              sequence of symbols
occurs from its predicted average value.
