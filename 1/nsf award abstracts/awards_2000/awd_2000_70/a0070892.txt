Abstract    :
              Two problems in gravitational physics will be studied, each of vital
importance
              for the current efforts to detect  gravitational waves and
characterize
              gravitational wave sources.  First, gravitational waves
from core-collapse
              supernovae will be analyzed using a
three--dimensional computer code based on
              the Newtonian/quadrupole
approximation. This work will determine whether
              dynamical instabilities
succeed in producing a highly elongated or fragmented
              inner core, with
a correspondingly large gravitational-wave signal. Second,
              the
``Einstein--Christoffel" hyperbolic formulation of general
              relativity
will be analyzed with particular emphasis on developing a
              stable,
accurate numerical algorithm. Progress will be made toward developing
              a
numerical relativity code that encorporates a high-resolution
              shock
capturing scheme.

Such codes will be needed to investigate the role
              that gravitational
shocks might play in astrophysical systems.  Also, these
              simulations
constitute an important step toward determining whether
              gravitational
waves from supernovae can be detected by receivers such as LIGO.
