Balantekin
	The proposed area of research is in the area of
              theoretical
physics with an emphasis on understanding results from
              the
ongoing experimental activity in the United States and abroad. A
number
              of different projects will be carried out with the
participation of younger
              scientists who recently received their
doctorates and those who are currently
              working on their doctoral
dissertations in the research activity of the senior
              scientists. 
	The projects will include efforts i) To
              understand
energy-producing activity in the core of the Sun and other stars;
              ii)
To explore the origin and formation of heavy elements in different
sites
              around the universe; iii) To study the properties of tiny
particles called
              neutrinos that are produced both in the laboratory
and astrophysical settings;
              iv) To develop mathematical techniques to
model nuclei and similar complex
              systems; v) To understand how heavy nuclei break up when they collide in
              laboratory experiments; vi) To explore properties of unstable nuclei that are
              produced in the
laboratories. These projects are chosen not only to contribute
              to our
knowledge of fundamental physics but also to the training of the young
              people involved.
