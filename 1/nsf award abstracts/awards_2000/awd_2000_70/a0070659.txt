The proposer will investigate connections between Galois
              representations and modular forms in the context of two fundamental problems in
              algebraic number theory.  The first of these problems is to determine which
              Galois representations are associated to automorphic representations.  The
              second problem is to relate special values of L-functions of varieties or
              motives to associated algebraic quantities (such as orders of Selmer groups). 
              In the direction of the first problem the proposer intends to pursue extensions
              of his recent work on the modularity of various families of two-dimensional
              p-adic Galois representations. In particular, the proposer intends to explore
              possible extensions to representations of higher dimension.  In the direction
              of the second problem, the proposer will investigate the influence of
              divisibility properties of constant terms of Eisenstein series on higher-rank
              groups (which often involve special values of L-functions) on congruences
              between the Hecke eigenvalues of these Eisenstein series and those of cusp
              forms.

Both of these problems fall under the rubric "Arithmetic Geometry," a
              branch of mathematics which attempts to apply sophisticated mathematics to the
              often easy-to-state, but-hard-to-solve problems of number theory.  The problems
              most readily tackled by arithmetic geometry include 1) counting the number of
              integer solutions to systems of polynomials and 2) understanding L-functions
              (functions attached to systems of polynomials and which encode information
              about their solutions).  These problems are of increasing importance in
              applications.  Recent advances in computing, cryptography, and coding theory
              have depended on solutions to these problems as do many proposed advances in
              these areas.
