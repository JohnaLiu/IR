Abstract    :
              Professor Coyne proposes to:
1. Take part in the operation of the Milagro
              Detector. 
2. Take part in the Milagro scientific program.  The scientific
              goals of Milagro include searching for gamma bursts, monitoring AGNs for TeV
              gamma emissions, search for other transient gamma sources, search for
              antiprotons with the aide of the shadow of the moon and of the sun, and search
              for evidence of evaporating black holes.
Works toward sharing Milagro's
              finding with other members of the scientific community and with the public.
