Abstract    :
              The investigator proposes a program of research in axiomatic set
   theory. The
              program involves looking at a number of different
   questions, all of which
              involve  combinatorial set theory and are
   related to large cardinals and
              forcing; among the areas to be
   studied are mutual stationarity, identity
              crises for large
   cardinals, and combinatorial principles. The techniques to
              be used
   include Radin forcing, iterated forcing and PCF theory.

 
              Combinatorial set theory is a discipline whose goal is to take 
  familiar
              ideas about finite sets (such as counting, ordering and
  permuting) and
              extend them to the context of infinite sets. 
  The theory is highly developed
              and has found applications
  in several mathematical areas  where infinite
              sets  are used,
  including  topology  and analysis.   Progress  on the
 
              problems which are proposed by the investigator should increase our
 
              understanding of infinite sets, and help forge tools which will be
  useful to
              set theorists and workers in other areas.
