Abstract    :
              This project investigates a number of issues and problems in classical and
              quantum gravity and, in particular, Einstein's general theory of
              relativity.

The goal of work on these topics is to improve the state of
              knowledge regarding general relativity, gravitation and quantum mechanics, as
              well as the interaction of these branches of physics.
