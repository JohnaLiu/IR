              Abstract: 

This project is to try to obtain a better understanding 
of the
              structure of bounded linear operators acting on a complex, 
separable,
              infinite dimensional Hilbert space. The principal investigator plans to
              continue her research on the theory of commutant lifting theorem, including the
              numerical 
aspect and the generalization to the multioperator setting. 
At
              the same time, the principal investigator will continue her 
research on sums
              of eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators, 
and its connections with
              intersection theory in algebraic 
geometry, Young tableaux, and representation
              theory. 

This project is to try to obtain  a better understanding of the
              theory of linear
operators acting on Hilbert space (``operator theory'').
              There are two main 
research areas that this proposal will focus on. 
One is
              in the area of the theory of commutant lifting thorem, 
which has proven to be
              useful in control theory in engineering. 
The other one is on a problem about
              eigenvalues of sums of (self-
adjoint) operators. This problem originated in a
              celebrated 
paper of Weyl in 1912 while he was studying partial 
differential
              equations. Only recently that there was a 
significant break through and the
              solution depends on 
some very deep theorems in algebraic geometry. It is our
              
hope that this project will bring some insight into the 
problem from the
              operator theory point of view. Furthermore we want 
to extend the existing
              theory to a setting that can be applied to 
quantum physics.
