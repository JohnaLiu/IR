University of Alaska Fairbanks (Institute of Marine Science)
              will operate the R/V Alpha Helix during 2000 as a general oceanographic
              research vessel in support of NSF-supported research projects.  The Alpha Helix
              is a 133 ft. vessel, constructed in 1966, and owned by NSF and operated by UAF.
               The vessel is scheduled for a total of 124 operational days during 2000, of
              which 34 days are in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining
              cruises will support NOAA, State of Alaska, and the North Pacific Marine
              Research Program.  The projects scheduled on the Alpha Helix represent several
              oceanographic disciplines, including physical, chemical and biological
              oceanography, geology, benthic ecology and marine mammal behavior, and will
              fully utilize the capabilities of the vessel. The vessel will be used for a
              variety of projects such as maintaining moored arrays, providing a platform for
              instructional training and curriculum support, and supporting collaborative
              interagency research. Operations will take place in and around the Gulf of
              Alaska and the Bering Sea.

The Alpha Helix is part of a fleet of ships used
              by the National Science Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most
              oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to be permanently
              installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These
              vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a
              result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated
              to oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions
              around the country.
