Abstract    :
              The Principal Investigators are conducting research connecting combinatorics
              with various topics in algebra, representation theory, and algebraic geometry. 
              The specific areas include:  the theory of total positivity; combinatorial
              aspects of representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras; combinatorics of
              Coxeter/Weyl groups; and Schubert calculus. In addition, the proposers are
              developing free software to assist research in these areas.

This research is
              in the general area of combinatorics, the study of discrete structures.  One of
              the goals of combinatorics is to find efficient methods for the manipulation
              and enumeration of discrete collections of objects.  The behavior of discrete
              systems is extremely important to modern communications, and is an essential
              part of the mathematical foundations of computer science.  Combinatorial
              techniques are also of increasing value in older branches of mathematics such
              as algebra, geometry, probability and mathematical physics, since explicit
              computations often require a better understanding of the underlying discrete
              structures.
