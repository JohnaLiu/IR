Pick interpolation has, for the last 30 years, been a very
              successful
blend of functional analysis, operator theory and function
              theory.
The proposer intends to study it in the context of complex
              geometry.
The more specific goals are to understand interpolating sequences in
              
many algebras - not just the algebra of bounded analytic functions 
on some
              domain, but multiplier algebras of more general function spaces.
More
              generally, viewing interpolation problems as questions about
curvature, the
              proposer seeks to understand the geometry of the maximal
ideal
              spaces.

Feedback mechanisms have been used in engineering for a long
              time
to stabilize systems. The design of such systems is difficult,
not least
              because the system that one wants to stabilize is, in practice,
not known
              exactly, but only approximately. Many ad hoc approaches were
used, but about
              20 years ago an idea surfaced that enabled the problem
to be confronted
              directly. This was a form of control theory that allowed
robust stabilization.
              It relied on a mathematical technique
called interpolation - finding a nice
              function that takes certain values.
The aim of the current proposal is to
              greatly increase the class of
interpolation problems that can be solved, so
              that systems that must
operate under two qualitatively different constraints
              simultaneously can
be stabilized.
