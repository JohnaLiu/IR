Abstract    :
              The investigator will study applications of group theory to algebraic geometry. 
              More specifically, he will study those moduli spaces of algebraic-geometric
              objects that can be understood in terms of discrete groups acting on Hermitian
              symmetric spaces.  His tools will include the arithmetic properties of the
              groups and the construction of automorphic forms on the symmetric
              spaces.

Group theory is the study of symmetry, and examples of discrete
              groups are the symmetries of a chemical or mineral crystal structure.  Moduli
              spaces arise when one considers some geometric objects (say, surfaces in
              space), and considers two of them to be the same if they differ only in some
              minor way, such as a change in point of view.  It is surprising and deep that
              discrete groups can help one understand moduli spaces, but many beautiful
              connections have been discovered by many different people.  The investigator
              will look for more of these connections and try to better understand the ones
              already known.
