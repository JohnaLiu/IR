Abstract    :
              This project will focus on resolving primary picosecond and femtosecond dynamics
              under conditions of controlled size, density and distance, and to learn about
              structure-dynamics correlations and forces governing the transition to the
              condensed phase limit for various materials systems.  Ultrafast laser
              spectroscopy will be used to probe real-time molecular dynamics of
              nanostructures in the condensed phase, studies of the photophysical and
              photochemical dynamics of polymers and materials under high pressure, and the
              use of novel and non-linear laser techniques will be used to examine and
              control selective processes in inhomogeneous systems.

The potential for
              nanoscale materials and processes and their novel uses in various nanoscale
              device are just beginning to be realized for technologies such as
              communications, biotechnology, and various microelectromechanical systems. 
              Students trained in science and engineering areas that explore the physical,
              chemical, and biological properties of materials intermediate in size between
              isolated atoms/molecules and bulk materials, where phenomena length scales
              become comparable to the size of the structure, will be among those future
              scientists and engineers most relevant to advancing the emerging global
              economy.
