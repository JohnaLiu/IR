Abstract    :
              This award continues an extremely productive program in the theoretical
              treatment of electron collisions with atoms.  The project involves the use of
              perturbative, non-perturbative and time-dependent techniques to treat electron
              collisions with atoms containing two active electrons.  The PI has been
              extremely successful in training undergraduates in atomic physics.
