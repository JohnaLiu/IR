              Abstract,

The proposer intends to study the local structure of p-adic Galois
              representations attached to modular forms.  This study will be done via the
              theory of Fontaine.  The results of this study are needed in order to prove
              formulas relating the central values of the derivatives of the anticyclotomic 
              p-adic L-functions attached to modular forms, defined previously by the
              proposer and his collaborators, to global objects namely the image under the
              p-adic Abel-Jacobi map of the suitable Heegner cycle.

Galois representations
              have proven to be extraordinarily powerful tools for the study of Diophantine
              equations and their connections with geometry.  The most striking example of
              this power is to be seen in the recent work of Andrew Wiles, namely his  proof
              of ``Fermat's Last Theorem".  The study and understanding of Diophantine
              equations is essential for applications in  cryptography, computer science and
              other areas of general interest.
