              ABSTRACT

This mathematical research focuses on problems for
              nonlinear
equations of Monge-Ampere type and also for homogenization
              of
linear and nonlinear equations. For Monge-Ampere type equations,
the
              problems concentrate on the study of geometric properties of
their solutions
              and regularity. In particular, a question proposed
is to establish Holder
              regularity of derivatives of generalized
solutions for an equation that
              appears in geometric optics for the
synthesis of reflector antennas. The
              methodology that will be used
to solve this set of problems is using
              appropriate maximum
principles, localization and nonlinear variants of
              the
Calderon-Zygmund decomposition. Concerning homogenization, we
developed
              an abstract scheme that yields convergence in $L^p$
spaces of correctors for a
              large class of equations and
systems. We propose to investigate the validity
              of results of the
same nature for problems of homogenization in perforated
              domains.


This mathematical research is in the field of partial
              differential
equations, linear and nonlinear. These equations are the
              principal
classical tool of the applications of mathematics to the
              physical
world. The project has a strong connection with Harmonic Analysis
in
              Euclidean space, a subject that has flourished during the
second half of the
              twentieth century and that has become an
indispensable tool to provide
              qualitative and quantitative
information about the solutions of partial
              differential equations.
The problems proposed in the first part are motivated
              from the
engineering problem of construction of reflector antennas.
              The
second part of the project is related with the description of
              the
behavior of transmission of heat or electricity in materials
              with
periodic structure such us polymers, crystals and layered media.
In
              particular, we are interested in obtaining accurate
approximations of the
              solutions that describe these phenomena.
