Abstract    :
              The investigator studies the module theory of the algebra  of invariant
              differential operators on a simple complex Lie algebra, in particular, he
              studies finite dimensional modules.  He is currently considering the case of
              rank two Lie algebras, with success in the case of  the Lie algebra of type A. 
              The investigator and a colleague study commuting involutions on reductive
              algebraic groups, and the corresponding double coset spaces by the fixed groups
              of the involutions.  We determine the structure of the double coset spaces, and
              their relations to quotient spaces of special kinds of split tori by
              appropriate Weyl groups.

Symmetry groups, such as the collection of all
              rotations of a sphere, play a fundamental role in mathematics and physics. 
              Understanding these groups and the ways they can act is basic to our knowledge
              of the physical and mathematical universes.  Research on symmetry groups has
              been very active and productive for the last 75 years.  The investigator and
              colleagues study these symmetry groups, related mathematical objects,  and the
              different ways they can act and interact.
