Abstract    :
              The research project entitled "Surface Photochemistry and Interfacial Charge
              Transfer" will be conducted by Dr. J. Michael White from the University of
              Texas, Austin and is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry program.
               The research is focused in two areas.  (1)The study of photodissociation
              dynamics of adsorbed alkyl nitrite species on metals,  and (2) the study of
              charge transfer reactions of organic systems which function as light emitting
              diodes (OLEDs).  Dr. White has found that there are 3 pathways associated with
              the photodissociations.  Each pathway is affected by the surface substrate
              (metal), the adlayer structure, energy and method of excitation and the
              presence of coadsorbed species.  The first part of the research program will
              focus on elucidating the effects and separating the pathways.  The second part
              of the research program seeks to characterize the structure and electronic
              properties of adsorbed OLEDs and correlating these properties to luminescent
              characteristics.  Both of these projects will be carried out using state of the
              art surface characterization techniques.  Both projects will provide an
              important and fundamental understanding of photodissociation mechanisms and
              OLEDs.   

The results of this research will have an impact on the area of
              fundamental photochemistry of adsorbed species on metals and on the
              understanding of luminescence and how it is affected by structure and
              electronic properties.  The OLED studies could potentially have a broad impact
              on the development of new materials and devices.
