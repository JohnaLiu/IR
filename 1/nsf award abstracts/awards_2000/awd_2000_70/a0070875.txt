Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research on the mechanism(s) of iron uptake and release by the iron
              storage protein ferritin by Professor Donald C. Zapien of the Department of
              Chemistry at the University of Colorado-Denver. The way in which the protein
              shell responds to changes in oxidation state of the iron in the core will be
              determined, as well as how the differences in protein structure affect the
              electrochemical reactivity of the ferritin. The principal methodology to be
              employed is cyclic voltammetry of a single layer of ferritin adsorbed on the
              surface of a tin-doped indium oxide electrode. Changes in composition of the
              core before and after iron reduction will be determined by X-ray photoelectron
              spectroscopy, and changes in protein conformation by immunoassay. Both native
              and recombinant ferritins will be examined in order to elucidate the role of
              the H and L-chain subunits with regard to iron sequestration and
              discharge.

The goal of this research is to understand how the protein
              ferritin carries out its functions. The principal functions are to take up
              excess iron in biological cells, store the iron and supply it when needed. In
              addition to obtaining fundamental information on this important protein, the
              results will provide a basis for non-biological applications such as
              electrochemical assays. This Research at an Undergraduate Institution project,
              employing an integrated chemical and biochemical approach, provides an
              excellent training vehicle for a diverse group of undergraduate students. They
              will be well-prepared for either industrial employment or advanced study.
