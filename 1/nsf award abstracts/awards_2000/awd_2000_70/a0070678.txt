Abstract    :
              The main goal of the proposed project is to study the strong
              factorization
conjecture for birational morphisms: every proper birational
              morphism
between nonsingular complex varieties can be factored as
              a
composition of smooth blowups followed by a composition of
              smooth
blowdowns. The conjecture follows from the more
fundamental problem of
              making a morphism toroidal by smooth
blowups. There are several approaches to
              solving the toroidalization
problem, for example, reducing it to a problem
              about resolution of
singularities of a differential form with logarithmic
              poles, or using
a composition of several constructions in lower dimensions to
              achieve
toroidalization in higher dimension.

The main theme of the proposed
              research is to study the classification
of algebraic varieties. More
              precisely, given two varieties that are
the same generically (they are the
              same after removing some small
subsets), can one transform one variety to
              another by some elementary
operations? The simplest elementary operations are
              blowups and
blowdowns of subvarieties: replacing a subvariety by
              another
subvariety of larger (resp. smaller) dimension. The
              blowup-blowdown
conjecture states that one can always get from the first
              variety to
the second by blowing up several times and then blowing down.
