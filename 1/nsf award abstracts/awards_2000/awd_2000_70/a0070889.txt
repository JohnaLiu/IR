Abstract    :
              This US-Brazil award provides support for Dr. Akif Baha Balantekin, University
              of Wisconsin, to collaborate with Dr. L. Felipe Canto at the Universidade
              Federal do Rio de Janeiro in Brazil on fusion reactions and neutrino
              astrophysics.

This program is in the area of theoretical physics.  The
              emphasis is on low-energy fusion reactions taking place in stellar and other
              astronomical environments and problems in neutrino astrophysics.  In the former
              area, the research will concentrate on radiative capture reactions and related
              electromagnetic probes.  In the latter area, the research will focus on solar
              and supernova neutrinos.  Theoretical research in these areas is chosen to have
              a close coupling with the ongoing experimental programs in the US and Brazil.
