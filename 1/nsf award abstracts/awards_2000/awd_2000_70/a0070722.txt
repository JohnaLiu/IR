Abstract    :
              The main goal of the proposed project is to study the strong factorization
              conjecture for birational morphisms:  every proper birational morphism between
              nonsingular complex varieties can be factored as a composition of smooth
              blowups followed by a composition of smooth blowdowns.  The conjecture follows
              from the more fundamental problem of making a morphism toroidal by smooth
              blowups.  There are several approaches to solving the toroidalization problem,
              for example, reducing it to a problem about resolution of singularities of a
              differential form with logarithmic poles, or using a composition of several
              constructions in lower dimensions to achieve toroidalization in higher
              dimension.

The main theme of the proposed research is to study the
              classification of algebraic varieties. More precisely, given two varieties that
              are the same generically (they are the same after removing some small subsets),
              can one transform one variety to another by some elementary operations?  The
              simplest elementary operations are blowups and blowdowns of subvarieties:
              replacing a subvariety by another subvariety of larger (resp. smaller)
              dimension.  The blowup-blowdown conjecture states that one can always get from
              the first variety to the second by blowing up several times and then blowing
              down.
