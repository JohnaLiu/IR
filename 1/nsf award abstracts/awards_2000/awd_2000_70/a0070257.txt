Abstract    :
              This research project concerns some fundamental theoretical work in engineering
              design and manufacturing.  A mathematical structure for the design space for
              homogeneous geometric objects will be defined and studied.  Using this work,
              manufacturability will be examined and the classes of geometric objects that
              can be manufactured or that can be approximated by manufacturable artifacts
              will be characterized for material removal processes.

If successful, this
              research will provide a sound foundation for design optimization and design
              spate exploration.  It may lead to improved Computer Aided Design systems and
              better selections of algorithms for design optimization and design space
              exploration.  A further result will be a complexity concept for manufacturing
              as well as a rigorous measure of agility.  Finally, technology management will
              benefit from better information to use in making decisions about particular
              pieces of manufacturing equipment and the choice of whether to invest in
              dedicated or flexible machines.
