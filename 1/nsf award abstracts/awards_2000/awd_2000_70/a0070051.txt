Abstract    :
              The aim of this research is to develop a rigorous numerical model 
(primarily
              based on nonlinear fracture mechanics) to study the
deterioration of
              reinforced concrete structures (such as bridge decks)
due to the corrosion of
              rebars, atmospheric pollution, frost and mechanical load.
Coupling between
              these various effects with cracking will be considered.
This in turn, will
              lead to the better understanding of the deterioration process,
and improved
              predictive capabilities.Rather than focusing on the causes of the
              deteriorations (such as chloridediffusion, carbonation), we will focus on the
              end effect which is concrete cracking and its interaction/coupling with the
              mechanisms which lead to deterioration.
