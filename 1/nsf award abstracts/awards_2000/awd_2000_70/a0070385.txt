The investigators will work to understand several large scale features of
              the solar corona, including bi-modal magnetic fields, solar wind structure, and
              the interplay between coronal mass ejections (CME), solar prominences and solar
              flares. The main effort is to employ two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric and
              three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical codes to model these
              observed features of coronal activity. One unique aspect of the work is the
              approach adopted by the investigators to the interplay between various
              mesoscale and large-scale features of the corona. Specific topics of the
              research include CME dynamics in a bi-modal wind and study of Moreton waves as
              an interaction between coronal activity and the denser chromosphere beneath.
