	Our goal is to understand the structure of atomic nuclei from
              first principles---namely, in terms of the free nucleon-nucleon (strong)
              interaction and many-body quantum mechanics.  Toward this end, we havedeveloped
              a new "ab initio" shell-model approach, in which we treat all.  A nucleons as
              active particles in an extremely large basis (model) space.  We now have
              computer codes, which allow us to perform such calculations for nuclei up to
              A=16, i.e., 16 active nucleons, and have obtained reasonable and encouraging
              results for the light nuclei studied so far.  We are presently performing
              detailed calculations for A=6 and 7 to study the rate of convergence of the
              binding energies, spectra, radii, etc., as the size of the model space is
              increased.  A new computer code is now being tested to do calculations for 12C
              up to 10 million configuration space states, so that we can perform similar
              calculations for A=12 as we are now doing for A=6 and 7.
	One of our major
              accomplishments, to date, is the development of a technique for computing
              exactly the effective two-body shell-model interaction, which we have employed
              to solve the A=3 and 4 nucleon systems. From these exact solutions for A=3 and
              4, we can extract the effective three-body and four-body interactions.  We plan
              to utilize these effective three- and four-body interactions to construct an
              expansion for the effective A-nucleon shell-model interaction, which will
              greatly improve the convergence rate for our calculations.  In the near future
              we will also include a real three-body interaction in our shell-model
              investigations.
