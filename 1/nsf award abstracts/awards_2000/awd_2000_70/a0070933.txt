Abstract    :
              The PI proposes to:
Take part in the operation of the Milagro Detector. 
Take
              part in the Milagro scientific program.  The scientific goals of Milagro
              include searching for gamma bursts, monitoring AGNs for TeV gamma emissions,
              search for other transient gamma sources, search for antiprotons with the aide
              of the shadow of the moon and of the sun, and search for evidence of
              evaporating black holes.
