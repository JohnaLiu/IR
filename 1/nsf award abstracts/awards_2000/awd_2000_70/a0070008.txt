Abstract    :
              This is a Small Grants for Exploratory Research project to support travel and
              some transcription in support of oral interviews of approximately 50 people who
              were active in the early years of modern investigation of polar regions. The
              United States will soon lose a generation of pioneering scientists and
              explorers who led the way for scientific advances in polar regions. The people
              who participated in the expeditions of the 1920's, 1930's and 1940's and those
              who were the first scientists of the IGY established the modus operandi for
              field operations in use today. They possess a wealth of information and
              perspectives about the development and history of polar investigation that was
              not recorded; they are also in the final years of their lives. The
              interviewees, most of whom have been contacted and have agreed to participate,
              live in many places across the United States. A working list of more than one
              hundred people has been developed by using the membership list of the American
              Polar Society and expeditionary rosters from this era.  An advisory board will
              help to set priorities and provide guidance. Priorities will be based on such
              factors as age, state of health, and prominence of the interviewees. Funding
              from this project will send trained and experienced interviewers to meet with
              the scientists and to create the historic documents, i.e. the tapes, that will
              be a continuing resource for scientists and historians. Ohio State University
              will preserve the tapes and make them  available. From the experience of this
              project, the principal investigators expect to develop a continuing oral
              history program for polar science. This proposal is based on imminent need (the
              age and state of health of this generation of explorers and scientists) and on
              collaboration.  Captain Brian Shoemaker, as Secretary of the American Polar
              Society, and Dr. Raimund Goerler, as Chief Archivist of Ohio State University's
              Byrd Polar Research Center Archival Program, will work with an Advisory Board
              of persons prominent in science and in oral history, with staff of the Byrd
              Polar Research Center Archival Program, and with volunteers of the American
              Polar Society, an organization that began in 1935 to provide polar information
              for explorers and scientists.
