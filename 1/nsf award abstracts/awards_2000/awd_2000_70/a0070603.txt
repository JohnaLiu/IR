                                                ABSTRACT:

The principal research initiative
              results from a theory of Hilbert spaces of entire functions produced in the
              postdoctoral years 1957--1962 and from a related theory of Hilbert spaces of
              analytic functions then produced in joint work with James Rovnyak. A striking
              application was made in 1984 to a proof of the Bieberbach conjecture. Another
              research initiative results from a proof obtained in 1959 of the
              Stone--Weierstrass theorem. An application to the invariant subspace problem
              was made in 1991 by Victor Lomonosov. Existence theorems for invariant
              subspaces are currently pursued by methods of the Stone--Weierstrass theorem
              and of Hilbert--spaces of analytic functions.
Hilbert spaces of entire
              functions are being applied to a proof of the Riemann hypothesis.

The
              significance of the present work lies in its effective combination of
two
              research concepts, a classical concept whose aim is to solve difficult
              problems, and a modern concept whose aim is to introduce
              innovative
techniques. The test of success is measured by the successful
              application of
new methods to old problems. The Riemann hypothesis has been a
              consistent aim of the present work since the doctoral thesis. A successful
              conclusion of
this longstanding project would be a major contribution to
              mathematics.
