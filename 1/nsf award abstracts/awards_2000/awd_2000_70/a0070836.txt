Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will explore and
clarify
              the internal structure of the particles, known as hadrons, which
interact with
              each other by means of the strong nuclear force. The
research will use
              numerical techniques in which the continuum of space is
replaced by a discrete
              lattice of points. The numerical calculations will
be carried out on the
              supercomputers at the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA).
              Computer algorithms will be
investigated for the extraction of subtle new
              physics effects caused by
the admixture of strange quarks in the proton. This
              can lead to a better
understanding of the internal structure of hadrons and to
              better
techniques for similar calculations. In addition, an important
              new
algorithm for simulating quark dynamics will be thoroughly
              investigated.
This algorithm has the potential to increase the efficiency of
              such
simulations and to more directly simulate the underlying physics.
