Abstract    :
              Theoretical investigations into the effects of strong confining potentials on
              the interactions of cold atoms are studied using many-body Green's function
              techniques.  The objective is to define the theory in terms of renormalized,
              two body scattering matrices which can be obtained from the interactions of
              free atoms.
