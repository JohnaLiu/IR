Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical physics will be concerned with the fundamental
              properties of neutrinos.  There are lots of neutrinos around, for example there
              are estimated to be 10 billion neutrinos for every atom of `normal' matter.
              
However despite this the fundamental properties of neutrinos are poorly
              known.  This is because neutrinos interact only weakly with `normal' matter and
              so are difficult to study. After several decades of effort, experiments have
              only recently begun to reveal their properties.  Many new experiments are
              planned, some using particle accelerators such as the one at Fermilab to send
              neutrinos hundreds of miles through the Earth.  Calculations will be performed
              to clarify the implications of the present and upcoming observations.  Also,
              calculations will be performed to find the implications of the revealed
              neutrino properties for the evolution of the early universe.  These studies are
              important because how the universe formed is sensitive to the properties of
              neutrinos, and also because neutrino properties provide a unique insight into
              the fundamental nature of all particles and forces.
