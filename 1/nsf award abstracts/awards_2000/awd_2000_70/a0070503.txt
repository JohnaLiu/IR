Abstract    :
              The objective of the cooperative research project is to apply categorical
              
methods of modern representation theory to classification problems of
              
linear algebra.  Professors V.V. Sergeichuk (Ukraine) and R.A. Horn 
(Utah)
              will develop a universal method for reducing the problem of 
classifying
              systems of forms and linear mappings to the problem of 
classifying systems of
              linear mappings, and will apply this new method to 
known canonical form
              problems.  They will also give miniversal 
deformations of the canonical
              matrices that they obtain;  that is, they 
will find a simplest possible
              normal form, to which not only a given 
matrix, but also an arbitrary family
              of matrices close to it, can be 
reduced by means of an admissible
              transformation that depends smoothly 
on the entries of the matrix
              entries.

Elaboration of general methods for solving classification problems
              of 
linear algebra is of great practical importance since matrix problems
              
underlie most methods of modern computational mathematics.  Students in
              
science and engineering first meet matrix problems when they study 
systems
              of linear equations.  An investigation of miniversal deformations 
of matrices
              is important for applications in which one has matrices that 
arise from
              physical measurements, which means that their entries are 
known only
              approximately.  Thus, one is compelled to study the structure, 
not only of a
              given matrix, but also of all matrices close to it.
