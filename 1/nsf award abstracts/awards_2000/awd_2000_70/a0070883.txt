Abstract    :
              Quantum Chromodynamics or QCD is the currently accepted and well-tested theory
              which sums up our knowledge, to date, of quarks, which are the fundamental
              constituents of nuclear matter, and of gluons, the particles responsible for
              nuclear forces.  The collisions of heavy atomic nuclei at the relativistic
              heavy ion collider (RHIC) in Brookhaven is expected to produce a new state of
              matter, the so-called quark-gluon plasma, which will provide an important new
              testing ground for QCD, with extreme conditions for various physical parameters
              such as pressure and temperature, and thus potentially leading to further
              elucidation,
confirmation or extension of the theory. The expected weakening
              of interparticle forces under such conditions, the so-called screening effects,
              will be an important ingredient in the interpretation of data from RHIC.

In
              this project, theoretical investigations of different types of screening
              effects in the quark-gluon plasma, as well as a number of related questions,
              will be carried out. The basic mathematical strategy, which is an extension of
              previously used techniques, will be to relate QCD to suitable theories in lower
              and higher number of spacetime dimensions, an approach which has provided
              significant new insights recently.  Wherever
appropriate, results obtained
              will be correlated with numerical computer-based analysis of such theories.
