Abstract    :
              The project is in the realm of Number Theory. More specifically, it is in
the
              area of automorphic forms and representation theory.
The most ambitious
              enterprise in automorphic forms is the
Langlands program,
and, especially,
              the issue of functorial lifting.
Loosely speaking, it postulates the formation
              of automorphic forms on
a bigger group from those on a smaller group.
This
              bounds together some of the most outstanding open problems in Number
Theory,
              such as the Artin's Conjecture
and the Ramanujan Hypothesis.
So far, the
              advance in the Langlands program was accomplished along
three major themes
              which are inter-related: explicit constructions of
automorphic forms
(e.g.
              using theta-kernels or Fourier coefficients of residues of
Eisenstein series),
              the theory of L-functions combined with
converse theorems, and the trace
              formula in its various guises.
The focus in this project is on the trace
              formula approach.
All trace formulas have their origin in expressing the
              kernel function
in two different ways -- geometrically and spectrally.
The
              application to functoriality comes about
when trace formulas of two different
              groups are compared.
The project deals with analytical aspects of the spectral
              expansion
of a trace formula for {\em symmetric spaces} (also called
              a
relative trace formula), inaugurated by Jacquet.
This is a major step in
              establishing functoriality in such instances
as quadratic base change, and
              characterizing cusp forms having
a non-zero period integral over certain
              period subgroups.
The project has 3 parts and it is a collaboration
              with
Jonathan Rogawski from UCLA (first 2 parts), and
Steve Rallis and Herve
              Jacquet (third part).

The project is a basic research in the realm of Number
              Theory.
The more specific area is called
automorphic forms and representation
              theory.
The most ambitious enterprise in this field is the
Langlands
              program.
In a nutshell, the goal is to establish relationships
              between
various objects which "live" on completely different worlds,
and
              seemingly have little in common.
Such relations are extremely deep.
A
              spectacular and relatively recent example is a correspondence between
modular
              forms and elliptic curves, which was
a keystone in Wiles' proof of Fermat's
              Last Theorem.
Roughly speaking, an elliptic curve is a "doughnut"
which is
              described as the locus of two equations
of degree 3 in 4 variables.
A modular
              form on the other hand can be thought of,
in the simplest cases, as
a
              sequence which is obtained by assigning to each integer
the sum of all its
              divisors (or powers of them).
Beside their inherent significance in many
              branches of mathematics,
modular forms and their related objects have found
              applications
in physics, cryptography and communication systems.
