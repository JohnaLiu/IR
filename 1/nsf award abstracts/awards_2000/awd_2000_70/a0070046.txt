Abstract    :
              Six faculty members and their students in the Biology Departments at Bryn Mawr
              and Haverford Colleges will use a Nikon laser scanning confocal microscope for
              studies in cell and molecular biology. This system includes a Nikon Eclipse
              E800 Upright Research Microscope, a Nikon PCM-2000ML scanning confocal with two
              multi-lines lasers, an argon ion laser (457 nm, 488 nm and 514 nm) and a HeNe
              green laser (543 nm), a transmitted light detector, and a quantitative 2D/3D
              software package. The Nikon scanning confocal microscope will greatly
              facilitate and broaden the scope of research performed by the Biology faculty
              at Bryn Mawr and Haverford Colleges by providing a state-of-the-art system for
              detailed image acquisition and analysis. 

Each investigator will incorporate
              the scanning laser confocal microscope into their independent research
              programs.  These programs address a variety of molecular, cellular and
              developmental questions, including calcium imaging of plateau potentials in
              leech neurons; assembly of synaptic proteins in developing rat sympathetic
              neurons; cell proliferation in chick embryonic neuromeres; control of meiosis
              in C. elegans; molecular basis of programmed cell death in T lymphocytes, and
              biogenesis and regulation of microtubule containing structures in
              Chlamydomonas.

The acquisition of the Nikon scanning confocal microscope
              will also enrich the research experience of undergraduate biology majors at
              Bryn Mawr and Haverford Colleges, which is a major component of science
              education at both institutions. It will also benefit the graduate program in
              Biology at Bryn Mawr College by providing a high quality research tool for
              developing investigative skills.
