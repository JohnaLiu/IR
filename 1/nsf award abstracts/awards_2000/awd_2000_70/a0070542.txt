Abstract    :
              Chang proposes to continue her study of problems in conformal geometry involving
              higher order elliptic operators and systems. The main theme is to study the
              integrand of the Gauss-Bonnet formula on 4-manifolds via a fourth order
              elliptic operator with leading term the bi-Laplace operator called the Paneitz
              operator. Three research projects are proposed. The first one connects the
              study of the integrand to the study of Monge-Ampere equations. The second one
              is to extend her earlier work on the regularity of bi-harmonic maps to a
              general setting. The third one is to generalize the classical work of
              Cohn-Vossen and Huber relating the growth of the Gaussian curvature to the
              Euler 
characteristic from complete surfaces to complete 4-manifolds.

     
              The main motivation of the project is to study the geometric and topological
              structure of manifolds via analytic methods--mainly via the study of the
              partial differential equations satisfied by the curvature of the
              manifold.
