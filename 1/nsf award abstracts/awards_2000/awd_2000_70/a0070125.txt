Abstract    :
              1.3-mm vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) is an enabling device for
              future optical 10Gbit Ethernet and local area network. In the present proposal,
              we propose a novel approach to make 1.3 mm VCSELs on GaAs substrates with a
              single step epitaxial growth. The basic idea is to use an
              InxGa1-xAs/GaPyAszSb1-y-z/InxGa1-xAs type-II quantum well (QW) structure as the
              active region. Our preliminary theoretical and experimental studies of the
              proposed type-II QW structure have shown that the idea is feasible. A detailed
              theoretical model has been used to calculate the transition energies, overlaps
              between electron and hole wavefunctions, and gain spectra for the type-II QW
              structures. The results show that a gain of 8000 cm-1 can be reached under an
              electric injection of 10.1018 cm-3. Based on the theoretical design, several
              test samples for photoluminescence and LED structures have been grown by a
              specially configured molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) machine.   TEM images clearly
              show well-defined QW structures.  Strong room temperature photoluminescence
              from the QW samples and electroluminescence from the LEDs have been clearly
              observed. 

In the present proposed program, we will focus on three major
              tasks: 1) Further detailed theoretical modeling of gain spectra and optimized
              device structures of different variation of the proposed InGaAs/GaPAsSb type-II
              QWs; 2) MBE growth and materials characterization of the new QW structures to
              understand various growth related issues and find the optimized growth
              conditions for the VCSELs; 3) Detailed physics study of the carrier life time
              and optical properties of the InGaAs/GaPAsSb type-II QWs using low temperature
              cw and time resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy; 4) Device demonstration of
              cw VCSELs.

In the proposed program, 2 PhD students will be supported.  There
              will be also several undergraduate students to be involved in part of the
              program through their senior design projects.
