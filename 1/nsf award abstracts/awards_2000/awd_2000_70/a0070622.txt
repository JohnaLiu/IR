Abstract    :
              This is a request for support for the 42nd Maize Genetics Meeting to be held
              March 18-21, 2000 at Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. This meeting includes all members of
              the maize community and provides an opportunity for graduate students to meet
              and interact with senior scientists in the field of genetics and biology in a
              setting conducive to such interaction. The students are given the opportunity
              to discuss their research ideas at poster sessions and/or talks and to begin to
              establish the scientific networks that will prove invaluable throughout their
              careers. The NSF has supported this meeting for all of the years that support
              has been requested. The reports from scientists who have attended the meetings
              have been uniformly enthusiastic. Moreover, all knowledgeable scientists would
              be expected to be attending the meeting and would therefore be in conflict.
              Thus, as allowed by 122.1-C3(b) in the GPG the proposal was not peer reviewed
              prior to this recommendation for support. It should be noted that several
              Programs have contributed to the overall support of this conference: Plant
              Genomics (DBI), Genetics (MCB), Population Biology (DEB), Developmental Biology
              (IBN) and Integrative Plant Biology (IBN). Support is enthusiastically
              recommended.
