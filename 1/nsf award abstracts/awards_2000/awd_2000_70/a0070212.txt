Texas A&M University (TAMU) will operate the R/V Gyre during
              2000 as a general oceanographic research vessel in support of NSF-supported
              research projects.  The Gyre is a 182 ft. vessel, constructed in 1973 and
              modified in 1980 and 1984, and owned and operated by TAMU.  The vessel is
              scheduled for a total of 175 operational days during 2000, of which 10 days are
              in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining cruises will support
              State, Navy, Minerals Management Service, and other Federal and private
              projects.  The projects scheduled on the Gyre include several oceanographic
              disciplines and will fully utilize the capabilities of the vessel.  The Gyre
              will begin the year in the shipyard for annual ABS inspection and
              certification.  All operations will take place regionally in the Gulf of
              Mexico.

The Gyre is part of a fleet of ships used by the National Science
              Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most oceanographic projects
              require highly specialized equipment to be permanently installed on the vessel,
              thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These vessels do not operate in the
              same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the
              operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to oceanographic
              research that are operated by universities and institutions around the
              country.
