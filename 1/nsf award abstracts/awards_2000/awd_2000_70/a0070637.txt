Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) will
              operate the R/V Pelican during 2000 as a general oceanographic research vessel
              in support of NSF-supported research projects.  The Pelican is a 105 ft.
              vessel, constructed in 1985, and owned and operated by LUMCON.  The vessel is
              scheduled for a total of 244 operational days during 2000, of which 56 days are
              in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining cruises will support
              NOAA, Navy, other federal agency and private projects.  The projects scheduled
              on the Pelican represent several oceanographic disciplines, such as biological
              and physical oceanography, and will fully utilize the capabilities of the
              vessel.  Operations will take place regionally in the Gulf of Mexico.
              

Changes in personnel in late 1998 seem to be working well.  2000 rollover
              funds were available as a result of scientists needing fewer number of cruise
              days.  The major refit plan for the pelican will be postponed since funds from
              Louisiana State were not allocated.  The refit will either take place in late
              2000 or more likely 2001.  In 1998-99 the majority of the MOSA account was
              spent, however no major overhaul costs are planned for 2000.  The University is
              instituting in indirect cost rate on TDC.

The Pelican is part of a fleet of
              ships used by the National Science Foundation in support of marine science
              research.  Most oceanographic projects require highly specialized equipment to
              be permanently installed on the vessel, thus the necessity for specialized
              ships.  These vessels do not operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing
              vessels.  As a result, NSF supports the operation of a variety of ships
              specifically dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by
              universities and institutions around the country.
