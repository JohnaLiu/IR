Abstract    :
                 This proposal consists of two parts.  The first is concerned with the
study
              of residual intersections and linkage of ideals.  The second is
the
              investigation of the various associated blowing-up rings.  The 
underlying
              theme is to explore connections between the two areas. 
The investigator
              studies the Cohen-Macaulayness of symmetric algebras, 
and the normality and
              the nature of the defining equations of Rees algebras,
by utilizing the
              methods of residual intersections.    

   This project in commutative
              algebra is motivated by closely related 
problems in algebraic geometry.  The
              process of blowing-up being a fundamental
tool in study of the singularities
              of algebraic varieties, our research
of the corresponding algebraic problems
              will hopefully yield more insight into
the geometry.
