Abstract    :
              Abstract: The investigator studies two areas in graph theory: (1) Graphic Ramsey
              Theory, and (2) Structural Graph Theory.  The basic goal of this proposal is to
              work on problems surrounding three conjectures:  the Moon-Moser conjecture on
              circumferences of a 3-connected planar graph, the Chvatal Toughness conjecture,
              and the Burr-Erdos Ramsey Linear Bound conjecture.

Graph theory is a
              relative new branch of mathematics that has applications in many areas, such as
              computer science, telecommunications, and transportation.  The problems
              described are major problems in graph theory.  In addition to their theoretic
              significance, many of the questions addressed here are of interest for computer
              scientists.
