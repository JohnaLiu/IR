Abstract    :
              Research will focus on systematic understanding and characterization
of the
              instrumentation of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave
Observatory
              (LIGO). In addition to providing leadership of the 
LIGO Scientific
              Collaboration's (LSC) Detector Characterization
Group, the Michigan group will
              carry out research in the following
areas: quantitative interferometer
              performance characterization,
analysis of instrumental transient signatures,
              development and
implementation of alternative interferometer control
              schemes,
and discrimination of instrumental artifacts from true
              periodic
sources of gravitational radiation.

Systematic detector
              characterization is necessary to the success
of the LIGO Project, a search for
              gravitational radiation from
astrophysical sources. The discovery of
              gravitational waves will
open up an entirely new and unique window
              complementary to the
electromagnetic spectrum for studying the most violent
              processes
in the universe. It will be possible to use this new spectrum
to
              study the formation of black holes from neutron star collisions,
supernovae
              explosions, and the rotational dynamics of neutron stars.
In order to carry
              out these studies and to exclude false signals, it 
is necessary to understand
              the sensitivity and noise levels of the 
interferometer detectors in fine
              detail. The research to be
carried out under this award in the next three
              years will be 
important at this critical development phase of gravitational
              
wave astrophysics.
