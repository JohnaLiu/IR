Digital
              Government:  Social Processes and Content in Intelink On-Line Chat Data

This
              grant will develop a proof of concept that chat server logs can map distributed
              knowledge content to underlying social processes.  Intelink is a cross-agency
              office in the intelligence community which has been maintaining complete
              records of chat sessions for several years.  For this seed grant, only a subset
              of records will be used and methodologies will be explored but not fully
              applied, including social network analysis and content clustering and
              visualization.  Also supported will be a workshop to introduce various Federal
              agencies to the techniques used and the results of the work.
