Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the work of Dr. Gary B. Schuster at Georgia Institute of Technology in
              Atlanta.   The research aims to extend earlier work on electron conduction in
              DNA, with the idea of understanding the details of the conduction process.  
              Oxidation of DNA, with removal of an electron as a first step, followed by
              electron migration to the initial radical cation to give a guanine (G) radical
              cation, and eventual DNA strand cleavage at a G site,  is a major source of
              genetic damage, and can lead in some cases to cancer causing mutations or cell
              death.

The proposed research will focus on testing various aspects of the
              phonon-assisted polaron-hopping mechanism of electron motion.   In this model,
              the oxidation of a base in the DNA initiates a structural distortion as the
              chain contorts to delocalize the initial radical cation over adjacent base
              pairs.   The delocalized radical cation is called a polaron. Polarons are
              thought to migrate along the DNA like a compression moves through a spring, as
              base pairs adjacent to the polaron join it and others leave as a consequence of
              thermal motion (phonons), while electrons hop from base to base.   Trapping of
              the polaron by water leads to the chemical damage of the DNA.   Students who
              participate in this research will learn a number of experimental techniques;
              the learning will be enhanced by collaborations with other scientists with
              special instrumentation and expertise.
