Abstract    :
              This research continues theoretical and computational studies of highly excited
              atoms.  These so called hollow atoms have been a recent focus of experimental
              interest at a number of synchrotron sources.  In addtion, there will be
              extensions of the methodology to treat multi-photon processes in intense laser
              fields.
