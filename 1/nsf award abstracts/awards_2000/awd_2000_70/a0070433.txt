Abstract    :
                   The principal investigator will apply tools from arithmetic 
geometry to
              study invariants attached to the actions of finite 
groups on schemes.   These
              invariants are Euler characteristics
associated to different kinds of
              cohomology.  Methods
of computing these Euler characteristics will be
              studied,
along with their connection to L-series,  Arakelov theory
and the
              theory of motives.   The principal investigator
will also work on two other
              projects.  These are to
complete earlier research relating capacity theory
to
              arithmetic intersections theory, and to study
the universal deformation rings
              of representations
of finite groups and their applications to Galois
              theory.

    This proposal concerns using geometric ideas to study
the
              solutions of systems of algebraic equations.  In geometry,
it is often useful
              to consider the symmetries of an object,
which are the ways the object can be
              rotated or flipped
back onto itself.  Another geometric idea, which goes
              back
to the mathematician Euler, is that one can attach certain
numbers
              ("Euler characteristics") to objects.  These
numbers provide a measure of
              complexity, and in simple
cases they count various natural features, such
as
              the number of holes in the object.  The current proposal
has to do with
              studying the symmetries of systems
of equations, and how one can assign
              natural Euler characteristic
numbers to them.  The goal of this is to carry
              over to algebra
some of the insights gained in geometry from
              considering
symmetries and Euler characteristics.  Systems of equations
arise
              from many different mathematical applications.
Euler numbers and symmetries
              can in many cases be used
to either rule out or count the number of
              particular
kinds of solutions to such equations.
