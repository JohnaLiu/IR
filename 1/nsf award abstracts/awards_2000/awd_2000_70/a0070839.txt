Abstract    :
              Dr. Ulmer proposes three projects in arithmetical algebraic
geometry,
related
              to Galois representations, modular forms, and
elliptic curves,
both over
              number fields and over function fields.  The first
project
proposed is to
              study the reduction modulo a prime p of
certain
representations of the Galois
              group of the p-adic numbers,
using the
recent work of Colmez and Fontaine on
              p-adic Hodge theory. 
In the
second project, Dr. Ulmer has constructed a
              subgroup of the
local
points at suitable places on an elliptic curve over
              a
function field; this subgroup contains the global points. 
He proposes to
              use these local
points to study the conjecture of Birch and
              Swinnerton-Dyer
for
elliptic curves over function fields.  The third project
              Dr.
Ulmer
proposes is to study a new class of problems in the
cohomology
              of
varieties which are inspired by classical non-vanishing
results
              for
L-series.  The new questions come by reinterpreting
vanishing
              results
using Grothendieck's analysis of L-functions and lead
              to
purely
geometric questions.  In some instances these questions can
be
              treated
using monodromy results of Katz and Sarnak.

This proposal falls
              into the general area of arithmetical
algebraic
geometry - a subject that
              blends two of the oldest areas of
mathematics: number theory and geometry. 
              This combination
has proved
extraordinarily fruitful, having recently solved
              problems
that
withstood the efforts of generations.  Among its
              many
consequences are
new error correcting codes which are used in
              computer
storage devices
like compact disks and hard drives and secure
              information
transmission
schemes which are used for financial transactions on
              the
internet.
