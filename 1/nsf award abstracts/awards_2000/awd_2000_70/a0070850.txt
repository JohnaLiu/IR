              Abstract for NSF 0070850--Raskind, Geisser, and Scharaschkin

The
              investigators will study the arithmetic and K-theory of algebraic varieties
              over fields of arithmetic type, such as algebraic number fields.  They will
              introduce methods to describe the rational points on a wide class of algebraic
              varieties over number fields.  One of the basic tools used to study these
              questions is motivic cohomology, which Geisser and Raskind will continue to
              develop.

The theory of systems of polynomial equations with rational
              coefficients is important for questions in cryptography and coding theory. 
              Knowing a lot about the solvability of such a system of equations, or lack
              thereof, can play a big role in developing or breaking  cryptosystems and
              codes.  The proposers will use the latest techniques in number theory and
              algebraic geometry to study these questions.  Although these are very old
              subjects, they have found spectacular applications in recent times, which has
              helped spur their theoretical development.
