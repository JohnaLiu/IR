Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical physics will focus on questions in elementary particle
              physics and astrophysics.  The physical, astrophysical, and cosmological
              consequences of theories in which space has more than three
dimensions will be
              explored.  Ramifications of "duality relations" demonstrating that seemingly
              different string theories are actually different forms of the same theory will
              be studied.  Small effects that will test our present understanding of the
              forces between the elementary particles and possibly signal the presence of new
              physics beyond our present understanding will be theoretically analyzed.  The
              possibility that space has more than three dimensions is extremely interesting,
              and the exploration of its consequences is very important. String theory is the
              leading candidate for a theory that unifies our understanding of all the basic
              forces of nature, so further progress in this theory is important as well. 
              Finally, small effects have been a fruitful testing ground for our
              understanding of physics in the recent past, so new analyses of such effects is
              very timely.
