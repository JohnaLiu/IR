Abstract    :
              
The purpose of this work is to demonstrate and evaluate two device concepts
              incorporating
ferroelectric polymer Langmuir-Blodgett films: high-performance
              capacitors and
nonvolatile data storage elements. Both device concepts take
              advantage of unique
dielectric and ferroelectric properties of
              Langmuir-Blodgett films of polyvinylidene
fluoride and its copolymers. The
              high-performance capacitors benefit from the record
dielectric strength of
              over 3 GV/m in the highly uniform films as thin as 1 nm. The energy
storage
              density of multilayer capacitors made from the ferroelectric polymer LB films
              is
expected to reach 200 to 1000 Joules per cubic centimeter. The fast switch
              speed of 2
microseconds and the ability to deposit the films on a variety of
              substrates permits the
fabrication of inexpensive of hybrid nonvolatile data
              storage devices composed of a
ferroelectric polymer LB film deposited directly
              on an array of planar field-effect
transistor. Though each device concept may
              independently prove suitable for practical
application, they may prove
              particularly useful together in combination with conventional
integrated
              circuits for the production of nonvolatile random-access memories, caches,
              and
archival storage. This project is a natural spin-off of five years of
              study and
development of the only reported two-dimensional ferroelectrics,
              research conducted
jointly by the PI's group in collaboration with two groups
              at the Institute of
Crystallography in Moscow.
