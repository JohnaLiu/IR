Abstract    :
              A conference on solid films and surfaces will be held at Princeton University on
              July 9-13, 2000. Solid films and surfaces, and interfaces are a common feature
              of technologically important materials and activities, including the
              fabrication of electronic and optoelectronic devices, and sensors. This
              conference provides a forum for the presentation and discussion of the latest
              experimental and theoretical advances in the field. It is organized as a
              multiple session conference lasting four days, with plenary talks summarizing
              recent work in various sub-fields. In addition, invited talks, contributed
              talks and poster sessions are organized. 
The program emphasizes the topics:
              Structural, electronic and optical properties of thin films and surfaces; Thin
              film growth and related topics, such as epitaxy and roughening; Organic
              monolayers and films; Wide band gap semiconductor surfaces and interfaces;
              Nanostructured thin films; Oxidation, oxide films and surfaces; New
              characterization techniques; Thin films for solar cells; Theory of films and
              surfaces. 
%%%
 An evaluation of the progress and status of solid films and
              surfaces, and interfaces along with current assessments of the most important
              developments in this field will be of great value to the understanding of
              surface chemistry and enhanced utilization of electronic/photonic materials in
              computing, data processing, and communications. The conference is co-supported
              by the CHE/ASC propram.
