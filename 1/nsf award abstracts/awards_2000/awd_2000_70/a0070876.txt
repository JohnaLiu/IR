Abstract    :
              The subject of multibubble sonoluminescence, where numerous bubbles created by
              transient cavitation grow and then collapse emitting light and also causing
              chemical reaction, is modeled using smooth particle hydrodynamics and including
              19 chemical reactions of 9 chemical constituents.
