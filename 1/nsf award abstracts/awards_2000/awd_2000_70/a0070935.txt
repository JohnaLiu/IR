Abstract    :
              This research will analyze the evolution of those rapidly rotating
neutron
              stars that could be sources of persistent quasi-periodic
gravitational
              radiation. The initial focus will be on those neutron
stars that have been
              spun up via continued accretion from a stellar
companion. X-ray observations
              of such binary sources (such as those
carried out by the Rossi X-ray Timing
              Explorer satellite) will be
employed in order to identify promising targets. A
              parametrized model
of the system, which describes the evolution of those
              properties that
determine the gravitational wave frequency and amplitude, will
              be
developed.

The Stanford group has been identified by the Astrophysical
              Source
Identification and Signatures Subgroup of the LIGO
              Scientific
Collaboration to lead the effort to develop "robust algorithms"
              for
detection of such sources. Such algorithms produce
              parametrized
predictions of the time dependence of the gravitational
              radiation,
which greatly facilitate its detection by LIGO and other
              laser
interferometer detectors. This research is the first step toward
              this
goal.
