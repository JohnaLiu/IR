Abstract    :
              The investigator is pursuing two lines of research, relevant to the
general
              proof-theoretic program of extracting constructive, computational,
and
              combinatorial information from theories of classical mathematics. The
first
              involves extending a semantic approach to ordinal analysis to
Kripke-Platek
              set theory, and extracting combinatorial and computational
principles for the
              constructible hierarchy from the analysis. The second
involves trying to find
              sharp conservation results for weak theories of
nonstandard arithmetic,
              preferably via "natural" interpretations of the
nonstandard theories in the
              standard ones, and exploring ways in which
ordinary mathematics can be carried
              out in these frameworks.

Since the beginning of the 20th century, there has
              been a gradual
divergence between two different ways of thinking about
              mathematics. On
the one hand, mathematics is viewed as a general investigation
              into
abstract concepts, many of them involving infinitary objects
              and
structures. On the other hand, many see mathematics as grounded
              by
concrete symbolic representations and calculation. One goal of
              proof
theory is to reconcile these two viewpoints, by finding the
              concrete,
computational content that is hidden in general forms of
              abstract
mathematical reasoning. The investigator aims to apply
              proof-theoretic
methods to the study of theories of nonstandard analysis, and
              fragments of
set theory.
