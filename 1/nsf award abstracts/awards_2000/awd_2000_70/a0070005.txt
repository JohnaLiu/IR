Abstract    :
               Characterization of the thickness and mechanical properties of thin films and
              hard coatings is of vital importance in a wide range of areas such as
              microelectronic devices, machine tools, and engine components.  While
              conventional contact methods such as mechanical indentation are currently in
              vogue, laser ultrasonic (LU) methods offer several benefits including
              non-contact rapid operation, couplant independence, high fidelity, and the
              ability to perform in hostile environments. This project aims to:  

1.
              Develop theoretical models for laser generated ultrasound in multi-layered
              structures allowing for the calculation of time domain surface displacements;
              
2. Devise experimental procedures for efficient generation of ultrasound and
              implement an adaptive optical detection system capable of working with good
              sensitivity on rough and smooth coatings; and 
3. Validate the theoretical
              models with LU experiments on a range of technologically relevant multi-layered
              structures with a focus on transition metal nitrides and carbides (ie. TiN,
              TiC, ZrN, CrN);  

The goal of the project is to develop the next generation
              methodologies necessary for laser ultrasonic characterization of thickness and
              elastic moduli of thin films and coatings.
