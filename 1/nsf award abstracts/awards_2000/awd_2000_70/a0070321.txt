Quantitative Data Analysis
              and Graphics Facility: Storm 860 and Alpha Imagers 

This award will fund the
              development of an interdepartmental facility for documentation and
              quantification of biochemical and molecular biological data. This facility will
              provide equipment and software to digitize data derived from most gel
              electrophoresis experiments and allows analysis of the resulting data. The
              procedures and techniques that can be analyzed will include: DNA and RNA
              sequencing and structure analysis, PCR-based assays including quantitative PCR
              and RFLP analysis, quantitative northern and Western blotting, Southern
              hybridizations, non-radioactive detection for research and teaching
              laboratories, colony counting and kinetic analyses of enzymatic reactions. The
              goal is to maximize use by making the facility as flexible and as accessible as
              possible.

Equipment to be purchased includes two imagers capable of
              quantifying data imaged using autoradiography, fluorescent stains or labels,
              visible stains or labels, or simply using white lighting. These two components
              are the Storm 860 Imager (Molecular Dynamics) and the AlphaImager
              (AlphaInnotech). Sufficient computational equipment will be purchased to
              perform image and data analysis. The facility will be installed on the first
              floor of the centrally located Biochemistry building, which will provide easy
              access to researchers in several departments.  The facility will be used for
              undergraduate and graduate level training in quantifying and analyzing data
              collected from biological assays.
