Abstract    :
              Research will be done to establish the phenomenon of localization
for
              physically relevant models of disordered media where existing
methods have
              widely failed in the most relevant case of dimension
three. Particular models
              to be investigated are the
Bernoulli-Anderson model, the Poisson model, and
              the Random
Displacement model. The main obstacle to overcome is the lack
              of
monotonicity properties for these models, which causes
              significant
differences to the more successfully studied Anderson model.
              In
previous work, the PI and his collaborators have shown that
methods from
              scattering theory can be used to establish
localization for one-dimensional
              non-monotonic models. These
methods will lead to further results in one
              dimension and provide
new tools in higher dimension such as using the total
              scattering
cross section of single sites to identify energies where
              extended
states exist. Some related goals are to establish Wegner
              estimates
for the eigenvalues of finite box hamiltonians and Lifshitz
              tail
asymptotics for the integrated density of states in the above
models, as
              well as to understand the effects of correlations
arising from long range
              single site scatterers.

The mathematical theory of disordered media aims at
              understanding
the spectral and scattering theoretic properties of
              irregular
solids such as, for example, crystals with impurities,
              alloys,
materials with lattice deviations and amorphous media.
              Different
models of random operators are used to describe the various
              types
of disorder. This provides a mathematical framework to decide
              on
conductivity properties: If localization of states can be
shown, then the
              solid is electrically insulating, while the
existence of extended states
              characterizes a conducting material.
The PI's research aims at establishing
              these properties for models
of high physical relevance, which have so far
              resisted a rigorous
mathematical treatment. For example, localization
              properties are
not yet understood for realistic models of alloys. Ideas
              from
statistical physics and solid state physics will be combined
              with
methods from scattering theory, spectral theory and harmonic
analysis to
              make progress.
