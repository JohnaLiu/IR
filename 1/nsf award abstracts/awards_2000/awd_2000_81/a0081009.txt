Researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will
              build and test a small, solid state, low power, and cable-free orientation
              device using new magnetic sensor technology and newly available optical
              communications technology using blue LED (light-emitting diode) devices.  The
              orientation device would be used to determine the orientation of geological
              features on the seafloor in the same way that geologists use a Brunton compass
              to measure strike and dips of rock formations on land.  The proposed instrument
              will provide an order of magnitude improvement in seafloor orientation
              measurements, and it will demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of optical
              communications using blue LED technology in the deep-sea environment.
