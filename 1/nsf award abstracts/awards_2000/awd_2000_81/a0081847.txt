Abstract    :
              The last decade has witnessed a significant research thrust aimed at handling
              very large models in computer graphics. This project will extend those efforts
              by focusing on means to efficiently visualize, interact with, and manipulate
              large-scale graphics datasets over networks. The PI plans to develop techniques
              that will decrease latency, reduce bandwidth, and increase the interactivity
              for large graphics datasets over networks. The technical vision is to build a
              distributed rendering system that (a) takes advantage of the respective powers
              of image-based and object-based rendering for visualization of large-scale
              graphics datasets, (b)is well-suited for visualization-assisted collaboration
              and interaction across limited bandwidth links, and (c) takes into account the
              client, server, and network resources to deliver the best overall performance
              including times to transfer and render a dataset. Towards these ends the PI
              will explore techniques for high compression, progressive transmission,
              rendering from compressed data, handling time-varying datasets, and resource-
              aware rendering. The project work plan also seeks to develop tools for
              annotation, navigation, and sharing of educational spaces for use in
              synchronous and asynchronous learning environments that use three-dimensional
              datasets. This research will help push network-based collaborative design to
              the next level in a variety of science, engineering, and medical applications.
