This
              proposal plans to build on the results obtained by the PI in previous grants on
              the process of polymeric materials pulverization. In particular, it was shown
              that it is possible to use an extruder to submit a polymer to a program of
              stresses and temperature fluxes, resulting into a desirable product. Such are,
              for instance, the recycling of wasted tires or the creation of useful powders
              or coatings. This success, which included the successful deposition of several
              patents,  has generated an interest from a number of industrial organizations
              (Amoco, Dow, Dupont, etc). Future cooperation is being contemplated.
     The
              main goal of this proposal is to produce a model, which among other things,
              will be generic enough to include both laboratory and industrial scales. A
              detailed research plan includes three parts: experimental, theoretical and
              computational . A systematic series of tests will expand our current knowledge
              of particle production , pulverization, mechanical/chemical behavior, and waste
              stream/additive component interaction.  All these measurements will be the
              basis for a dependable assessment of the physical processes which lead to
              desirable materials . A reliable numerical  model should follow, including an
              optimizing procedure.
