Abstract    :
              Summary:  This ESH project will address the hypothesis that shifts of the
              westerly winds in the South Atlantic resulted in changes of primary production
              during the last glacial period.  A combined circulation and biogeochemical
              model will be developed, using 13N as one of the tracers for production. 
              Results of the model will first be compared against modern 13N distributions,
              and the model will then be applied to alternate climate scenarios for the last
              glacial using sedimentary 13N as test prodictions.
