ITR:  Intelligent
              Memory Architectures and Algorithms to Crack the Protein Folding
              Problem

This project is a multidisciplinary effort to design fundamentally
              improved algorithms, hardware, and software to solve the protein folding
              problem.  The project, which teams experts in hardware, software, and
              computational biology, promises advances in applications of protein folding
              such as drug design and understanding of diseases.  In addition, the project
              will investigate new hardware and software based on advancing IC technology. 
              The architecture under examination will use increased integration of processors
              and memory in a single chip, and software will take advantage of the proximity
              of memory and processing.  This work is tightly coupled to the IBM Blue Gene
              effort, but will investigate complementary issues.  In particular,
              simulation-based studies will investigate the use of next-generation
              intelligent architectures.
