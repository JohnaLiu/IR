Abstract    :
              Summary:  This ESH project will analyze alkenone unsaturation as a proxy for sea
              surface temperature in sediments from the Bermuda Rise at sample intervals of
              100 years for the last 450,000 years.  The goal is to construct a
              highly-resolved record of SST that can be compared with variations in the
              Vostok ice core to assess the timing and occurrence of rapid (millennial)
              variations and to serve as a reference section for North Atlantic variability
              comparable to the Greenland ice core record.
