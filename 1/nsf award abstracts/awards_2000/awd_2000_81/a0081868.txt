Abstract    :
              High velocity work environments such as medical trauma centers depend on robust
              and efficient coordination by team members to bring together appropriate
              knowledge and skills, or expertise. This project investigates the existing and
              potential role of information technology (IT) in expertise coordination in a
              type of high velocity, high outcome work environment: level-I trauma centers in
              this country.  A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods are used
              to collect observational and survey data in a range of trauma centers regarding
              the expertise needs of trauma medical teams, the points of expertise needs, the
              modes of acquiring needed expertise, the sources of information related to work
              and expertise coordination, and uses of IT for the coordination of needed
              expertise, as well as broader organizational variables. The project will
              contribute to the development of guiding principles in the design of next
              generation IT for high velocity work environments in the areas of user
              interfaces, coordination modes, and the evaluation of IT on coordination. It
              will contribute to the understanding of expertise coordination and how IT
              affects these processes.  Finally, the project will enhance an existing
              multi-disciplinary research program on information and coordination,
              particularly as it relates to issues in emergency trauma care.
