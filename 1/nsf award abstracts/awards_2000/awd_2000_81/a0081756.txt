Funds are provided for laboratory
              experiments in a rotating tank simulating the interaction of an oceanic eddy
              and a shelf break frontal current.  Oceanographically interesting subsets of
              parameter space will be investigated.  Stratification representing both summer
              and winter stratification on the Middle Atlantic Bight /New England shelf will
              be utilized.  The parameter space investigated will be the ratio of shelf jet
              current strength to eddy current strength and the ratio of shelf current width
              to Rossby radius of the eddy.  Emphasis will be placed on understanding the
              exchange of mass across the shelf break region.
