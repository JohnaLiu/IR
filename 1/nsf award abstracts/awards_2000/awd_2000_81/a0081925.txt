Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT
OPP-0081925

Small coastal communities in the North Atlantic have
              faced widespread unemployment, substantial outmigration, and closure of major
              social institutions since the collapse of the northern cod fishery in 1992. 
              This research project will (1) describe and analyze the fisher-families'
              perspectives of their changing situation and their conceptions of feasible
              responses to those changes; (3) compare these perspectives to actual social and
              economic processes affecting the communities; and (4) analyze the connections
              between perceptions and actual rapid changes.  By illuminating the range of
              community perspectives and responses, this research is designed to contribute
              to the development of co-management policies to address resource crises.
