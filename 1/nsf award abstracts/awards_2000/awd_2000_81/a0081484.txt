Status cues give clues
              to an individual's status characteristics and task abilities, and through the
              theoretical mechanism status generalization, have been shown to affect group
              structure and individual behavior.  This project investigates formal vocabulary
              as a potential status cue.  Preliminary results have shown that formal
              vocabulary does raise the performance expectations associated with an actor. 
              This research investigates how that effect may interact with other status
              characteristics; in particular, whether the enhancement produced by vocabulary
              can raise expectations for actors already possessing high status as much as for
              actors possessing low status.  Results will improve determinacy of theoretical
              explanations for effects of status cues, and will give some understanding of
              the applicability of this particular status cue in different kinds of social
              situations.
