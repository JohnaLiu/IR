ITR:  Toward Agile
              Information Networks:  Electro-Optic Frequency Shifter

A new type of optical
              frequency translator, under study and development in this project, can provide
              very rapid optical routing capability.  The device, known as an Electro-Optic
              Frequency Shifter  (EOFS) provides an all optical way to rapidly shift a
              bitstream from one optical channel to another in a high-bandwidth wavelength
              division multiplexed network.  The EOFS uses a traveling wave electro-optic
              interaction between a microwave control signal and the optical bit stream.  The
              microwave signal co-propagates with the optical bit stream through a LNO
              waveguide, and shifts frequency of the optical pulses via the linear
              electro-optic effect.

Tuning in this device is accomplished by changing the
              microwave power level, keeping the microwave frequency fixed.  All of the light
              is shifted in frequency, so there is no need to filter unshifted light.  A
              single-stage device should have a tuning range of over 2 THz, which would
              encompass many optical data channels.  Since there is no second optical source
              needed, there is no settling/control time required for tuning a second optical
              frequency;  the device can change frequency shifting as quickly as the
              amplitude of the microwave signal can be changed, which should be on the order
              of the inter-pulse time spacing.
