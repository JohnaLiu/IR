Abstract    :
              The East Pacific Rise (EPR) is currently our best-studied section of
              fast-spreading mid-ocean ridge, yielding a wealth of observational data and
              results spanning many scientific fields. However, this information has not yet
              been fully utilized. Most of it exists in noninteractive form (e.g. journal
              publications) or as incompatible datasets and models. To make the most of this
              data, scientists will need a wide range of sophisticated programming support to
              coordinate the use of data, computational tools, and numerical models across
              distributed networks of computers. This project will develop that
              support.

Technically, this project will develop the computational
              infrastructure needed to support data sharing, tool composition, and model
              coupling for the use of large scale, interdisciplinary data archives. It will
              then apply that infrastructure to build a domain-specific environment called
              the Virtual Research Vessel 1 (VRV-1). The VRV-1 will facilitate the use of
              data, maps, and models related to the EPR. The project will address fundamental
              issues of integrated middleware for scientific data management and
              computational science. In particular, it will support data sharing by merging
              three technologies: geographic information systems, database management
              systems, and electronic notebooks. It will support tool composition through an
              extension of an existing electronic notebook. Finally, it will support model
              coupling by developing support for exploring model correlations and
              relationships at a very high, domain-specific level in a fast prototyping
              environment.
