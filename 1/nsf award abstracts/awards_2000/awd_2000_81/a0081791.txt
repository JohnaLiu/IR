Abstract    :
              For large-scale simulation problems, experience shows that, despite the rapid
              evolution of microprocessor and parallel computing technology, only a small
              fraction of peak performance from high-performance computing systems is
              generally realized. This is so because there are typically critical mismatches
              between the architecture of high-performance computing systems and the
              fundamental structure of the target simulations. This is clearly a problem of
              critical importance to information technology. It represents both an
              opportunity and a challenge to the disciplines of system-level design,
              targeting special-purpose architectures for high-performance computing, and
              algorithm and data structure design for large-scale engineering and software
              applications. Accordingly, this project will investigate systematic
              methodologies for designing the systems and algorithms for high performance
              applications. On the system design side, the project will focus on specialized
              billion-transistor chip multiprocessor architectures and a hierarchically
              distributed organization of resources tailored to the needs of the application.
              On the algorithm and application side, it will focus on finite element
              simulation applications, including representative problems from semiconductor
              device design and coupled flow and heat transfer processes.
