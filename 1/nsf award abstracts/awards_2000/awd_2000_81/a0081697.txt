Abstract    :
              Summary:  This ESH project will analyze stable isotopes and Mg/Ca in planktic
              foraminifera from two sites in the equatorial Pacific to determine whether the
              early Pliocene was characterized by a permanent ENSO-like state with uniformly
              warm tropical temperatures and a shallow termocline.  A second hypothesis to be
              tested is that since the early Pliocene there has been a steepening of the
              thermocline and SST gradients from east to west, and that this steepening has
              allow the eastern equatorial Pacific to be more sensitive to orbital
              (insulation) forcing.
