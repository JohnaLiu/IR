By-pass transition,
              in which a laminar boundary layer becomes turbulent, without passing through
              the stages associated with a very low disturbance free stream, is a
              manifestation of subtle and technologically important physical phenomena.  The
              PI will use sophisticated numerical simulations to execute numerical
              experiments that will clarify the roles of the competing physical effects in
              by-pass transition.  It is expected that this work will have rather far
              reaching consequences for aerodynamics and turbomachinary.
