Abstract    :
              The vast majority of data used by scientists, engineers, and decision makers
              resides in a poorly structured collection of reports, memos, and other
              documents in a myriad of file formats.  The increasing densities and falling
              prices of storage devices make it practical to store for perpetuity all such
              data that crosses a scientist's electronic desktop.  The resulting Information
              History has the potential to serve as an intelligent assistant by detecting
              trends and patterns, suggesting potential collaborators, uncovering relevant
              documents and data from diverse sources, etc., resulting in dramatic increases
              in the effectiveness of information use. However, current technology, which
              focuses on either fully structured or completely unstructured databases, cannot
              be effectively adapted to extracting knowledge from a large historical
              semistructured database.  The goal of the proposed research is to develop
              suitable formulations of the knowledge discovery problem for historical
              semistructured databases and to develop, implement, and evaluate solutions. 
              The research thrusts are: (1) devising knowledge discovery operators for
              semistructured data and an algebra for them; (2) developing efficient methods
              for implementing these operators; (3) determining methods to incorporate
              structure incrementally and flexibly; and (4) incorporating differential
              processing.  A Personal Information History Assistant application serves as a
              test-bed for this research.
