Abstract    :
              This research focuses on the analysis of spatial interactions in distributed GIS
              environments. Data related to systems of spatial interactions includes spatial
              flows and locational and attribute data pertaining to origins and destinations.
              Given that these datasets are distributed across multiple nodes of a computer
              network, this research aims to: 1) study mechanisms of data partitioning and
              develop a metadata structure that describes the partition; 2) develop
              decomposable algorithms for gravity modeling that minimize communication cost;
              and 3) develop efficient algorithms for learning and classifying flow patterns
              using distributed data sources. The approach is to let the databases reside at
              their native sites. The algorithms dynamically decompose themselves into
              partial computations that are executed at individual database sites, and local
              results are composed to obtain the same global results that would have been
              obtained if the databases had been moved to a common site. The algorithms can
              find the decompositions to match the distribution of data across the network.
              This research will have significant impact on many problems that need to
              process distributed data. For example, it can enable GIS systems to analyze
              spatial-temporal datasets distributed over the Internet without having to move
              the databases to a common site.
