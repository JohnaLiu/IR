Abstract    :
              The proposed study aims to improve surface exposure dating using in-situ
              accumulation of cosmogenic isotopes by improving knowledge of the spatial
              variability of the cosmic-ray intensity with geomagnetic cutoff rigidity (a
              measure of geomagnetic intensity) and with elevation. The proposal is to
              conduct a survey of the neutron intensity at the rigidity greater than 17 GV
              and at altitudes up to 6 km. The work will be conducted in southeast Asia
              (probably in Thailand), the only location with rigidities above 17 GV. The
              proponents will measure the neutron intensity using a small aircraft flying at
              a constant altitude. The results will be used to determine the neutron
              attenuation length (the function that relates neutron intensity to elevation)
              for this rigidity. The value will then be used with their other survey results
              and with other published data to determine how the attenuation length varies
              with the cutoff rigidity (or with geomagnetic latitude). The final goal of the
              project will be the construction of improved formulations for scaling
              production rates of cosmogenic isotopes from one location to any other
              arbitrary location.
