ITR: Universal Access to Programming-- A Cross-Generational
              Learning
Community

Issues of lifelong learning can be addressed by informal
              education--
voluntary and self-directed learning activities taking place in
              diverse
settings (often outside traditional classrooms) that incorporate a
              variety
of learning methods and are motivated by intrinsic interests such
              as
curiosity, completion of a task itself, or social interaction. 
              The
voluntary and self-directed nature of these informal activities make
              them
ideal for reaching populations outside traditional education
              settings.
With respect to informal education on programming, modern visual
              simulation
environments have many features that make them appealing.  This
              research
will investigate the effectiveness of a state-of-the-art
              simulation
programming environment as support for informal education of a
              diverse
population of end-user programmers within the context of an
              ongoing
research project on community network infrastructure.  Key
              research
objectives include:

* Characterization of the programming literacy
              gained through visual
simulation programming and a determination of how this
              knowledge and its
accusation is mediated by the maturity and background of end
              users.

* Analysis of the role of the existing local community as a
              learning
community in building and maintaining the programming skills of end
              users
of varying ages and roles.

* Prototyping and evaluating a framework
              for cumulating and sharing the
artifacts and practices of end-user programming
              within the learning
community.
