Abstract    :
              At present, access to the information in large-scale text collections is largely
              limited to keyword-based searches which retrieve entire documents or passages. 
              While such tools are often satisfactory in retrieving information on general
              topics, they provide little support for accessing information involving
              specific relationships, events, or facts.

Information extraction technology
              offers the possibility of creating structured, tabular representations of
              selected relations from large text collections --- representations which can
              support more detailed document querying.  Until now, however, developing
              extraction systems for a broad range of relations has been too expensive and
              time-consuming to consider its use in this way.  Recent developments in
              extraction system customization offer the promise of substantially easing this
              task, and so making this approach to document indexing feasible.

This
              research project will: 1) use corpus-based techniques to automatically identify
              the most common relationships within a sublanguage (the set of texts concerning
              a particular subject matter), and the different ways in which these relations
              are expressed in the text; 2)construct systems to extract information about
              these relationships from new text, building tabular summaries; and 3) provide a
              user interface for querying these relationships and accessing the underlying
              documents.  Taken together, these tools should offer significant new
              capabilities for accessing the information in large text collections.
