Abstract    :
              This award is for a study of the isotopic composition of stalagmite specimens
              grown over the past 500,000 years in three caves in China: Buddha Cave south of
              Xian, Huanglong Cave in northwestern Hunan, and Fengyu Cave south of Guilin.
              The stalagmites will be dated by TIMS U-series methods to establish precise
              time frameworks upon which the variations of d18O and d13C are to be examined.
              In these stalagmites the long-term d18O variations provide the history of
              temperature changes, with lighter d18O values reflecting colder climate. The
              d13C record represents vegetation changes, such that warm and dry conditions
              reduce the C3 /C4 plant ratio, the density of vegetation, and the 13C
              fractionation for carboxylation in C3 plants, giving rise to heavier d13C
              values. From the isotopic measurements, the proponents will reconstruct records
              of the paleotemperature and paleomonsoon variability over the past 500 ka, at
              102 -103 year resolutions. The proponents will then compare them with the loess
              records from Central China and the marine oxygen isotope records, to
              investigate the response of the winter monsoon to global ice volume change.
