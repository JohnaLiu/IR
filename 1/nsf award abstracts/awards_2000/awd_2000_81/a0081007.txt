              ABSTRACT

OCE-0081007
 
Previous research by the PI showed that waters from
              the Sepik River on the northern coast of Papua New Guinea (PNG) had dissolved
              rare earth element (REE) compositions which are quite distinct from seawater. 
              When normalized against the REE composition of Coral Sea Composite, the river
              had enriched Sm, Eu and Gd concentrations.  This signature remained well
              developed in the estuary despite dilution of river water by seawater.  For this
              reason, the PI will analyze water samples collected from the Sepik River
              estuary to Manus Island along the track of the Pacific Equatorial Undercurrent
              (PEU) for REEs.  The primary objective for this research is to show that the
              REE signature and other lithogenic elements, especially Fe, in the PEU results
              from the transport of terrestrial material via island weathering and river
              inputs into undercurrents.
