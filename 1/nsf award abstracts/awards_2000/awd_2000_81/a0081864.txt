Abstract    :
              This award is to support a study that addresses the generation of the subsurface
              geothermal climate signature through the application of a specialized Land
              Surface Process (LSP) model, investigating the temperature coupling between the
              atmosphere and the solid earth with the LSP model previously developed to
              describe the upward-propagating microwave signal seen by satellites. Project
              members will investigate both the adequacy of this LSP model to generate the
              downward propagating temperature signal utilized by geothermal scientists for
              climate reconstructions, and the effects upon the temperature signal induced by
              changes in landcover or mean precipitation. They will also investigate the
              generation of the subsurface temperature field in a special setting: the
              prairie grasslands of the North American mid-continent. The investigators will
              test the model's performance with an abundant dataset of subsurface temperature
              profiles already available from Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Manitoba,
              Saskatchewan and Alberta.
