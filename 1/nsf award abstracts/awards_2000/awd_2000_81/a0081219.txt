Abstract    :
              The topic of trust and its influence on consumer behavior has received growing
              attention of late with respect to electronic commerce, especially with regard
              to establishing and evaluating the trustworthiness of a single web site.
              However, consumers who rely on the Internet for information gathering are
              better served by tools that integrate information from many different sources
              and measure the trustworthiness of the integrated body of information. We
              propose to develop a methodology that addresses this problem of assembling an
              information product from many sources and evaluating its trustworthiness.
              Drawing on techniques in text analysis, knowledge acquisition, graph theory and
              visualization, and statistical inference, we will enable the user to generate
              an automated summary from a group of web pages, evaluate its trustworthiness,
              and visually navigate the information models. The final deliverable is a
              software package that implements the methodology. The proposed research will
              benefit the Internet community by providing a new technology that fills the
              void left by current information retrieval and trust assessment technologies.
              In addition, the techniques we propose to develop have the potential to
              contribute to a wide variety of fields confronted with the problem of analyzing
              samples of graph-valued data.
