The processes of
              nucleation and crystallization are important in a number of industrial
              applications, including molecular self-assembly and synthesis of
              nanocrystalline materials where the role of long range forces between atoms and
              molecules dominates the evolution of the crystal structure.  The PI proposes to
              study, experimentally and theoretically, the crystallization of charged
              ("soft") colloids. The role of long range molecular forces within the
              parametric range of colloids will be investigated using tested measurement
              techniques (such as optical, neutron and X-Rays) and classical constitutive
              models as applicable.

The PI selected the nature of the colloid (e.g.
              monodisperse latex particles), its geometry, composition and suitability to the
              available beam techniques ("reciprocal-space").  An important section is
              devoted to data analysis and theoretical examination.  Such questions as the
              relative role of equilibrium thermodynamics and crystallization kinetics,
              crystal/liquid interface interaction, will be researched.
