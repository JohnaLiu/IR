Abstract    :
              This project will construct a combustion Oxygen demand instrument. The automated
              instrument will provide a relatively inexpensive analytical tool for the study
              of the amount of oxidizable material in marine sediments and will be used in
              studies of carbon sequestration in a variety of marine environments.
