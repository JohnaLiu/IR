ITR: Educating
              a Wireless Information Systems Workforce

The primary objective of this
              project is to develop and implement a
wireless information systems degree
              track that provides a unique education
in the development, design, and
              deployment of wireless information systems
with an emphasis on emerging
              wireless data technology.  The goal is to
produce information technology (IT)
              professionals with the knowledge to
address the special challenges (e.g. user
              mobility, adverse communications
channels, limited battery life) posed by
              emerging wireless information
systems.  A secondary objective is to develop
              innovative instructional
methods and tools using wireless devices in the
              classroom and laboratory
that extend through K-16 education.  The research and
              coursework associated
with this educational track are needed to help meet the
              explosive demand
for IT professionals from wireless service providers,
              wireless equipment
manufacturers, applications developers using wireless
              systems, and wireless
information systems users.
