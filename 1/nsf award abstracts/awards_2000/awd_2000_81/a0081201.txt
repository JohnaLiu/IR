Abstract    :
              This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award. Access to
              non-textual
material for persons with visual impairments has become
              increasingly important in recent years.  Tactile or haptic displays hold
              considerable advantages in term of non-textual information transfer,
              particularly for navigating in GUIs and in the transfer of graphic and
spatial
               information (plots, bar graphs, etc.).  This project will evaluate a new type
              of haptic display based on electrostatic stimulation (as opposed to the more
              common electrocutaneous or vibrotactile modes of stimulation).  Electrostatic
              displays have the potential to overcome many of the problems of
              electrocutaneous and vibrotactile displays.  Electrostatic displays can be
              easily batch fabricated using micro fabrication techniques, the percept is one
              of texture (there is negligible direct current flow into the skin) and there
              are no moving parts to stick or wear. The project will focus on the evaluation
              of the display for use in practical situations and will also lead to a better
              understanding of the perceptual mechanisms in electrostatic stimulation. 
              Specifically,
the work will focus in two areas: (1) evaluation of the display
              including learning effects, young vs. old, visually impaired vs. non-impaired,
              comparison to raised line drawings, pattern recognition, academic/business
              graphics and dynamic range, (2) development of improved display technology
              guided by continuous evaluation experiments.
