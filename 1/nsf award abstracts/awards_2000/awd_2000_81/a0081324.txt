Abstract    :
              This project will address the needs of researchers involved in solving large
              nonlinear problems, which exhibit multiple solution paths, or large-scale
              minimization problems with multiple local minima. It will develop a library of
              visualization and computational steering tools to address path following
              problems efficiently on Beowulf computer clusters. It will also provide tools
              for optimization of the cluster communication. It will produce tools that are
              integrated with the CUMULVS steering and visualization environment. The
              software libraries will be open source and provided to the community of
              researchers and users.
