Abstract    :
              This award is for a study of oxygen-isotope records from Ethiopian lakes.
              High-resolution multi-proxy paleoclimate records that have been calibrated
              against instrumental data are rare from the continental tropics. A group of
              crater lakes in Ethiopia present an unusually favorable combination of
              accessible and inter-comparable study sites with laminated carbonate-rich
              sediments, and long instrumental records of climate, hydrology and limnology.
              This project will use oxygen-isotope records from the lacustrine carbonates,
              calibrated against instrumental data and compared to model simulations and
              other paleoclimate proxies, to document climate variability at the study site
              at decadal to century timescales over the last 2000 years.
