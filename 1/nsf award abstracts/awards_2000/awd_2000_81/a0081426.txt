Abstract    :
              Particular protocols and mechanisms (e.g., "cookies," "finger" commands, the
              design of message headers), as embedded in commonly used information
              technologies such as the Internet, have the ability to affect experiences in
              online environments and to regulate behavior.  A series of historical case
              studies will be conducted to understand how the use of these mechanisms can
              have social consequences. These case studies will encompass the historical
              development of the Internet as well as the ways in which social values such as
              free speech, privacy, and intellectual property rights have intersected these
              developments. Documentary methods and qualitative interviews will be used. The
              results of these case studies will allow a better understanding of the
              processes that build norms, customs, and consensus in online environments.
              Further, this research will aid in the development of theoretical models to
              assist policy makers in understanding how sensitivity to the design of IT (and
              its various mechanisms, protocols, etc.) may be an alternative to formulating
              new laws and regulations to achieve positive social outcomes from new
              information technologies. Finally, this research addresses the relationship
              between the commercialization and privatization of the Internet and our
              established constitutional and social values.
