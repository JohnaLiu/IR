Abstract    :
              This SGER project will explore a unique approach to creating long-range ordered
              arrays of self-assembled, three-dimensional (3D) quantum dot islands. The
              concept being explored in this project is that with nucleation-less islanding,
              periodic arrays of uniformly sized QD islands may form spontaneously under
              suitable conditions-or may be induced by 'weakly invasive' growth modifiers
              that promote and enhance existing ordering forces. The research will use growth
              in an ultrahigh-vacuum system and post-growth, in-situ scanning tunneling
              microscopy to explore aspects of QD island formation. Epitaxial SiGe alloys on
              Si(100) will serve as a model system. A range of growth parameters in which
              islands form without 3D nucleation will be sought. The surface morphology
              evolution at early stages of heteroepitaxy (before islands with discrete facets
              form) will be studied to detect possible driving forces for spontaneous
              self-organization of QD islands into periodic arrays. Additionally, transient
              straining of the substrate surface by an optical interference pattern as a way
              of enhancing these driving forces to impose long-range order will be explored.

This project will explore a new and innovative approach to creating
              long-range ordered arrays of self-assembled, three-dimensional (3D) quantum dot
              islands.  The idea being explored involves nucleation-less islanding, whereby
              periodic arrays of uniformly sized QD islands may form spontaneously under
              suitable conditions. The project sets specific goals and methods for an initial
              study to test these ideas, and several key issues can be appropriately
              addressed and resolved by the project.
