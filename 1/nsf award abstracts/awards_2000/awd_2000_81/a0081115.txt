Abstract    :
              This award is for a systematic reconstruction of a high quality record of
              paleotemperatures and paleotemperature gradients over the last approximately
              70,000 years across Europe. The specific objectives of this research, a
              collaboration between McCoy at the University of Massachusetts and Oches at the
              University of South Florida, are 1) to measure the extent of amino acid
              racemization in fossil gastropod shells collected from loess localities ranging
              from northern France, across western and central Europe, and into the highly
              continental region of the eastern European loess plains; 2) to determine
              independent ages of the fossil shells or enclosing loess sediment using
              radiocarbon and luminescence dating methods; 3) to quantitatively estimate
              paleotemperatures and paleotemperature gradients for selected intervals of time
              through the last glacial cycle across the region based on the chronological
              data and amino acid racemization measurements in fossil gastropod shells; and
              4) to quantify the relationship between effective ground temperatures, which
              drive the racemization reaction, and surface air temperatures, which are
              critical data in the reconstruction of past changes in terrestrial climate.
