Funds are provided for the analysis and
              interpretation of archived data from the wind-driven boundary layer over
              Georges Bank.  These analyses will test the generality of recent findings
              concerning the dynamics of the boundary layer and extend them.  The study will
              address what causes the flatness of the Ekman spiral during summer conditions,
              how the boundary layer dynamics are modified in winter when the surface and
              bottom boundary layers overlap, and under what conditions a one-dimensional
              model of the coastal surface Ekman layer is an adequate representation of the
              dynamics.
