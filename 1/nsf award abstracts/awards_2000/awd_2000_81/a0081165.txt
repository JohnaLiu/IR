Abstract    :
              This award provides support for the U.S. contribution to a highly collaborative
              international scientific drilling expedition to collect new data to aid in
              understanding Earth's climate by recovering long cores from Lake Malawi. 
              Recovery of a long core from the southern end of the East African Rift Valley
              dating some 800,000 years into the Earth's past will be attempted with the use
              of the Global Lake Drilling 800 Drilling System (GLAD800).

The key
              scientific goals of the proposed research are to: 1) examine the response of
              the tropical terrestrial African climate to changes in low-latitude insolation
              and high-latitude ice volume orbital forcing, 2) determine if high-frequency
              climate variations are superimposed on glacial-interglacial variations in the
              form of wet/dry climate cycles, and 3) examine how inter-annual African climate
              variability may have changed as a result of longer-term climate
              variations.

If the researchers are successful, the resulting research will
              move the field of global change research forward by providing a high-resolution
              terrestrial record of tropical climate in a key climatic region.  The proposed
              collaboration with scientific colleagues from Europe and Africa, as both
              intellectual and financial partners, greatly enhances the potential for success
              of this endeavor.  The lessons learned from drilling in Lake Malawi will
              provide information as to the utility and practicality of using a mobile
              drilling system such as the GLAD800 as a tool for paleoclimatic research.
