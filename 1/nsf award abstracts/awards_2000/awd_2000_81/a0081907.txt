This project examines
              attributional biases in two cultures, China (a collectivist culture) and the
              U.S. (an individualistic culture).  Previous research has shown that tendencies
              to attribute behavior to individual traits rather than to external
              circumstances differ by cultural norms.  Thus it would be reasonable to presume
              that "internal" attributions would be more likely in the U.S. than in China. 
              Project participants will be asked to read several accounts of situational
              behavior, and then to explain why certain acts occurred.  Responses will be
              scored for individual vs. situational attributions, with particular emphasis on
              understanding tendencies to attribute hostile intentions.  Results will improve
              theoretical understanding of attributional tendencies, and may help understand
              cultural differences in tendencies to infer hostile personality traits in
              different situations.
