Abstract    :
              This award is for a study to provide the first "snapshot" of past tropical
              cyclone activity during the Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Period. To
              accomplish this goal, the investigators will collect several speleothems from a
              site in Jamaica. They will then perform 210Pb dating to supplement annual band
              counting and unambiguously determine the year of deposition of each speleothem
              layer. Stable isotopic analyses will be conducted at weekly intervals (20
              micron resolution, sufficient resolution for detecting individual storms) on
              the selected speleothem for three decades in the late 20th century. The
              speleothem record of tropical cyclone events thus generated will be calibrated
              and assessed by comparison to the historical storm record for that location.
              Finally, the investigators will apply the proxy method to detect tropical
              storms and hurricanes during the Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Period (using
              the same speleothem), and thus determine the relation between climate (i.e. sea
              surface temperature) and storm frequency.
