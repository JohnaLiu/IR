Abstract    :
              This award is for a collaborative research project to drill and core
              approximately 300 m of sediments at each of two sites in Lake Titicaca
              (Bolivia/Peru) with the primary objective of reconstructing a 0.5 million year
              history of climatic change in tropical South America.  Lake Titicaca provides a
              unique opportunity to study a continuous record of past climate in tropical
              South America.  It has a long, rapidly accumulating sediment record in its deep
              basins.  Changes in lake level are well correlated with precipitation amounts
              (and temperature) in the Amazon basin, and tropical sea-surface temperatures in
              the adjacent equatorial Atlantic.  Modern Lake Titicaca is a nearly closed
              basin, so that the studies of lake level, chemical composition, and biota are
              particularly indicative of changes in the amount of precipitation and the
              precipitation/evaporation ratio.
