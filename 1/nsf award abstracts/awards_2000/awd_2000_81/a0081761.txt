ITR: On a
              Virtual Laboratory for Network Engineering Educational Programs

The primary
              objective of this proposed research is to investigate issues
involved in
              building a virtual laboratory for network engineering
educational programs. 
              Different from a conventional teaching laboratory,
the proposed virtual
              laboratory will not require students to physically
present in the laboratory
              rooms, rather they conduct their experiments via
remote network connections,
              such as the World Wide Web.  The intent is to
demonstrate that this kind of
              virtual laboratory facilitates the training
of IT workers in a significant
              way: it will reduce the cost, increase the
facility utilization, and improve
              the quality of IT courses that are
experiment-oriented.  This project will
              focus on addressing technical
challenges that are critical for successful
              implementation and operation of
such a virtual laboratory.  Configuration and
              scheduling techniques will be
studied that provide students with remote but
              real time access to the
equipment during their experiments.  These kinds of
              configurations must be
carried out in an efficient and flexible manner so that
              a large number of
students can do their experiments simultaneously.  Access
              control methods
will also be investigated that deal with the degree of control
              over network
components given to the user.  The efficacy of diverse access
              control
methods will be examined over a range of implemented exercises.  The
              aim is
to build a virtual laboratory that allows an instructor to choose
              the
interplay of operating system support, experiment semantics, and
              network
support to best suit the learning environment.
