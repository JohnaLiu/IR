Funds are provided for an
              experimental laboratory study of the dynamics of partially mixed flows driven
              by both salt and heat fluxes.  The study will perform a careful examination of
              the parameter space in which different states of such doubly-driven flows have
              been observed to exist and will determine the stability of these flow regimes
              within this space.  Supporting theory will be developed.  This information will
              be of significant value in studies of climate variability and estuarine
              circulation, as well as in the interpretation of paleo-oceanographic data
              sets.
