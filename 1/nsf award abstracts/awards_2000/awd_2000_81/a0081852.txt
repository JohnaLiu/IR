Abstract    :
              This award provides support for a study of the numerous tuff layers interbedded
              in the Early to Middle Green River Formation, which offer an opportunity to
              establish the most precise terrestrial geochronologic record of climate change
              available for any pre-Quaternary deposit. These sediments have been interpreted
              to reflect climate fluctuations ranging from annual varves, to 21,000 yr and
              100,000 yr astronomical cycles, to longer-term climate changes. In the absence
              of precise temporal control, however, these inferences have yet to be verified.
              The project is a cross-disciplinary investigation of the sedimentology,
              stratigraphy, and precise 40Ar/39Ar radioisotope chronology of the Wilkins Peak
              and Laney Members of the Green River Formation, aimed at documenting rates of
              sediment accumulation and the absolute timing of expansions of Lake Gosiute.
