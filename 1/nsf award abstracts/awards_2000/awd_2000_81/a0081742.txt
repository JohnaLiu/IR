Abstract    :
              The worldwide expansion of network access is driving an increase in interactions
              among people, among businesses, and between people and businesses.  Such
              interactions are the staple of major Internet uses such as electronic commerce
              and virtual communities.  Successful interaction relies heavily upon trust. 
              Whereas security seeks to prevent illegal actions, trust goes beyond security
              in seeking assurance of accountability (of intent and capability) even for
              legal actions.  However, figuring out whom to trust and to what extent is
              extremely difficult in an open networked environment such as the Internet. 
              This project will study distributed, scalable computational approaches for
              trust management taking into account the different forms in which trust is
              exhibited in networked environments.  Such approaches rely less on centralized
              authorities and more on community policing through reputation mechanisms.  This
              project will evaluate the approaches based on criteria such as how easily a
              given approach can be bootstrapped, how efficient it is in helping members find
              competent and good peers, and how immune it is to invasion by untrustworthy
              members.  This project will also study aggregate phenomena such as the
              emergence of subcommunities, linkages among subcommunities, and the sensitivity
              of a community to change in membership.
