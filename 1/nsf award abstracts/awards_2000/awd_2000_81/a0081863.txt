Abstract    :
              This award is for a study to retrieve, analyze and interpret isotopic and
              chemical proxy records of El Nino-Southern Oscillation events from speleothems
              in caves documented on the Island of Niue 
(19 degrees 00'S, 169 degrees 50'W)
              in the western tropical Pacific.  The study will focus on modern speleothem
              deposits and cave drip waters to characterize speleothem growth rates, their
              dating potential, their isotopic composition, and their relation to modern
              water and vegetation.
