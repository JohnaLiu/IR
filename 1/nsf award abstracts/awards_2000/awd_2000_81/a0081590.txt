Abstract    :
              Platform-Independent Computing, as popularized by Java, is a key
technology for
              developing and executing next generation software on
distributed and
              heterogeneous computing platforms. The current
state-of-the-art mobile-code
              system is built around the Java Virtual
Machine Language (JVML).
              Unfortunately, JVML does not support other
programming languages well and is
              notoriously inefficient, complex,
and hard to extend. This research focuses on
              developing a new
mobile-code infrastructure that eliminates all of these
              weaknesses.
The infrastructure will be based on the FLINT typed
              common
intermediate format (also developed by the PI) and will
              provide
support to multiple programming languages such as Java, ML, and C.
              The
research will investigate new techniques on building certifying
compiler,
              smaller virtual machine, and more extensible runtime system
for compiling and
              running the FLINT mobile code. The resulting
infrastructure will be made
              publicly available to support other
cutting-edge research on proof-carrying
              code and secure internet
programming.
