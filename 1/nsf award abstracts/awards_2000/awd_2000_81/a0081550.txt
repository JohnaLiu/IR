Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to determine how best to design computer
              systems for collecting 
data from (rather than providing data to) users.
              Government agencies might use such systems to gather the factual data used to
              calculate the unemployment rate or the Consumer Price Index. Three sets of
              laboratory experiments focus on actual and simulated desktop (i.e., keyboard
              and mouse entry) and speech survey interviewing systems. The first set of
              studies examines response accuracy and user satisfaction with systems that
              monitor users' speed of responding and speech patterns in order to diagnose
              when users misinterpret concepts in the survey questions and could use
              additional clarification. The second set of studies examines user response
              accuracy and satisfaction with interfaces that do (or do not) tailor this
              clarification through dialogue. The third set of studies contrasts interfaces
              that require users to educate themselves about how the questions should be
              interpreted with interfaces that engage users in dialogue to figure out the
              correct answer. The project uses the methods of experimental psychology to
              provide guidelines for future development of interfaces that collect
              information from users. This research could significantly improve the accuracy
              of data collected online by government agencies and others.
