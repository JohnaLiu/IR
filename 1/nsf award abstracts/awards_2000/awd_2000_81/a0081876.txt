Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a collaborative project (between University of
              Colorado, Bates College, and the Carnegie Institute of Washington) to study the
              impact of Pleistocene colonization of Australia by modern humans. The
              investigators hypothesize that human burning activities destabilized ecosystems
              across the interior such that a large segment of the dependent fauna became
              extinct, and that this ecosystem change ultimately led to reduced effective
              moisture over the interior. The study involves a tightly focussed field
              campaign to acquire primary collections, and a coordinated analytical program
              for these samples concentrating on their physical characteristics,
              geochronology, and carbon isotopes as a paleovegetation proxy. By evaluating
              whether unparalleled shifts in the diet of Genyornis occurred as extinction
              approached the investigators can test whether human predation (no expected
              dietary change) or ecosystem collapse (expected adjustment of diet to meet
              these changes) is the more probable extinction mechanism.
