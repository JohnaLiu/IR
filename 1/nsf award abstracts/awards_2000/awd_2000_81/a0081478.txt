Abstract    :
              This award is for support of a study to take advantage of the known and
              estimated patterns of present and past climate variables in eastern North
              America in developing dD (deuterium) values for selected biomarkers into a new
              proxy for climate measurements. The project will study how the hydrogen
              isotopic composition of individual biomarkers varies in lacustrine surface
              sediments and in sediment cores from seven well-studied sediment sites in
              eastern North America and Yucatan Peninsula. The investigators will also
              collect and analyze dD values of lake water and aquatic plants along transects
              of surface sediment sites.
