Abstract    :
              With the high levels of system-level integration for electrical systems
              available today, tools for simulation and test of complex mixed-technology
              systems are urgently needed. Circuit simulators such as Spice are not adequate
              for simulating large circuits due to large run times. Even behavioral level
              simulation is too slow for the large numbers of simulation runs needed to do
              simple things such as design centering and fault simulation. The key thrust of
              this research is to develop new simulation algorithms that significantly speed
              up the process of design and test of complex mixed-signal/mixed-technology
              systems. The algorithms will quickly assess the merits of mixed-technology
              system design perturbations. The key observation is that the impact of design
              perturbations on the relative performance of the designs can be assessed
              accurately by approximate simulation methods, rather than by expensive exact
              simulation. These techniques are expected to speed up evaluation of design
              transformations for optimization of complex systems and test optimization by
              three orders of magnitude.

The project has three specific goals. First, it
              will develop techniques for fast time and frequency domain approximate
              numerical simulation of mixed-technology systems. Second, it will develop
              algorithms for fast time and frequency domain approximate spatial simulation of
              mixed-technology systems by partitioning the system into blocks that can be
              simulated under "open-loop" conditions. Third, it will develop techniques for
              fast time and frequency domain approximate numerical and spatial simulation.
              The project will accomplish this by combining the first two techniques.
