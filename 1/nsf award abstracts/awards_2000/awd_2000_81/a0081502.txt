Abstract    :
              0081502 Schmitt
An extensive field experiment will be conducted in the area of
              the extensive thermohaline staircase in the western tropical Atlantic to
              investigate the role of double diffusion in subsurface water mass
              transformation. A purposeful tracer (Sulfur hexafluoride SF6) will be released
              into a layer near the middle of the staircase to obtain a robust 9-month
              measurement of vertical mixing and lateral dispersion. Surveys of fine- and
              microstructure with a profiling instrument will determine the dissipation rates
              of turbulent kinetic energy and thermal variance. Formulae for the relationship
              of these dissipation rates to vertical diffusivity depend dramatically on
              whether the source of energy for mixing is salt fingering or turbulence. This
              experiment will determine the relative contribution of these two sources to the
              vertical mixing of tracer, salt and heat. A moored CTD/Current profiler will be
              used to relate fine- and microstructure surveys to the long term tracer
              dispersion. The hope is that the work will lead to improved parameterizations
              of diapycnal mixing for general circulation and climate prediction models.
