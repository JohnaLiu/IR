ITR:  Quantum Computation with
              Trapped Polar Molecules
David DeMille

This project is developing the basis
              for a new technical approach to the design of a quantum computer, which can
              plausibly achieve several orders of magnitude improvement in number of
              operations performed before decoherence.  The quantum mechanical bits in this
              design consist of the electric dipole moments of diatomic molecules, which may
              be oriented either along or against an external electric field.  Coupling
              between bits for logical operations is established because the electric field
              created by each dipole influences the energy of its neighbors.  The molecular
              dipoles are trapped in a linear array formed by a standing-wave laser beam.  It
              is estimated that this design can lead to a quantum computer with 10,000
              qubits, which can perform 100,000 processor steps in the 1-10 seconds before
              decoherence.

This project will address two aspects of the development of
              this approach: a source of ultracold molecules, and demonstration of the
              couplings between polarized molecules.  The first stage of the work will be
              development of the source of molecules by simultaneously collecting Rb and Cs
              atoms in a magneto-optic trap, then photoassociating them to form ultracold
              RbCs molecules.  The second stage will demonstrate the possiblilty of coupling
              between molecules by measurement of molecular electric resonance frequencies as
              a function of density and applied electric field.  Once the effect has been
              observed the project will turn to the construction of an optical trap for the
              quantum computer.  Demonstrations of most of the technical elements necessary
              for the quantum computer will be possible within the period of this project.
