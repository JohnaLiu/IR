Abstract    :
              X-ray crystallography is a fundamental technique for determining the structure
              of proteins. However, the physics of this process means that information about
              the relative phases of the thousands of x-ray beams used in the process is
              lost. The recovery of phases is referred to as "phase retrieval." Essentially
              all modern algorithms for phase retrieval are iterative, including the
              well-known "Shake and Bake" algorithm. However, a general problem with
              iterative approaches is that the iterates are drawn to attractors that are not
              true solutions. This project will investigate a significantly different,
              non-iterative approach that does not share this drawback. If successful, the
              result will be a computing environment that will benefit a variety of
              disciplines that engage in phase retrieval.

The new algorithm exploits
              techniques in optimization theory that have never been used in phase retrieval
              before. One key idea is to use a different objective function from past
              approaches: the zero-frequency component, or "charge" Q. A key property of Q is
              linearity, which avoids the many local minima that stagnate iterative methods
              for other objective functions. In the language of optimization theory, the
              objective function Q permits a direct translation of the phase retrieval
              problem into a mixed-integer program (MIP). Decades of research on solving MIPs
              can thus be applied to solve difficult instances of phase retrieval encountered
              in crystallography.
