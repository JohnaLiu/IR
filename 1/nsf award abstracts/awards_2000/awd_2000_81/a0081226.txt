Abstract    :
              This award is for a study to test the use of diatom-inferred conductivity as a
              proxy for fluctuations in P - E (precipitation minus evapotranspiration) for
              lakes adjacent to the western portion of the Greenland Ice Sheet. If robust,
              the investigator will be able to reconstruct the Holocene hydrologic history of
              a coastal region of West Greenland at sub-century scale, which in turn can
              contribute to evaluating hydrologic influences on marine and terrestrial
              systems over this time frame. Evaluation of coarser scale changes in P - E
              during the Holocene will be made from geomorphic studies of paleoshorelines.
              The study will use biological and geochemical proxies in lake sediments to
              reconstruct Holocene environmental history of three local regions of West
              Greenland at sub-centennial scale.
