Abstract    :
              Summary:  This ESH award will support further development and application of the
              use of marine molluses to reconstruct annually-resolved estimates of water
              temperature.  Four directions are planned:  (1) evaluation of amino-acid dating
              method by comparison with 14C dates, to address varying reservoir age, (2)
              construct an annual record of 18O for the interval 1600-1880 Ad using
              cross-matching of growth bands from dated specimens, (3) assess ontogenetic
              effects on 18O by comparing the same time interval in specimens of different
              age and (4) explore utility of Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca to resolve temperature and
              salinity effects upon the oxygen record.
