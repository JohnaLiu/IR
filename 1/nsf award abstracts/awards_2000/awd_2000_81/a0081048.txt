Abstract    :
              The 11th International Conference on Arabidopsis Research will be held in
              Madison, Wisconsin June 24 through June 28, 2000.  Arabidopsis thaliana has
              been the subject of genetic study for many years.  However, during the last
              decade, the number of research laboratories using Arabidopsis as a model system
              has increased tremendously, and Arabidopsis is currently being used to study
              all aspects of plant biology.  The rapid rate of progress in Arabidopsis
              research, including the near completion of the genomic sequence, underscores
              the usefulness of holding a meeting every year.  These conferences provide an
              important opportunity for the Arabidopsis community to interact and exchange
              information.  The meeting will provide opportunities for both formal and
              informal exchanges of recent information through platform and poster
              presentations.  The meeting will open with an evening keynote address on the
              global impact of plant biology to be delivered by Richard Jefferson, the
              Executive Director of CAMBIA (Center for the Application of Molecular Biology
              to International Agriculture).  This will be followed by short updates from
              each of the NSF-funded Plant Genome groups.  Many of these groups are carrying
              out projects that impact the Arabidopsis community.  Each of the 17 platform
              sessions will consist of talks from two invited speakers followed by two short
              talks that have been chosen from the submitted poster abstracts.  A concerted
              effort has been made to invite junior investigators, including graduate
              students and postdocs, to give these talks.  Posters will be available for
              viewing during three formal sessions, and because the poster session will be
              adjacent to the lecture hall, it will be easy for participants to go back and
              forth between posters and lectures.
