Abstract    :
              This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award. This
              multi-disciplinary study will explore a novel approach based on 3D magnifying
              "lenses" to building improved highly interactive 3D interfaces to scientific
              and engineering data that allow users to easily interact at multiple scales and
              with multiple coordinate systems. To be effective it is necessary that
              interfaces to large data bases be highly interactive allowing users to "drill
              down" on demand to see detail as necessary, or to "zoom out" to get contextual
              information. The P1 will extend human spatial cognition theory to deal with
              common problems in interactive 3D visualization systems, and in particular to
              cover perceptual issues relating to eye-hand coordination in multi-scale
              environments using stereo and head tracking VR technologies to improve
              visualization and interaction. The PI will develop techniques to link views so
              that users do not become disoriented while interacting with data at different
              scales. A proof-of-concept prototype that enables scientists and engineers to
              monitor and control remotely operated vehicles or autonomous undersea vehicles
              will be used to conduct experimental user evaluations to provide feedback and
              measure success.
