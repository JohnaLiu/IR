              ABSTRACT

OCE-0081073

In this project, the principal investigators and his
              associates at the University of Miami will continue their ongoing research into
              the physical chemistry of iron and other dissolved substances in seawater.  
              They will especially concentrate on determining the solubility in seawater of
              the very important iron species ferric hydroxide -- believed to be of great
              importance in the regulation of bioavailable iron.   This work will also
              include an examination of the effects of natural organic ligands that can bind
              iron and this impact its chemical reactivity, solubility, and availability for
              utilization by marine organisms.  This work with iron will be a continuation of
              this investigator's longstanding basic research program into ionic interactions
              in seawater and the implications for chemical speciation, thermodynamic
              processes, and the rates of chemical reactions in seawater.
