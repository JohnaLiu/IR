              0081808  Linden/UCSD

A study will be made of the interaction of vortices in
              stratified 
rotating flows.  The study will consist of laboratory experiments
              
conducted on a rotating table.  Vortices will be generated by pumping 
flow
              in and out through the sides of the experimental tank in a number 
of
              different source/sink configurations.  Experiments will be made in 
tanks with
              cylindrical and annular geometries.  Sophisticated optical 
flow measurement
              techniques will be used to obtain flow velocities at 
a variety of depths. 
              The aim of the study is to build up an 
understanding of the rotationally
              dominated, large-scale turbulence 
prevalent in the ocean.  Interactions
              between individual vortices will 
be studied, together with the way in which
              multiple interactions 
between continuously forced vortices give rise to mean
              circulations.
