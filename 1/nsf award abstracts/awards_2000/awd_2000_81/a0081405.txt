Abstract    :
              In this project an integrated fault recovery system is developed that
quickly
              isolates faults in programmable digital components and
determines new device
              programming configurations to return them
to full functionality. After
              detection of a hardware fault in a digital
component such as a digital signal
              processor or a field-programmable
gate array, an attempt to recover from the
              fault is made at the local 
embedded system affected by the fault. If the
              local system is unable 
to complete the recovery effort, a
              computational-superior remote system
may be accessed via a local network to
              aid in the recovery effort.
In either case, the result of the recovery
              procedure is a new device
configuration (instruction sequence or configuration
              bitstream). This 
configuration allows the affected system to perform the same
              logical 
function as the original configuration while avoiding the detected
              
functional hardware fault.

The direct result of this work is a set of
              compilation techniques for
both DSPs and FPGAs that produce instruction and
              bitstream
configurations that avoid detected hardware faults.
These tools are
              directly integrated into a networked
environment through the use of TCP/IP
              transfer mechanisms built into
operating systems frequently used for
              scientific computing.
