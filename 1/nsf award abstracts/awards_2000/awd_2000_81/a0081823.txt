Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop new tools based on the notion of
              "discreet proof" for ensuring security of electronic-commerce transactions. 
              This type of proof is "discreet" in the sense that it reveals no more than is
              strictly necessary for the purposes of a given transaction.  Discreet proofs
              are useful in providing authenticity, confidentiality, anonymity,
              accountability, and other properties often needed to ensure security of a
              transaction.  For example, discreet proofs can be used to decouple the
              information in a medical database
regarding a patient's medical condition and
              treatment from the patient's identity, thereby protecting the patient's privacy
              while simultaneously providing accountability in the dispensing of drugs and
              facilitating the collection of aggregate data for socially desirable goals. 
              Constructing discreet proofs for a given application can be technically
              challenging.  Expected research results include i) software tools to automate
              the construction of discreet proofs; ii) specific proofs for frequently used
              cryptographic primitives in
E-commerce; iii) practical protocols based on
              discreet proofs for E-commerce applications.  Through its educational
              component, the project is expected to increase the pool of adequately trained
              personnel in the growing area of E-commerce.
