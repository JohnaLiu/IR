Abstract    :
              This award is for a collaborative project (between University of Arizona,
              Louisiana State University, and Academia Sinica, China) to use proven methods
              to provide the first systematic study of century-scale SW Asian Monsoon
              variability. The project will focus on Tibet, where earlier work has
              demonstrated strong monsoonal influences, and where the investigators know they
              can obtain well-dated lake sediment records characterized by century-scale
              variability. By comparing high resolution, multiproxy (sedimentologial,
              geochemical and paleoecological) records along a sensitive east-west climate
              gradient, they will be able to separate the regional (monsoonal) climate signal
              from site-specific environmental influences. Moreover, they will be able to
              discern if any observed monsoonal events are time-transgressive or not, and
              also be able to quantify the sensitivity and rate of response of three
              different important vegetation types to century-scale climate events.
