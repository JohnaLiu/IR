Abstract    :
              Summary:  This ESH project will develop a high-resolution record (100 year
              intervals) of surface and bottom water geochemistry in sediment samples from a
              site south of Iceland, spanning the last 65,000 years.  Th goal is to assess
              the timing and phase of events at this site compared to those reported for a
              site on the Iberian margin, where benthic events are inferred to have occurred
              before surface ones by about 500 years.  Comparison of the timing of events
              between surface and bottom water at both sites will test the hypothesis that
              rapid climate changes in the North Atlantic were driven by global changes in
              sea level resulting from melting ice sheets.
