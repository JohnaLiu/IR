              ABSTRACT

OCE-0081118

Nitrogen in the marine environment is cycled through
              a complex and imperfectly understood geochemical and microbiologically-mediated
              transformations, especially in suboxic waters -- the zone between regions of
              distinct oxygen availability on one hand and the complete absence of oxygen on
              the other.  While some oxidation-reduction reactions in the nitrogen cycle are
              certainly driven directly by microbial activity, there is evidence that
              geochemical linkages to the cycling of other redox-senstitive moieties (such as
              manganese) may also drive some of these nitrogen transformations.   In this
              study, researchers at the University of Washington, in collaboration with
              colleagues at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the Middle East
              Technical University in Turkey, will study the chemical reaction rates and
              microbiology of denitrification reactions in the suboxic regions of the Black
              Sea.   High-resolution measurements of nutrients, trace metals, and the key
              nitrogen species associated with nitrogen cycling under suboxic conditions
              would be made.   The Black Sea will offer an ideal study site for this work
              because the spatially extensive suboxic zone will permit the fine-scale
              measurements that would be difficult, if not impossible, in other marine areas,
               The project should lead to an improved understanding of both the geochemical
              and microbiological linkages of the nitrogen cycle in suboxic marine waters to
              the cycling of other redox-sensitive substances in the Black Sea and other
              marine environments.
