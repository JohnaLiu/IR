Abstract    :
              As design-for-test (DFT) research becomes mature, a deep understanding of the
              relationship among structural features and their mutual effects on testability
              is needed. Sequential loops are widely accepted as a significant testability
              problem that must be addressed by the DFT process. Reconvergent fanout is also
              known to be a problematic structure for testability, however its impact on test
              has not been thoroughly studied. This project will investigate the relationship
              between reconvergent fanout, sequential loop length, and aspects of testability
              including fault coverage, test application time, and test generation time. This
              understanding will enable the creation of new DFT approaches, which improve
              testability in a unified way, considering all structural features and their
              interactions.
