ITR: Interfaces for Supporting Over-The-Shoulder
              Learning

For many people, a key form of learning how to use software, for
              example,
is not by taking a training course, nor reading a manual or online
              help, or
experimenting with the software.  Instead they may lean over the
              shoulder
of a colleague at work and ask for help.  This
              over-the-shoulder-learning
(OTSL) is important to study to understand more
              about its relative
importance and the circumstances in which it is and is not
              successful.
Building on prior work studying informal collaborative help in
              libraries
and offices, the research will address how often OTSL occurs and
              its
significance as a way of learning, possible genres of OTSL, the
              evolution
of learning a software application over time, the resources people
              use to
support OTSL, barriers to OTSL as currently practiced, and the skills
              of
efficient help-giving and determining how these skills may best be
              taught.
This work will help determine the functionalities that have the
              greatest
potential for improving the effectiveness of OTSL and contribute
              to
fundamental research in user interface design and
              computer-supported
cooperative work and learning.
