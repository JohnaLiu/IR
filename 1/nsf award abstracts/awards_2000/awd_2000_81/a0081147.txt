Abstract    :
              Summary:  This ESH award will examine the seasonal flux of the planktic
              foraminifer N. pachyderma in sediment traps from the Pacific sector of the
              Southern Ocean to determine whether this species accurately represents surface
              water conditions or, as the PI hypothesizes, subsurface conditions caused by
              the presence of a shallow, very cold subsurface layer and intense density
              stratification.
