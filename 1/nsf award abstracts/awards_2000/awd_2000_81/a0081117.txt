ITR:
              Bugscope: An IT Test Bed for Sustaining Educational Outreach

In general, the
              scientific research community is enthusiastic about
supporting educational
              outreach efforts (e.g. remote access to scientific
instruments via the
              Internet) if they can be achieved with minimal impact
on the primary research
              mission of a research group.  The research proposed
here is the development of
              information technology (IT) to automate the
infrastructure, administration and
              data handling tasks necessary to support
remote instrumentation projects for
              K-16 education.  The goal is to develop
an IT infrastructure that can be
              readily adopted by other academic research
groups.  One result could be the
              incorporation of the remote use of
research grade scientific instrumentation
              as an integral part of teaching
within K-16 curricula with little time and
              effort from the research groups
supplying the scientific resources.  The
              outreach project, Bugscope, that
will serve as the focus of this work will be
              structured so that the
instrument, an environmental scanning electron
              microscope, is provided as a
resource while leaving the planning, execution
              and control of the
experiment in the hands of teachers and students.  Projects
              such as this
can provide benefits not only to the students involved but also
              have the
potential to provide the general public with better insight into the
              goals,
techniques and instrumentation used by scientists.
