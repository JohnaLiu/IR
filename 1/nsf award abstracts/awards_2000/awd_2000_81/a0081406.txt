Abstract    :
              To overcome the limitations of current development methods for embedded
              software, which include limited use of secure and type-safe languages and the
              lack of support for formal validation techniques, this work explores the use of
              the modern secure language Java coupled with light-weight formal methods to
              establish correctness.  It tailors the Java technology to fit the domain of
              embedded systems by placing restrictions on the Java subset, supporting
              provably correct-by-construction synthesis techniques for reactive control
              skeletons, and analysis techniques based on algorithmic as well as deductive
              formal verification techniques. A key goal is also to support advanced features
              such as dynamic software upgrades and process migration through safe
              implementation methods that are formally verified.  It develops a new set of
              model-checking and program analysis tools that are demonstrated on prototype
              hardware/software co-designs of embedded Java processors.
