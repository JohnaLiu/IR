Abstract    :
              0081031 / Reid

This is a continuing analysis of the mean circulation of the
              Indian 
Ocean using modern, WOCE-era observations.  The approach is one of
              
classical hydrographic and water mass analysis, computing relative
              
geostrophic velocities and then inferring absolute reference velocities
              
from tracer distributions.  Once the Indian Ocean circulation has been
              
mapped, it will be synthesized with the circulations already calculated 
for
              the Atlantic and the Pacific.
