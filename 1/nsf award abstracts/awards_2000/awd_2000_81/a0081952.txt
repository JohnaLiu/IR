Abstract    :
              With many communications applications, such as mobile computing, as well as in
              data storage, data compression is essential for large sets of digital
              information such as images, video, and multi-media. Adaptive methods that can
              in real time "learn" about the data to compress it well are the most powerful,
              but can have the drawback that a single error can propagate and corrupt all
              data to follow. Based on past work by the PI, this project will study error
              resilient communication protocols and adaptive real-time data compression where
              error propagation is essentially prevented. This new work is targeted at both
              lossless and lossy applications, including image and video compression. The
              project will consider how the proposed techniques can be implemented in a way
              consistent with existing video compression standards. It will study how these
              techniques can be combined with reversible variable length codes (used in the
              MPEG-4 standard) to improve recovery from a catastrophic error burst. Although
              reversible codes have been studied by a number of authors in the past, there is
              much that is not known about efficient optimal methods. The project will also
              investigate how the learning employed by error resilient adaptive compression
              methods can provide a filtering mechanism that can be used for fast browsing of
              large data over a noisy channel, a situation that is increasingly important.
              The work will include theoretical analysis, algorithms design, and experimental
              work.
