Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the work of Dr. Edward L. Clennan in the Department of Chemistry at
              the University of Wyoming in Laramie, Wyoming.   The work involves detailed
              studies of the reactions of singlet oxygen with organosulfur compounds in
              solution and with organosulfur compounds and olefins inside NaY zeolite
              containing methylene blue sensitizer.   The solution studies include
              examinations of the Foote reaction surface, intramolecular electron transfer in
              the hydroperoxy sulfonium ylide, its Pummerer rearrangement, and singlet oxygen
              induced epimerization of 1,3-dithianes.   The zeolite work will include
              experiments to explore the extent of positive charge buildup on the carbon
              framework of the substrate, and the mechanism of intrazeolite
              oxidation.

Sensitizers, such as methylene blue, in the presence of light,
              are able to convert normal triplet O2 into the excited singlet state, which is
              much more reactive toward organosulfur compounds and olefins.   Different
              products of these reactions are observed in zeolites - microporous aluminum
              silicate solids - because of steric constraints and the presence of positively
              charged ions inside the structure.   These studies are expected to improve our
              mechanistic understanding of oxidation reactions, lead to potentially improved
              synthetic methods for making useful compounds, and provide state-of-the-art
              training for developing scientists.
