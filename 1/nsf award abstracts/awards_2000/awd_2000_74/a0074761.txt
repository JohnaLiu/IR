The development of implantable sensors for detecting
              biomolecules such as important ions in physiological fluids has currently
              become the focus of increasing investigation. One major problem with common
              implantable sensors is their poor biocompatibility. The body recognizes these
              synthetic sensors as foreign substances and promotes undesirable adhesion of
              proteins to the surfaces. One potential solution to this problem is to
              introduce endothelial cells onto the sensor surface to increase its
              biocompatibility. Endothelial cells line the interior surface of blood vessels
              and form the interface between the vessel wall and the flowing blood.
              Consequently, they are not foreign to the body and the protein fouling will
              possibly be eliminated. The objective of this project is to attach human
              umbilical veins endothelial cells (HUVECs) to cellulose triacetate (CTA)
              membranes through receptor/ligand interactions for use as the basis for
              increased biocompatible ion--selective electrodes. Briefly, the CTA membrane
              will be covalently immobilized with cell-surface receptor recognition sequence
              Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). The endothelial cells will then be seeded on the modified CT
              A membrane surface and allowed to attach at 37 degrees Celsius in a humidified
              atmosphere of 5% CO2. The work will investigate the attachment and growth of
              the endothelial cells to the CTA membranes and test the analytical performance
              of these surface modified membrane electrodes. The ultimate goal of the work
              will be to optimize the transport of ions across the endothelial cell coated
              surface membrane and hence, optimize sensor response while maintaining
              biocompatibility.
