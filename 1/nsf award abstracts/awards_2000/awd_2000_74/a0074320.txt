Abstract    :
              The objective of this research in to understand complex flame-flow interactions
              that occur in laminar flames but have direct implications to premixed turbulent
              combustion, particularly in the flamelet regime.  Models simulating these
              systems are investigated using both asymptotic techniques and numerical
              methods.  In this work, two problems are considered.  In the first, the
              structure, dynamics, and extinction of premixed edge flames in mixtures
              containing gradients of temperature or concentration are investigated.  Because
              enthalpy variations affect the flame temperature and hence the rates of
              thermally sensitive chemical reactions, they influence fuel consumption, flame
              quenching, and emission of chemical pollutants; effects due to Lewis number,
              stoichiometry, and thermal expansion are also examined.  The second issue
              concerns flame propagation in Poiseuille flow in which flame propagation
              depends on the intensity and scale of  the underlying flow field.  Total
              burning rate, flame shape, and propagation speed are parameters of interest,
              especially under conditions in which flashback is suppressed in the absence or
              presence of heat losses.
