Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology
              for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Metabolic
              Biochemistry and is entitled "Integrated Studies of Biodegradation in
              Rhodococcus and Acinetobacter".  This research studies aerobic biodegradation
              of aromatic hydrocarbons in Rhodococcus sp. strain 19070 and Acinetobacter sp.
              strain ADP1 and may  facilitate the development of effective bioremediation
              strategies.  Rhodococcus is an environmentally important microorganism but is
              difficult to study because genetic techniques are not well developed for it;
              however, Acinetobacter can be used to overcome this difficulty.  Since the
              first step in environmental degradation of many pollutants is the cleavage of a
              benzene ring, the primary focus of this research is the purification and
              characterization of  the enzyme benzoate dioxygenase from Rhodococcus.  The
              biodegradative pathway is being elucidated using mutants and complementation
              studies.
