Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology
              for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Animal
              Developmental Mechanisms and is entitled "The role of the GacA/S Sensory System
              of the Marine Bacterium Vibrio fischeri During Symbiotic Association of the
              Bacterium with its Animal Host, the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid".   This research
              explores how the symbiotic bacterium, V. fischeri, regulates association with
              its squid host, Euprymna scolopes.  A sensory system, GacA/S which is involved
              in the virulence of pathogens, is experimentally mutated and the resulting
              symbiotic traits of the bacterium are assessed.  The mutant bacterium is
              evaluated for its ability to associate with and influence normal development of
              the squid.
