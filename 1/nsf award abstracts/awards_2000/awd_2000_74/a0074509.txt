Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              Population Biology and is entitled "A Comparative Phylogeographic Approach to
              Studying Biodiversity".  Evolutionary and geographical factors influencing
              patterns of amphibian biodiversity are investigated by analyzing, within three
              different genera (Ensatina, Taricha, and Batrochoseps), multiple codistributed
              species for phylogeographic concordance.  In addition, comparisons of current
              and historic population level processes across species provide strong
              inferences on factors impacting genetic divergence in zones of secondary
              contact.  By combining spatial and genetic information across multiple species
              and populations, a more thorough understanding of the forces affecting
              speciation and regional biodiversity will result.
