The objective of this project is to identify molecular
              determinants of left-right (LR) patterning in the branchial arches of the mouse
              embryo.  A mouse Fgf8 mutant that displays LR patterning defects will be used
              as a model system for evaluating the potential role of candidate genes. 
              Specifically, cDNAs will be identified that are uniquely expressed in left vs.
              right and Fgf8 mutant vs. wild-type murine branchial arches.  Expression
              domains of candidate genes will be evaluated in normal and Fgf8 mutant embryos
              to ensure their relevance to branchial arch development.  Unique cDNAs will
              then be cloned, sequenced, and identified by comparison with a gene bank
              database.  As a POWRE award, this project will provide a unique opportunity for
              the PI to obtain hands-on training in a laboratory that focuses on molecular
              mechanisms of heart development.  This experience will provide a solid
              foundation in the tools and skills of molecular biology and thereby allow the
              PI to change research focus, which will be critical to her career advancement
