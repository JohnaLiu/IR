POWRE: Integrating Natural
              Language Processing and Information Retrieval for Intelligent
              Text-Processing


This POWRE proposal, request funds for the PI to explore
              information retrieval as a new, but related direction of her research.  Her
              past work was in the area of natural language, understanding and intelligent
              text processing.  The PI also proposes a combination of readings and system
              implementation to solidify her knowledge of information retrieval techniques,
              while gaining a better grasp of existing results in the field, and to develop
              the necessary system-building experience.  As a result, she will concentrate on
              two topics that will leverage her existing research strengths in natural
              language processing. In particular she will investigate the integration of noun
              phrase conference resolution and shallow parsing for query-dependent text
              summarization.
