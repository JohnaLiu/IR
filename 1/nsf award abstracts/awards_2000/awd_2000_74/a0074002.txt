Upper mantle reflections beneath the
              northwestern British Isles are some of the best-known and most-studied examples
              of fine-scale heterogeneity within the mantle.  First observed on BIRPS marine
              deep seismic reflection profiles, these reflectors have subsequently been
              imaged and correlated on additional reflection and refraction profiles in the
              offshore area of northern and western Scotland, but have not been reliably
              traced beneath the mainland, although analysis of existing wide-angle
              reflection data suggest these reflectors do project beneath mainland Scotland. 
                The present study will address both the scientific potential of broadband
              imaging of fine-scale upper mantle structure as well as the tectonic
              significance of major mantle reflectors beneath the British Isles.  The project
              will support a 2-year deployment of a 25-station broadband seismic network in
              Scotland to perform the following tasks.  1)  Correlate the seismic signature
              of upper mantle reflectors on passive- and active-source records.  2) 
              Determine the regional extent of mantle reflectors beneath the Scottish
              mainland.  3)  Examine the geometric relationship of upper mantle reflectors
              with lithosphere-scale structures of Paleozoic age.  4)  Estimate the physical
              properties, including anisotropy, of these reflectors and their surrounding
              lithospheric mantle.  5)  Test the hypothesis that upper mantle structure is
              largely Cenozoic in age.  This effort will leverage NSF funds with existing
              support from the British NERC to the University of Bristol for phase I of the
              RUSH experiment.
