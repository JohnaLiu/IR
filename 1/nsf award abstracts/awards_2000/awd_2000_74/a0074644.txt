Germ cells are set aside from other types of cell early
              in development, and 
differentiate into functioning sperm and egg cells. To
              understand germ cell 
differentiation would be a major achievement in biology,
              and would provide 
important insights into infertility, contraception, human
              congenital 
diseases, germ line tumors, as well as the preservation of
              endangered 
species. The molecular basis of germ cell differentiation is
              beginning to 
be understood, due to major intellectual and technical advances.
              General 
mechanisms that unite both vertebrates and invertebrates are
              beginning to 
emerge.

Six topics have been chosen for platform
              presentations: The early germ 
line; regulation of germ cell gene expression;
              cell division in germ cells; 
sperm differentiation; oogenesis and egg
              polarity; fertilization and germ 
cell function. Each will be organized and
              co-chaired by two experts in the 
topic, who will invite half the speakers,
              and select the other half from 
submitted abstracts. Platform presentations
              from young 
scientists will be encouraged. The meeting will facilitate
              interactions between scientists who 
study different model systems, and
              different aspects of germ cell 
differentiation.

This meeting will provide
              a public forum for discussion of all aspects of 
germ cell research, from the
              primordial germ cell to the functioning 
gamete, in diverse model organisms.
              About 200 - 250 
participants from all over the world are expected to attend.
              There are no competing meetings that 
are so wide in scope.
