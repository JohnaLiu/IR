POWRE: Exploring
              Tangible Interfaces

The proposed research is a pilot study into the area of
              tangible user interfaces. Its broad goal is to prepare the PI to redirect her
              research efforts into this forward moving area.   The PI will be spending
              two-months at an industrial lab, A Mitsubishi Electrical Research Laboratory.  
               She will also formulate a small-scale flow-on research project in the area of
              tangible interfaces to pursue back at her home institution that will
              incorporate a graduate student.  The PI's second activity will be to design a
              new course on tangible user interfaces at her home institution.
