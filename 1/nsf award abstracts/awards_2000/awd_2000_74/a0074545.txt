The University of Washington will operate the R/Vs Thomas G.
              Thompson and Clifford A. Barnes during 2000 as a general oceanographic research
              vessels in support of NSF-supported research projects.

The Thompson is a 274
              ft. vessel, constructed in 1991, and is owned by the Office of Naval Research
              and is operated by The University of Washington.  The vessel is scheduled for a
              total of 223 operational days during 2000, of which 105 days are in support of
              NSF-supported investigators.  The remaining cruises will support NASA, ONR,
              NOAA, State and private projects.  The projects scheduled on the Thompson
              represent several oceanographic disciplines and will fully utilize the
              capabilities of the vessel. Operations in 2000 will take place mainly along the
              Pacific Coast, Mexico, and near Hawaii.  The Thompson will support system
              trials of the ONR PROD submersible drilling system.  Scheduling for the
              Thompson has been especially difficult as a result of the uncertainty of
              available funds from NOAA for the GLOBEC cruises.  The GLOBEC cruise off the
              West Coast from North California to the Straits of the Juan de Fuca Ridge
              system is currently scheduled on the Thompson from mid-May through June.  The
              Thompson will also support the JASON ROV for two cruises.  New berthing spaces
              will be installed during shipyard time in February.  The Thompson will be in
              port from early October through December.

The Barnes is a 65.5 ft. vessel,
              constructed in 1966, and is owned by NSF and is operated by The University of
              Washington.  The vessel is scheduled for a total of 99 operational days during
              2000, of which 26 days are in support of NSF-supported investigators.  The
              remaining cruises will support ONR, NOAA, EPA, State and private projects.  The
              projects scheduled on the Barnes represent several oceanographic disciplines,
              including chemical and biological oceanography, and will fully utilize the
              capabilities of the vessel. Operations in 2000 will take place locally in the
              coastal waters of Washington and Oregon.

The R/Vs Thomas G. Thompson and
              Clifford A. Barnes are part of a fleet of ships used by the National Science
              Foundation in support of marine science research.  Most oceanographic projects
              require highly specialized equipment to be permanently installed on the
              vessels, thus the necessity for specialized ships.  These vessels do not
              operate in the same mode as general cargo/fishing vessels.  As a result, NSF
              supports the operation of a variety of ships specifically dedicated to
              oceanographic research that are operated by universities and institutions
              around the country.
