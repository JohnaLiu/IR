Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to design a process for the production and recovery
              of ajmalicine from immobilized Catharanthus. roseus.  In this process, the
              medium would be cycled between the bioreactor and the adsorbent column.  The
              rate of product removal would be optimized to improve production, maximize
              recovery of product from the cell, and sustain long-term production of the
              cultures.  Specific objectives of this project are to identify the steps which
              affect the production and recovery of ajmalicine, determine their associated
              kinetics, and then incorporate these rates into a model which can then be
              applied to optimize the strategy of resin addition.
