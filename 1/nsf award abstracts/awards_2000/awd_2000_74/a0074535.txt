Abstract    :
                  In most rural areas, plant emissions of isoprene are the dominant source of
              reactive hydrocarbons.  During the past three summers, we have made flux
              measurements of isoprene over a mixed northern hardwood forest in northern
              Michigan as part of the Program for Research on Oxidants: Photochemistry,
              Emissions, and Transport (PROPHET), located at the University of Michigan
              Biological Station (UMBS).  We have discovered a very strong correlation
              between sensible heat flux and isoprene flux on a daily basis.  If the basis
              for this correlation can be understood, using heat flux as a model parameter
              for isoprene emissions would represent a significant advance in our ability to
              model isoprene fluxes.  Heat flux is an inherent surface layer parameter
              predicted in all mesoscale meteorological models and global circulation models.
              Thus, it is readily available for modeling isoprene on regional and global
              scales.  In this project we will continue our isoprene flux measurements at the
              PROPHET/Ameriflux site during the next two growing seasons.  We will employ a
              fast isoprene analyzer along with fast CO2, water vapor, and temperature
              sensors to obtain continuous flux measurements throughout the growing season.
