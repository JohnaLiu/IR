Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the areas of
              Systematic Biology and Animal Behavior and is entitled "Comparative Methods and
              Data Representation for Structured Traits, Including Temporal Sequences in
              Behavior, Morphology and Development".  Many traits of organisms, especially in
              behavior, morphology, and development exhibit structured relationships with
              other traits.  Examples of structuring include temporal sequences in behavior
              and development and whole-part relationships in morphology.  This project
              develops software to apply phylogenetically informed comparative methods to
              traits in structured relationships.  Developing these methods and their
              underlying representations is an important step in integrating diverse
              phenotypic data.
