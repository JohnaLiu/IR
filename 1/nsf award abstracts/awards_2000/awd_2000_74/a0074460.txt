Abstract    :
                   The investigator and his colleague atudy the computation of
global
              attractors and invariant manifolds for dissipative partial
differential
              equations.  Global attractors are detected by
interpolation of analytic (in
              complex time) rather than direct
simulations.  The performance of this
              approach is connected to
the growth rate of solutions backward in time. 
              Computations are
carried out to determine if a set of solutions with a
              particular
rate is in fact a manifold.  Adaptations of a
              succesful
contraction mapping algorthm for inertial manifolds are made
              for
center manifolds and foliations.  Specific applications are made
to
              physical models including the Camassa-Holm,
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and
              Navier-Stokes equations, including
issues from turbulence theory.
     This
              project concerns a variety of mathematical equations
describing such physical
              phenomena as combustion, fluid flow, and
turbulence.  Part of the effort is to
              develop a method to
reliably determine whether a particular computed
              solution
represents permanent or merely temporary behavior.  Another
concerns
              the visualization of geometric objects corresponding to
distinguished sets of
              solutions, which determine the ultimate
behavior of the physical system. 
              Though the work is carried out
for several specific, physically significant
              equations, it is
general enough to extend, in a natural way, to many others of
              a
similar form, including some modeling the weather.
