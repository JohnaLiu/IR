Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop technical cost models to assess the
              solid oxide fuel cell technology.  The program will focus on developing the
              required skills and methodologies for doing the assessments.  Presently, cost
              is estimated using the averaged cost factors derived from those used for
              conventional power plants.  The cost calculations give little insight to
              critical design or strategic decision questions.  The use of technical cost
              models based on engineering insight will provide guidance as to the
              competitiveness of materials or processing choices.  The primary focus will be
              on acquiring tools and methodologies. 

This research should provide
              methodologies for using technical cost models with fuel cell technology being
              used as a case study.  The effort will progress from the cell component level
              to the level responsible for considering materials and processing choices. The
              project will provide decision-makers with the ability to design, determine the
              materials required, and processing alternatives.
