Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology
              for FY 2000.  

The research and training plan is in the area of ecosystem
              studies and is entitled "Microbial linkages among ecocystem components in the
              McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica."  These valleys provide a unique environment
              to study biocomplexity in extreme environments.  This research links microbial
              community structure and function with physical and biogeochemical processes in
              the lakes, streams, and terrestrial systems using a suite of biochemical and
              molecular biological techniques.
