Our main goal is to use the O-isotopes to better
              understand the evolution of solar nebula and the first generations of chondrite
              parent bodies.  We use ion-probe studies of oxygen isotopes in the phases of
              the most-primitive chondritic meteorites in order (1) to evaluate the isotopic
              compositions of oxygen reservoirs in the solar nebula and to gather evidence
              relating to the spatial and temporal variations in these reservoirs, and (2) to
              better understand the nature of aqueous alteration processes (that mainly
              occurred in asteroids) and the nebular source(s) of the asteroidal water. Our
              work is carried out thin sections, thus we have precise information about the
              petrographic setting of each probed spot.  We examine the O-isotopic evidence
              regarding changes in the composition of the nebular gas recorded in the
              chondrules of carbonaceous chondrites and possible models to account for the
              differences in the O-isotopic composition of chondrules and refractory
              inclusions.  In our studies of aqueous alteration in chondritic asteroids a key
              phase is magnetite produced by the oxidation of Fe metal, during which all O
              comes from the oxidant, probably H2O.  Thus, the magnetite is a proxy for
              asteroidal water.  We also study chondrule olivine and other alteration phases
              such as fayalite in order to obtain enough petrographic information to evaluate
              possible models.
