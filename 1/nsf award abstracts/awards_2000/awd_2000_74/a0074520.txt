Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              Eukaryotic Genetics and is entitled "Analysis of Microarray Data to Identify
              Adaptive Promoters".  This bioinformatic study will examine sequence variation
              in proximal promoters of genes involved with metabolic processes, and
              distinguish "useful" variations (i.e. variations associated with adaptation)
              from random variations that have no functional significance.  Comparisons of
              microarray analyses of genes expressed in cardiac tissue of different
              populations of teleost Fundulus, which exhibit different cardiac metabolisms,
              can identify genes linked to metabolic processes.  In Fundulus, genes whose
              transcription is altered (increased) by transcription factor SP1 will also be
              identified by using microarray technology, as these genes are preceded by
              promoter sequences that bind  SP1.  The subset of genes that are 1. Associated
              with cardiac metabolism, and 2. Affected by presence and concentration of SP1,
              will be further examined to determined which variations are adaptive.
