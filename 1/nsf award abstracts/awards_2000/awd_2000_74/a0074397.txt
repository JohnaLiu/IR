Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology
              for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Microbial
              Genetics and is entitled "Role of Gene Control Mechanisms in Microbial Methane
              Production."  The primary goal of this study is to identify and characterize
              the mechanism for genetic regulatory control of methanogenesis, which has a
              pivotal role in the global carbon cycle.  A combination of physiological and
              genetic approaches is being used to investigate the control networks that
              mediate expression of a catabolic gene encoding carbon monoxide dehydrogenase
              in the methanogen Methanosarcina actevorans.
