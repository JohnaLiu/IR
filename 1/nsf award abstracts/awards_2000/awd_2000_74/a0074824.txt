Abstract    :
              The PI will work on solving polynomials and systems of polynomials.  Polynomial
              equations and systems are used in many areas of scientific computing and
              engineering: mechanism theory, robotics, chemistry.
The development of
              efficient and reliable algorithms for solving these problems are important
              particularly for systems with a large number of variables.

The goal of this
              project is to extend the path lifting method which is well understood in the
              case of a single variable equation, to a system of polynomials.

She will
              begin with a special case of a map from  a Riemann surface.  For the more
              general case, she will work jointly, with teams at Toulouse and at Stony Brook
              and communicate with S. Smale, F. Cucker(Hong Kong) and M. Shub (NY).
 
This
              plan  includes  implementing  this algorithm,  large scale experiments
              involving various types of Newton method  and  choices of initial points. We
              will gather numerical evidence in terms of complexity and  in terms of
              stability with respect to finite precision computations.

POWRE will supports
              her visit to City University of Hong Kong, IBM Watson Center, and Toulouse to
              collaborate (and consult) with experts in the field.  Under POWRE, PI will
              mentor 3 undergraduate students including two minority students at SUNY at Old
              Westbury to develop their academic interests towards graduate studies in
              mathematics.

This POWRE project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences
              (DMS).
