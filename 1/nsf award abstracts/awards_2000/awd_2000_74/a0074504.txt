Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              Animal Behavior and is entitled "Signal Evolution and Speciation in the Common
              Paradise Kingfisher Complex".  The means by which changes in mating signals
              lead to the formation of new species remain an unresolved issue in biology. 
              The proposed research addresses this question via study of populations of the
              paradise kingfisher (T.galatea).  These populations exhibit different plumage
              traits and may represent early stages of speciation.  Using Geographic
              Information System, molecular genetics, and spectrographs, this study will
              determine how differences in environmental conditions, through induction of
              changes in plumage traits between populations, leads to reproductive isolation
              of a given population and, in turn, speciation.
