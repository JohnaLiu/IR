Most work on the evolution of
              self-fertilization has focused on the interactions between inbreeding
              depression and the gene-transmission advantage of selfing.  Theoretical models
              predict that populations should evolve toward either predominant outcrossing or
              predominant selfing.  However a third of all taxa for which the mating system
              has been estimated engage in a mixture of selfing and outcrossing.  This lack
              of accord between theory and data suggest that factors other than inbreeding
              depression and gene transmission should influence the evolution of
              self-fertilization in natural plant populations.  The PI will investigate how
              pollination ecology influences mixed mating systems. She will investigate the
              extent of mating variation among populations of the plant, A. coerulea, confirm
              the difference in major pollinators previously reported among populations, and
              start investigating geitonogamy, reproductive assurance, and floral
              characteristics.  She wishes to establish a research program in plant breeding
              system evolution after working on a different problem for a number of years and
              reinvigorate her program doing this exploratory research.
