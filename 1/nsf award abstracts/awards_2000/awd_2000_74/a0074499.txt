Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              Ecology and is entitled "Reconstructing Biogeography: Tree Species as a Novel
              Explanation for North American Bird Population Declines".  	One of the most
              visible environmental problems in eastern North America is the decline of many
              populations of breeding birds.  While deforestation and loss of habitat have
              been identified as the causes for some species, they do not explain the
              population decline of the remainder.  Important factors, such as quality of
              breeding habitat, have not been sufficiently studied.  This research examines
              the alternative hypothesis that historical changes in forest composition, such
              as the decline of previously dominant tree species, is contributing to changes
              in bird populations due to species' preferences for particular trees. 
              Examination of morphology (bill, leg, foot, wing, and tail dimensions) of
              various bird species allows characterization of their preferences for specific
              trees and in turn provides a means to identify correlations between tree
              species and bird species population decline.
