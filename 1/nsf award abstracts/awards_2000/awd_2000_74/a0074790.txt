POWRE: 
              Mathematical Modeling of Multi-Agent Systems

This POWRE proposal outlines a
              novel physics-based approach to solving computer science problems.  The
              proposed activity leverages the author's training in physics, particularly the
              physics of complex systems, and applies to the study of multi-agent systems. 
              The goal of the research is to propose a feasible mechanism in which
              interactions between agents with simple local strategies lead to desirable
              group behavior in each of the two domains: coalition formation in a multiagent
              system and dynamic routing in a sensor network.  The proposed mechanism is then
              analyzed and a mathematical model of the process is constructed.  The model is
              expressed as a series of coupled differential equations.  For the coalition
              formation problem, for instance, the model describes how the number and
              distribution of coalitions change with time.  The solutions of the equations
              describe collective behavior, and they can be analyzed for different values of
              the parameters.
