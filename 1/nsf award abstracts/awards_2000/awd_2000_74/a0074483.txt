Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              Ecological and Evolutionary Physiology  and is Phylogenetic Comparative Methods
              to Analyze Host-Parasite Trait Evolution". The aim of this proposal is to
              develop comparative methods to test for correlated evolution.  Previous
              investigations of host-parasite evolution have provided analyses of the
              congruence of the phylogenetic trees of hosts and parasites, yet have failed to
              characterize and describe correlative/causal effects on trait evolution.  The
              aims of this research are 1. To use simulation techniques to identify the
              statistical consequences of different levels of host-parasite tree congruence
              on comparative studies of trait evolution, via computer simulation 2. Develop a
              system that minimizes statistical bias and inconsistency when host-parasite
              trees are not fully congruent, and 3. Apply these methods to real-world
              datasets to test hypotheses for host-parasite trait evolution in primates and
              carnivores.  This research will contribute greatly to knowledge of evolution.
