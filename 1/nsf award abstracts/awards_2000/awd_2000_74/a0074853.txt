Abstract    :
              This POWRE award provides funding that would allow the PI to expand on the
              initiation of a new research activity at Thomas Jefferson Nuclear Accelerator
              Facility (TJNF).  This proposal will allow the PI to participate in TJNAF
              experiment 093-038, 'The electric and Magnetic Form Factors of the Neutron' to
              further advance her research career.  This experiment addresses a fundamental
              question regarding the nature of the charge structure of the neutron: What is
              the spatial distribution of the constituent quark within the neutron?  The
              question is addressed in this experiment by scattering longitudinally polarized
              electrons quasi-elastically from a neutron in deuterium. The award is funded by
              the NSF POWRE program, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the MPS
              Directorate, and the Physics Division.
