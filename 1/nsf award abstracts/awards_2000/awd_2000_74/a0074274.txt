Abstract    :
              The POWRE grant will serve as an opportunity to extend and develop her research
              at a critical time in her career.  This proposal adddresses the fundamental
              theoretical question of the origins of mass. The PI's research involves the
              causes of electroweak symmetry breaking and the mechanisms responsible for the
              diverse masses of the quarks and leptons, the elementary constituents of
              matter.  While the standard model of particle physics can accommodate massive
              particles, it does not explain the dynamics through which mass arises.  This
              proposal seeks to advance the understanding of the origins of mass by exploring
              physics that lies outside the Standard Model.  The PI will employ techniques
              ranging from field theory to model building to computer simulation.  The award
              is funded by the NSF POWRE program, the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
              in the MPS Directorate, and the Physics Division.
