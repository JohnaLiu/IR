ABSTRACT

The level set method
              devised by Osher and Sethian in 1988 has proven to be phenomenally successful
              as a numerical and theoretical device for representing and analyzing the motion
              of curves in R^2 and surfaces in R^3.  A level set calculus has been developed,
              and recent extensions include the ghost fluid method, convolution generated
              motion, dynamic surface extension, the variational level set approach, and the
              motion of higher codimensional objects.  Recent applications include multiphase
              fluid dynamics, the island dynamics model for epitaxial growth, level set based
              interpolation of unorganized points, and fast methods in image restoration. 
              This work was partially supported by our previous NSF grants.  The goal of this
              proposed research is to extend the technology and the range of applications
              through the following two projects:
(1)  Convolution generated motion for
              filaments.
(2)  Fast algorithms for steady state geometric Hamilton-Jacobi
              equations and
     the induced motion of fronts.

The level set method is
              rapidly becoming the method of choice to simulate on the computer a host of
              important physical, biological, materials science, image processing, computer
              vision, electromagnetic and other real world problems.  In particular areas of
              nanotechnology will also be impacted.  Improvements of the numerical methods
              used to simulate these phenomena will ultimately be crucial in the design of
              computer chips, analysis of explosions, recognition of objects and many other
              areas of modern technology.  This proposal addresses further improvements of
              the level set and related methods.
