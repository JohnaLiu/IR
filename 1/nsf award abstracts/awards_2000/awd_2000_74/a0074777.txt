PROPOSAL:  DEB 0074777

The P.I. proposes a project to study the
              phylogeny of the grass tribe, Andropogoneae.  Which includes 85 genera.  Past
              work supports monophyly of the tribe based on spike morphology, leaf blade
              anatomy, and to some extent molecular data.  Recent molecular studies, however,
              seem discrepant: recent work suggests the tribe is polyphyletic.  She would
              like to investigate this hypothesis by reconsidering the taxa analyzes, the
              type of molecular marker used, and the addition of novel developmental and
              morphological characteristics.  She will study species of the core genera
              Andropogoneae and use data from nuclear ribsomal DNA sequences, floral
              development and seedling morphology in order to obtain a more robust phylogeny.
