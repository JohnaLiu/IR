Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              Ecology and is entitled "Evaluating Alternative Biodiversity Conservation
              Hypotheses: A test of the Coarse-Filter Paradigm".  GIS and computer modeling
              are used in this study to develop a coarse-filter computer model for
              conservation reserve network planning in Ecuador.  The model will generate
              multiple alternative "biodiversity reserve hypotheses" with variable sets of
              increasing complexity and spatial resolution.  The efficacy of the model will
              then be evaluated with extensive biotic inventory databases for birds and
              plants.
