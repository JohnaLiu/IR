Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              Integrated Plant Biology and is entitled "An Analysis of genetic architecture,
              gene expression, and phenotypic variation within resynthesized Brassica napus
              polyploids." The goal of this study is to investigate the phenomenon of
              polyploidization (fusion of two genomes into one) in flowering plants, via
              resynthesizing fifty lines of the natural polypoid Brassica napus from its
              diploid progenitors Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea.  Changes in genomic
              architecture, gene expression, and phenotype between the diploid parents, the
              progeny of the resynthesized B. napus, and the fourth generation offspring of
              the resynthesized plants are being examined.  These experiments will determine
              the nature of the changes within individual, resynthesized polyploid genomes
              and whether or not these changes are shared among independently derived
              polyploids.  Such changes will be identified by comparisons of gene expression
              using Northern blots and DNA microarrays.
