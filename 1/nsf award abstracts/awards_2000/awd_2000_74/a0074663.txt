POWRE: 
              Time-Frequency Analysis of Signals with Non-Linear Structures


This
              proposal focuses on investigation of the feasibility of obtaining new quadratic
              time-frequency representations that are matched with non-linear group delay,
              while exhibiting a maximum concentration and reducing the effect of cross
              terms. In addition, this work will address a new line of research in analyzing
              the difficult case of multicomponent signals with different types of linear
              and/or non-linear structures present simultaneously.  The proposed methodology
              will involve a matching pursuit dictionary with basis functions of different
              types of group delay.
