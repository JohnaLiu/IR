Abstract    :
              This award from Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program of
              the Chemistry Division  supports research of Professor Kenneth N. Raymond,
              Department of Chemistry, University of California at Berkeley into
              superamolecular clusters assembled by mean of metal-ligand coordinate bonds.
              The project will focus on the synthesis of expanded host-volume clusters, the
              formation and rearrangement of supramolecular clusters, the control of guest
              molecule reactivity by supramolecular hosts. It is the goal of   the research
              to precisely define what can be programmed into a ligand in   terms of
              predetermined symmetry based linkages and to exploit this to  develop new
              chemistry based on supramolecular self-assembly.      

 Large,
              supramolecular structures of tetrahedra, cubes and   dodecahedra will be
              synthesized with metal ions at the vertices and  organic linkers along the
              edges.  Symmetry-based principles developed in  this work will be generally
              applicable to the preparation of other  nanostructures. The ability to
              systematically prepare very large molecules with controlled shapes and pore
              cavities will be exploited to catalyze chemical reactions.
