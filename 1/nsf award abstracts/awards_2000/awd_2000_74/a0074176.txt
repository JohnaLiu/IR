Abstract    :
              A joint project (Parameterization of the Aerosol Climatic Effect, PACE) between
              experimentalists and modelers who have expertise in aerosol chemistry, cloud
              microphysics, radiative transfer and climate modeling has recently been
              initiated to address the issue of aerosol interaction with clouds, referred to
              the aerosol indirect effect. 

The PI proposes to compare ACE-2 field
              campaign data with cloud properties and radiative fluxes simulated by the NASA
              GISS SCM along with that simulated by other models. The objectives are to
              rigorously assess the models and develop and test more realistic schemes for
              representing aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions in climate models. The work
              is important because it will contribute to narrowing the large range of
              uncertainty in model simulations of the indirect effects of anthropogenic
              aerosols, thereby facilitating more reliable predictions of global and regional
              climatic change.
