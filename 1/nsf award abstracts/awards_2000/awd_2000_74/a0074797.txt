Abstract    :
              This POWRE award by the Chemistry Division supports Dr. Jetty Duffy-Matzner in
              developing a research program in small molecule heterocyclic chemistry at
              Augustana College in Sioux Falls South Dakota. The objective of this research
              will be to synthesize, characterize and test the antibiotic activity of a
              series of polymers with the potential ability to disrupt the sodium and
              potassium concentration differences across cellular membranes. This award will
              allow Dr. Duffy-Matzner to:  establish a joint collaboration with Dr. Nola
              Borman, Assistant Professor of Biology at Augustana College to explore the
              biological activities of the novel compounds synthesized in the project;
              involve advanced students in Augustana's medicinal chemistry course in
              molecular modelling; create summer research experiences  for Dr.
              Duffy-Matzner's undergraduate student co-workers in the laboratory of Dr. Karin
              Ruhlandt-Senge, an inorganic chemist at Syracuse University, who will also
              collaborate with Dr. Duffy-Matzner on this project. This award will contribute
              significantly to the professional advancement of Dr. Duffy-Matzner, at a
              critical stage in her career.
