The thrust interface between the subducting Phillipine Sea
              plate and the overriding Eurasian plate, which lies underneath Tokyo, is one of
              the most dangerous faults on earth.  Due to low seismicity levels, the location
              of this fault has been inferred only indirectly from the locations of
              earthquakes occurring within the subducted oceanic plate that have
              uncertainties of about 3-5 km.  The PI will use recent improvements in
              earthquake relocation techniques, as well as a larger dataset to map out the
              location and shape of the trust interface with relocated earthquakes of
              potential accuracy on the order of ~100 m.  The catalog of extremely accurate
              relative earthquake locations will provide the basis for studies of the
              mechanical properties of the fault, involving repeating earthquakes, space-time
              rupture inversions of moderate size events, and possibly geodetic imaging of
              slip transients in the region.  This combination of studies should improve
              estimates of the seismic hazard in the Kanto-Tokai region as well as our
              understanding of earthquake rupture and fault mechanics.
