Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology
              for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Regulation of
              Gene Expression and is entitled "Identification of Novel Pseudomonas aeruginosa
              Quorum Sensing Genes".  Monitoring of surroundings by quorum sensing in P.
              aeruginosa, a gram-negative bacterium, plays an important role in its ability
              to grow in a wide variety of conditions.  The two best studied quorum-sensing
              systems are the las and rhl systems.  This research utilizes a fluorescence
              activated cell sorter (FACS)-based approach to identify novel genes positively
              and negatively regulated by the las and/or rhl system.  Temporal induction or
              repression of the identified genes is examined during the growth cycle, and
              regulatory factors dictating the induction and/or repression of these genes are
              identified.  In addition, the functions of these genes are examined via
              insertional activation and observation of the phenotypic changes.
