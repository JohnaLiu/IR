Abstract    :
              It is clear that nervous system function can be influenced by factors released
              from a variety of non-neuronal cells. The PI, Dr. Clatworthy, has been using a
              simple model system, the marine mollusc Aplysia californica, to understand
              fundamental mechanisms underlying the modulation of neuronal activity by
              non-neuronal cells. Specifically, she has established that a population of
              non-neuronal cells (hemocytes) present in the blood of Aplysia can influence
              the electrophysiological properties of a population of identified sensory
              neurons. To further develop this line of research, it will be necessary to
              learn the identity of these hemocyte-derived neuromodulators. 
The goal of
              this POWRE proposal is to allow the PI, an electrophysiologist by training, to
              spend 12 months in the laboratory of Dr. Ken Bost, a molecular biologist,
              learning a variety of molecular techniques that will be applied directly to
              identifying the factors released by the hemocytes in Aplysia. This cross
              disciplinary approach will advance knowledge in the field of sensory plasticity
              by allowing the PI to integrate information from both electrophysiological and
              molecular studies. Results obtained in this simple model system can then be
              used to formulate hypotheses regarding non-neuronal cell modulation of sensory
              neuron function in more complex, less accessible model systems. Furthermore,
              because hemocytes have a cellular defense function in Aplysia, learning the
              identity of hemocyte-derived factors may also provide important clues regarding
              the origins and evolution of mediators of the immune system.
