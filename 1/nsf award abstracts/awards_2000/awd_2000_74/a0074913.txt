Abstract    :
              This POWRE award by the Chemistry Division will permit Dr. Nancy Levinger to
              extend her sabbatical leave from Colorado State University to a full year of
              work in the laboratory of M.D. Fayer at Stanford University, where she will
              learn the use of ultrafast lasers to obtain vibrational coherence spectra as
              well as brush up on the time dependent quantum mechanical theoretical
              description of the non-linear signals generated by such experiments. She will
              apply these vibrational echo techniques in her continuing study of
              intermolecular interactions in extrememly small, nanoscale, reverse micelles
              upon her return to Colorado State University. Vibrational echo spectroscopy has
              been shown to greatly sharpen spectra allowing more precise information about
              the chemical environment of the sample to be obtained. Reverse micelles are
              important systems with which to model biomembranes and nanoscale reactions.
