It is now known that small lipids can mediate 
              cell to cell communication, not unlike the traditional classes of extracellular
               signaling molecules such as peptide neurotransmitters.  While much work has
              been done in in vitro cell culture  studies to document  biological effects of
              small lipids, it is only with the recent cloning of receptor families for small
              lipids that it has become  to systematically study potential sites and
              mechanisms of action in vivo.  In particular, while these lipids promote the
              survival of immature non-neuronal supporting cells in vitro, it would be of use
              to know if there are similar effects in the adult organism. The studies
              impossible this POWRE  Proposal will determine which non-neuronal cell types
              possess receptors for bioactive lipids and also test whether differences in
              receptor levels influence the survival of these cells in vivo.
This POWRE
              proposal will allow the investigator, after a career interruption for family
              responsibilities, an unprecedented opportunity to acquire new skills in the use
              of molecular biological techniques.  It is anticipated that this funding will
              provide support for the generation of pilot data that is necessary to compete
              for grants by standard mechanisms.
