Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              Ecology and is entitled "Development of a Biogeographical Information System
              for Seamounts". Seamounts, which are volcanic peaks found within the ocean and
              rise 1000 feet above the ocean floor (yet not breaking the surface), exist in a
              variety of locations and latitudes, and may be highly representative of several
              aspects of biodiversity.  This project creates an oceanographic information
              system by aggregating global biogeographic data from seamounts into a
              database/GIS system which is used to map and explain patterns of seamount
              biodiversity, and will be freely accessible over the internet to aid research,
              management, and education.
