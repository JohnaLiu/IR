Abstract    :
              Ondrechen
This POWRE award is for a 15 month sabbatical for the PI at Brandeis
              University, working with Professor Dagmar Ringe's group on enzymatic systems
              that use pyridoxal phosphate (Vitamin B6) as a cofactor.  A quantum
              mechanical-molecular mechanical model for enzyme-substrate interactions will be
              developed and applied to the vitamin B6-dependent enzymes alanine racemase and
              D-amino acid aminotransferase.  This project will enable the PI to expand her
              knowledge in the biochemical and biomedical areas and develop a research
              program in these areas.  The project is also designed to enhance our
              understanding of how enzymes perform their functions as catalysts.
