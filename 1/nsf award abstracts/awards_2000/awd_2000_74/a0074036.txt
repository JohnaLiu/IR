This project proposes an experimental program to continue
              an investigation of the solubility and mineral/melt partitioning behavior of
              highly siderophile elements.  The proposed work bears directly on the use of
              Re-Os, Pt-Os isotopes and platinum-group elements (PGEs) as petrogenetic
              tracers of Earth evolution and igneous processes as well as thermodynamics and
              economic geology of the noble metals. The major scientific goals of this
              continuing program are to quantify the geochemistry of the elements Re, Pt, Os,
              and other PGEs with respect to their siderophile and lithophile behavior.  An
              understanding of the geochemical systematics of noble metal parent-daugther
              isotope pairs is essential in interpreting these systems in terms of major
              active Earth processes as well as in the accretion and primordial
              differentiation of the early Earth.
