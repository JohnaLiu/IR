Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology
              for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Plant and
              Microbial Developmental Mechanisms and is entitled "Evolution of Morphological
              Variation Across Dictyostelid Social Amoebae".  While most microbes live
              solitary lives, a few groups have evolved more complex multicellular
              strategies.  The multicellular structures of one such group, the Dictyostelids,
              are extremely variable both in size and overall morphology.  This work examines
              the evolution of morphological diversity across Dictyostelid species using a
              comparative approach.  Three questions are addressed: To what extent are
              mechanisms that affect size and pattern conserved across solitary amoebas
              (SA's)?  What specific molecular changes underlie the divergent morphologies
              observed across SA species?  What is the molecular evolutionary history of
              genes involved in SA fruiting body size and pattern formation?  This research
              provides insight into the evolutionary origins of their morphological variation
              and begins to address the evolution of these social organisms from solitary
              ones.
