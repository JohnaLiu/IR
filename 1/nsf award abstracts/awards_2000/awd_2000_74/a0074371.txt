Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology
              for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Systematic
              Biology and is entitled "Study of Ancyromonas as a Possible Ancestor to All
              Metazoa, Fungi, and Choanoflagellates".  Preliminary analysis of 18S rDNA
              sequences from the flagellate genus Ancyromonas suggests it is descended from
              the specific common ancestor of multicellular metazoa and fungi.  Additional
              phylogenetically-informative genes from species of Ancyromonas are being
              sequenced and analyzed to determine if there is an extant unicellular ancestor
              to this group.  Morphology and ultrastructure of Ancyromonas species also are
              being studied and compared with metazoan and fungal species to determine the
              extent of shared characteristics suggestive of common ancestry.  Fluorescent
              in-situ probe hybridization (FISH) technology is used to look for undiscovered
              species of this globally-distributed genus in an effort to find and culture
              unique species for this and future study.
