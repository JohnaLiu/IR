Abstract    :
               This proposal seeks to develop a model of technology-based education and
              research in a community-based program that serves Latino communities.  The
              focus is on how new ideas are accepted and communicated.  It seeks to
              understand how technology can be better used outside of the structured
              classrooms by individuals who are not typical users of technology.  

The
              project uses IMMEX (Interactive Multi-media Exercises).  The project seeks to
              study 1) what people understand as they solve complex problems and 2) how they
              use information to solve these problems.
