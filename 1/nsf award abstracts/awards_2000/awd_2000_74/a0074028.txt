Abstract    :
              This project concerns the connection between fundamental 
problems in number
              theory, zeros of arithmetic L-functions,
and random matrix theory.  Recent
              developments have placed 
the confluence of these fields at the center of a
              great 
deal of important work that combines activity and interest 
from
              researchers previously working in completely 
different areas. The study of
              zeros of arithmetic 
Dirichlet series, or L-functions, occupies a central
              
position in number theory and includes within its realm 
both the Riemann
              Hypothesis and the Birch and 
Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. The theory of
              eigenvalues of 
random matrices is a subject begun nearly 50 years ago by
              
physicists interested in the statistics of energy 
levels of excited
              particles. The connection between these 
two fields was revealed for the first
              time in 1974 in the 
paper ``The pair correlation of the zeros of the
              
zeta-function'' by H. L. Montgomery. This project will 
involve both number
              theorists and mathematical 
physicists to develop a comprehensive new model
              
for families of L-functions in 
order to gain insights into a number of
              fundamental open 
problems about L-functions. For example, by combining
              
random matrix theory and number theory appropriately, 
the principal
              investigator and his colleagues intend to 
(i) find all of the terms in
              asymptotic formulae for 
moments of families of L-functions, (ii) determine
              
precisely how large the extreme-most values of 
L-functions can be, and
              (iii) analyze the vanishing 
at the central critical point for 
families of
              L-functions.


In 1859 Bernhard Riemann made a conjecture about an
              important
function known as the zeta-function.   
Riemann's hypothesis is
              still unproven and is widely 
regarded as the most important unsolved problem
              in
mathematics. It has long been known that the solution of
this problem
              would have significant applications to 
cryptography, coding theory, and the
              study of 
prime numbers. Recently, it has also been realized that 
the
              zeta-function and the closely related L-functions 
provide models for the
              behavior of fundamental particles in 
physics.  The project `L-functions:
              symmetry and zeros' 
will bring mathematicians and physicists together to
              
explore this amazing connection more deeply through the 
use of a
              statistical tool called `random matrix theory.'
