The main objective of this project is a quantitative
              investigation of a
versatile methodology for zero-alignment integration of
              micro-optical and
micro-electronic components.  This methodology is based on
              the concept of a
bulk-micromachined substrate that plays the role of an
              optical table. The PI's
propose a micro-optical table (MOT) on which a variety
              of optical elements,
light sources, e.g., surface-emitting lasers, and
              photo-detectors can be
accurately positioned without the need for extensive
              alignment.  In the
course of this project we will:  (1) design and fabricate
              prototype MOT
mounting slots for optical elements, (2) perform MOT
              micro-assembly
experiments, and (3) develop and apply metrology techniques to
              characterize
the assembled micro-optical systems.  The research proposed here
              will permit
a quantitative judgment regarding the suitability of the MOT
              concept for
applications in biomedical sensing, biomedical imaging, optical
              data
storage, and chemical sensing."
