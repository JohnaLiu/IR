Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              Molecular Biophysics and is entitled "Mechanisms into the folding of Arc
              Repressor: A theoretical study". In this proposal, a theoretical investigation
              into the mechanism of the folding of Arc Repressor using developments in the
              study of kinetics and dynamics of protein systems will be presented. A Master
              Equation for describing the folding kinetics of protein models (recently
              demonstrated by Scheraga), as well as the stochastic path approach of Elber,
              will be used in a corroborative way to elucidate the particular kinetic
              mechanism of the well-studied Arc Repressor. While the emphasis of this
              proposal is on application of existing models of protein folding of Arc
              Repressor, specific theoretical extensions will be developed both with regard
              to numerical methods and optimizations and with alternative formulations of the
              model itself.
