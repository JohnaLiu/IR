The goal of this research is to
              develop new approaches and guidelines for conserving "interaction
              biodiversity."  Interaction biodiversity refers to the myriad ways in which
              pairs and groups of species interact with one another - both within and among
              populations - as well as to the diversity of outcomes elicited by these
              interactions.  Despite growing concern over the loss of interaction
              biodiversity and its potential evolutionary and ecological consequences,
              traditional approaches to reserve network design are based primarily on
              species-level and ecosystem-level considerations.  Most conservation decisions
              are intended to minimize or prevent the extinction of species or the loss of
              ecosystem function.  The view is that if we worry about species and ecosystems,
              the interactions will 'take care of themselves.'  The PI will use a combination
              of ecological and evolutionary theory and empirical data to develop guidelines
              for conserving interaction biodiversity and to increase understanding of the
              potential consequences of species and ecosystem-level decisions for species
              interactions.
