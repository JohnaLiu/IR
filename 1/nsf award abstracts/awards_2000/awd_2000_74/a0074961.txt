Abstract    :
              This POWRE grant will support the PI to edit a book on African climate
              variability. She will also partially author some chapters. The PI is branching
              to a relatively new field of the role of aerosols in climate with a focus on
              African climate. The PI will also conduct a workshop on the topic.  The work is
              important because it will further understanding on African climate variability.
