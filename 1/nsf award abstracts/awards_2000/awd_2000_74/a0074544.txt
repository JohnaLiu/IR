Abstract

The research equipment
              requested, Advanced Rheometrics Expansion System (ARES) is a powerful and
              versatile rheological instrument, which will enable the PI and his colleagues
              to measure the rheological properties of various polymeric material in the
              liquid as well as the solid state. Specifically, ARES will enable this research
              group to conduct the following rheological measurements of various polymeric
              materials: (1) transient shear flow, (2) steady-state shear flow, (3) flow
              reversal upon changing the direction of flow, (4) stress relaxation upon
              cessation of shear flow, (5) oscillatory shear flow, (6) creep, (7) temperature
              sweep under isochronal conditions, and (8) torsional oscillatory shear. This
              instrument will allow us to conduct rheological measurements for polymer
              solutions, molten polymers, polymer blends, particulate-filled polymers or
              elastomers.

The precise measurements of the rheological, properties of such
              materials will help develop a new generation of polymeric materials for such
              applications as nanocomposites, computer/electronic parts, and nonlinear
              optical wave-guides. Also, the precise measurements of the rheological
              properties of polymeric materials will help develop new theories and/or modify
              the existing theories, which will relate the chemical structures of polymers to
              their rheological properties.
