Abstract    :
              The PI will develop and analyze fast and accurate numerical schemes for liquid
              crystal flows and for PDEs in unbounded domains, and produce a publicly
              available high performance software package of fast spectral elliptic solvers
              which will be a valuable tool for computational scientists and engineers.  The
              PI will also implement the proposed numerical schemes to investigate several
              important problems of current interest, including in particular the coupling
              and defect motion of liquid crystal flows, and the dynamic control and
              parametric resonance in rotating flows.  The accuracy and efficiency of the
              proposed schemes will allow us to simulate these three-dimensional
              time-dependent flows with a reasonable turn-over time.

Computer simulations
              are playing an ever increasing role in many branches of science and engineering
              and are rapidly replacing much of the expensive prototyping and testing phase
              required before any product is brought to market. Consequently, fast and
              reliable numerical methods/software are becoming an indispensable tool for many
              scientists and engineers, especially for computational scientists in fluid
              dynamics and materials science.  It is expected that our numerical simulations
              will contribute towards better understandings of the complex physical and
              mathematical problems, and provide valuable information for the design of
              advanced materials and of turbo-machinery.
