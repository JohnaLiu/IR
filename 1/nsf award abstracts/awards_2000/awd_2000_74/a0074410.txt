Abstract    :
              With National Science Foundation support Dr. Patrick Williams and his
              collaborators will conduct two seasons of archaeological research at the site
              of Cerro Baul in highland Peru. The site, located in the Moquegua sierra of
              Southern Peru dates to approximately 600-1,000 AD and represents a complete
              administrative center set on top of the most imposing natural feature in the
              region. Two phases of monumental architecture have been identified on the
              summit and these include administrative architecture, religious temples, elite
              domestic contexts and craft production and artisan habitation facilities. On
              the slopes of the mountain mesa domestic terraces inhabited by lower status
              people are present.  The site is particularly interesting because it lies at
              the boundary between two prehistoric empires,  Wari, with a capital in Ayacucho
              to the North and Tiwanaku with its capital in Bolivia. Wari which has been
              characterized as secular and militant, governed most of highland and coastal
              Peru while Tiwanaku, portrayed as ecclesiastical and mercantile held sway over
              Bolivia, southern Peru and Northern Chile. Economically Wari generated
              agricultural revenue by constructing irrigated terraces on steep mountain
              slopes where maize and other crops could grow. Occupying the higher Altiplano
              plains, Tiwanaku reclaimed flat terrain for farming potatoes and other
              high-altitude crops while also herding camelids and using llama caravans to
              secure distant resources.  Luckily for archaeologists the empires employed
              different styles of  imperial architecture and much of their ceramics and
              iconography are also distinct. It is only in the Moquegua region of Peru that
              both Tiwanaku and Wari settlements are found in close proximity and the site of
              Cerro Baul itself contains evidence of both groups. Dr. Williams wishes to
              understand the nature of the interaction between them. Therefore he will
              conduct extensive excavation at the site and carry out a regional survey to
              reconstruct the agricultural systems. With these data he will determine the
              extent to which integration took place and the types of complementary
              strategies employed. Analyses of excavated materials will focus on subsistence
              production systems, domestic activity patterns, craft production systems, elite
              exchange and iconographic relationships.

The case of Wari-Tiwanaku
              interaction provides one of the few examples in prehistory in which the
              influence of peer empires on each other can be examined. By documenting the
              development of political economy and ideological exchange at Cerro Baul, Dr.
              Williams research will make a significant contribution to the anthropological
              study of complex societies and the evolution of Andean statecraft.
