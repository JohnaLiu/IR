Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              population genetics and is entitled "Using Current DNA Polymorphism Data to
              Make Inferences about Past Human Demography."  Statistical analyses and
              extensive computer simulations are being used to determine what models of human
              demography are compatible with existing DNA polymorphism data.  These methods
              can answer important and interesting questions about human populations such as
              when did they start to expand in size and which groups are closely related to
              each other.  The methods are generally applicable to population studies.
