This workshop will be the first "All-hands" meeting of the
              Biotic Surveys and Inventories program, and will include all Principal
              Investigators currently supported by the program.  It will be dedicated to
              examining the successes and failures of projects funded by the program in
              particular, and of the scientific community's attempts to ducment and
              disseminate information on the world's biota in general.  Although the BS&I
              program has existed for approximately 10 years, there has never been a
              community-wide meeting to address shared concerns, interests, methods, or the
              future of such surveys in general.  Topics to be discussed include: the past,
              present and future of BS&I projects and the program itself; the question of
              large scale, long-term projects; the future of electronic data gathering and
              dissemination; the future of funding and partnering with other federal
              agencies, NGOs, and other agencies; the question of site-based biodiversity
              observatories; the use of biotic surveys to document the generation and
              maintenance of biodiversity, and other topics.
