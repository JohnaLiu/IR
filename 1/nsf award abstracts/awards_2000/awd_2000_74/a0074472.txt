Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              Animal Developmental Mechanisms and is entitled "Characterization of
              Transcriptional Networks by Comprehensive Target Identification in
              Drosolphila".   This study proposes to identify transcriptional targets of
              sequence-specific transcription factors in Drosophila, via in-vivo assays using
              approximately 50 transcription factors .  The goal is the identification of
              genes whose transcription produces the complex developmental patterns that
              occur, as well as the resulting diversity in cell function that is necessary to
              create complex organisms.  Further, these data should facilitate attempts at
              computational modeling of transcription factor networks on a scale that
              previously has not been possible.
