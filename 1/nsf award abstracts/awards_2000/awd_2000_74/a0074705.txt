Ecological forecasting is the process of predicting the state of
              ecosystems, ecosystem services, and natural capital, with fully specified
              uncertainties, contingent on explicit scenarios for climate, land use, human
              population, technologies and economic activity. The spatial extents of
              forecasts range form watersheds to regions to continents to the globe. The time
              horizons of the forecasts are typically 10 to 50 years. Projection and
              forecasting involve predicting future ecosystem states based on past activity
              and models that incorporate our understanding of relationships. Planning and
              decision making can be improved by access to reliable forecasts of ecosystem
              state, ecosystem services, and natural capital. Emerging computing capacities
              together with broad-scale ecosystem studies will soon make it possible to
              predict, validate and test many aspects of environmental change. A workshop
              will be held in May 2000 at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and
              Synthesis to develop a science agenda for Ecological Forecasting. Presentations
              from economists, climatologists, demographers, and managers will address
              cross-cutting issues involved in making forecasts. A series of case study
              presentations will involve both ecologists and scientists form related
              disciplines to assess the readiness of ecological science to make forecasts.
              Subsequent discussions will focus on social and physical drivers of ecological
              forecasts, basic research needs, quantifying uncertainty/decision theory, and
              communicating forecasts to the users. The workshop will produce a white paper,
              an overview article and a book.
