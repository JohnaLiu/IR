Abstract    :
              
This award provides funding from the POWRE program to allow Dr. Wright to
              expand her research interests into coastal studies, where her expertise in GIS
              systems can be applied to a greater range of scientific projects than in the
              deep sea. In order to accomplish this shift in research focus, Dr. Wright
              requests funding to apply her GIS expertise to coral reef ecosystem studies
              currently being conducted by the Sustainable Seas Expeditions (SSE) and the
              National Marine Sactuaries System. The PI will develop a database system for
              the Fagatele Bay National Marine Sanctuary (FBNMS) which is located in America
              Samoa. She picked the FBNMS because studies of this site are just beginning
              and, therefore, her GIS expertise could be an integral part of plans for data
              collection. The PI proposes to 1) establish a comprehensive, web-accessible
              data clearinghouse, with GIS maps, and data layers that can be made available
              to the FBNMS collaborators, 2) develop a spatial analytical procedures for
              ecological characterization of the coral reef, which will help to establish
              future survey, monitoring and management protocols, and 3) develop a brief
              exploration of information space modeling as a way to augment the content and
              accessibility of the data clearinghouse.
