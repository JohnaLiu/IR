The objective of
              this POWRE project is to advance research by the development of more
              sophisticated algorithms and mathematical/ computer models based on
              pharmacokinetic analysis for predicting  critical conditions that are
              associated with postoperative complications.  The project is based upon a
              database of computerized anesthesia records that grows by 20,000 cases per
              year.  The paradigm is based upon real clinical cases.  The end porduct of the
              research, beyond project duration, will be prototype intelligent workdtation
              that implements proposed models and algorithms.
