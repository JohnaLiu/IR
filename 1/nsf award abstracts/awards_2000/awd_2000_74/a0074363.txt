Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology
              for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Microbial
              Genetics and is entitled "The Use of Benzoyl-CoA Reductase Genes in the
              Benzoate Pathway as an Indicator of Anaerobic Bacterial Degradation of
              Monoaromatic Hydrocarbon Pollutants".  A key feature of monoaromatic compound
              metabolism by anaerobic bacteria is the enzyme benzoyl-CoA reductase, a protein
              previously thought to be highly conserved among anaerobes.  This research
              examines the diveristy of this important enzyme.  Then, the mechanisms by which
              benzoate degradation takes place are being characterized 1. Via biochemical
              analysis and 2. Mutagenesis-to determine which genes are involved in the
              process.  Finally,  Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis
              is being used to determine the abundance and diversity of these genes in the
              environment.  This study will help assess the appropriateness of reductase
              genes as indicators of a bacterial community's capacity for bioremediation of
              aromatic hydrocarbons in polluted environments.
