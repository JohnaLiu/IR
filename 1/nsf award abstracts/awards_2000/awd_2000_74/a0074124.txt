	Controlled-source electromagnetic induction (CSEM) imaging
              is one of the few scientific tools available for rapid, non-invasive, and
              inexpensive characterization of near-surface, environmentally sensitive sites.
              This award will support the development of three-dimensional CSEM finite
              element code to forward model the effect of topography, soil and rock
              electrical conductivity, and buried subsurface heterogeneities such as buried
              pipelines, metal fences and building structures. The resulting code will enable
              geophysicists to better understand electromagnetic responses in areas with
              complex geological structures, rugged terrain and cultural noise.
