Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for fiscal year 2000.

The research and training plan is in the
              area of ecology and is entitled, " A Web-Based Combinatorial Approach to the
              Effects of Biodiversity Loss on Complex Ecological Networks."  Ecological
              research into biodiversity loss is limited by what experiments can actually be
              conducted and by the underlying theory which is complex, making it difficult to
              separate the many interacting processes.  This project applies global
              optimization techniques and network analyses to high quality food-web data to
              simulate effects of small to large biodiversity losses on complex communities. 
              Systematic deletion of combinations of species in empirical and model food-webs
              are being used to generate theory that distinguishes effects of reducing
              species richness from effects of eliminating particular species' functions on
              ecosystems.
