	The history of soil erosion in central Texas and many other
              regions is poorly known, yet understanding this history is important for
              studies of environmental change and efforts in soil conservation.  We propose
              to quantify the temporal evolution of soil thickness in the vicinity of Hall's
              Cave, which is located in the regionally-extensive Edwards Plateau in Kerr Co.,
              TX.  Soil evolution will be quantified through application of a novel technique
              the uses the strontium isotope composition (87Sr/86Sr of mammalian fossils
              preserved in the cave-filling sediment.  A trenched sediment sequence at Hall's
              Cave contains a rich paleontologic record, and a high resolution chronology was
              constructed for the past 16,000 years of deposition in the cave.  As soils were
              eroded from the Edwards Plateau beginning around 8,000 years ago, the relative
              contribution to the exchangeable strontium pool of Sr derived from the
              limestone bedrock (low 87Sr/86Sr values) should have increased with respect to
              the silicates (high 87Sr/86Sr values) in the soil.  Therefore, the strontium
              isotope ratio of biota living on the landscape will change through time and
              reflect the 87Sr/86Sr value of the exchangeable Sr pool in the soil, and thus
              the soil thickness.  WE will construct a history of soil thickness, which we
              will then compare to independent chemical and biotic proxies for changing
              temperature, moisture, and soil character.  Specific proxies included:  (1) the
              mineralogy and elemental chemistry of the cave sediments as a constraint on the
              soil erosion history; (2) the oxygen isotope ratio of fossils (backberries,
              snails and speleothems as a record of precipitation patterns in the past; (3)
              the carbon isotope ratio of tooth enamel and humus as a proxy for the
              proportion of C4 grass in the paleoecosystem; (4) the palynology of the strata;
              and (5) the paleoecology indicated by the rich vertebrate fauna.  Temporal
              correlation of these environmental proxies with the soil erosion timing and
              rate, as indicated by the Sr isotope variations, will provide essential
              evidence to evaluate the causes of the profound soil erosion that denuded the
              central Texas landscape of its once thick soil.
