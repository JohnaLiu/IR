This is a three cooperative year proposal between Dr.
              Steven Manchester and Dr. David Dicher of the University of Florida and Dr.
              Zhiduan Xhen and Dr. Lu Anming of the Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of
              Sciences.  This project will study the origins and evolution of major
              characteristic elements and key taxa in East Asian Flora.  Both the U.S. and
              Chinese researchers are outstanding in the field of paleobotany.  This project
              includes training opportunities for both U.S. and Chinese students, and can
              advance our understanding of the origins and direction of migration of many
              groups of once widespread plants that are now restricted to eastern Asia.  The
              Chinese Academy of Science, the Natural Science Foundation of China and the NSF
              jointly support this project.
