Abstract    :
              0074653  Miller  The proposed research centers on the need to better understand
              the impact of bioaerosols on public health.  Bioaerosols are airborne particles
              that are living or originated from once-living organisms.  The complexity of
              this problem warrants a multidisciplinary approach, combining expertise in
              environmental engineering and microbiology.  The project consists of two
              synergistic components.  In the first component, the PI will gain expertise in
              microbiology through a combination of course work in environmental
              microbiology, a lab-based certification program in Public Health Microbiology,
              and supporting laboratory activities.  In the second component, the PI will
              conduct research with the support of established experts.  The objective of the
              research is to collect and assay air and settled house dust samples for
              endotoxin and gram-negative bacteria from homes.  This research is based on the
              hypothesis that air samples are a better correlate with human exposure to
              airborne allergens compared to house dust samples.  House dust samples are
              easier to collect and have been used extensively in previous asthma
              evaluations.  Results will support epidemiological studies of the causes of
              increasing asthma rates in children.  Support will be used to conduct
              exploratory work to determine the feasibility of a research thrust in
              bioaerosols.  The PI has a strong background in engineering and will gain
              access to new skills and expertise in bioaerosols through this award, allowing
              her to become an independent researcher in a new area of inquiry at a
              relatively early stage in her career. ***
