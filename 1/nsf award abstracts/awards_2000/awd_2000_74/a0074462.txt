This project will survey the current status of the flora and
              fauna of Isla Guadalupe, Mexico, a national wildlife reservation established in
              1922.  Isla Guadalupe has a 10 million year history separated from the North
              American continent, and represents one of the most pristine habitats of the
              coastal biota of the Eastern Tropical Pacific.  Researchers will investigate
              the status of land and seabird species, insect and arthropod populations,
              survey plants, search for secretive reptiles and amphibians, and inventory the
              status and abundance of threatened species, including several thought to be
              extinct.  The research team will include US and Mexican researchers, and
              comprise experts representing vascular and non-vascular plants, insects and
              other invertebrates, fish, mammals, and birds.
