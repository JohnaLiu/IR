The goal of this proposal is
              to fabricate high density microchannels by using a novel air-gap technology. 
              By incorporating a polymeric material in silicon, the PI plans to form
              microchannels by thermally decomposing the polymeric material.  The channels
              could be used as microfluidic devices, microreactors or sites for microcatalyst
              deposition.  As a site for catalyst deposition, the fabrication of a chip for
              combinatorial catalysis should be possible.  By premixing catalyst particles in
              the polymer, catalyst composition can be controlled so that varied catalyst
              compositions can be deposited as part of a large library.  Several in-situ
              methods for controlling the catalyst composition will be tested.  If in situ
              techniques prove unworkable, the deposition of varied catalysts can be
              accomplished through evaporation of water from salt solutions in the formed
              channels.  Chemical composition of the resulting catalysts will be determined
              through XPS and FTIR analysis. This work may lead to new fabrication techniques
              for the production of structures useful in engineered microdevices.
