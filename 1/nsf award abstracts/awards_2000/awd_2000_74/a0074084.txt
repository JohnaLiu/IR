This research measures precise differential
              arrival times between similar earthquakes earthquakes using waveform
              cross-correlation.  These precise measurements are used to estimate accurate
              relative event locations.  Rather than estimate absolute hypocentral location,
              the method solves for the vector position difference between earthquake
              hypocenters.  In doing so one is able to reduce dramatically errors in
              earthquake locations.  The technique is currently being extended to work with
              much larger data sets, up to ~100,000 earthquakes, using both a hierarchical
              inversion scheme.  This capability to address a number of research issues,
              including:  what is the origin of recently discovered seismicity streaks in
              fault zones? What is the state of stress in close proximity to major faults? 
              What constraints can be placed on strain localization as a fault zone matures? 
              What can we learn about the time-dependent nature of friction on faults at
              depth?  How is seismicity related to regions of aseismic versus seismic slip?
