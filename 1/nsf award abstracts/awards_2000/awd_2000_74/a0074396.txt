Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology
              for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Population
              Biology and is entitled "Evolution of Wolbachia pipientis Substitution Rates
              and Phenotypic Variants".  This research seeks to measure the rate and mode of
              evolutionary change in Wolbachia, a bacterium that lives intracellularly in
              multiple tissues of various arthropods, and identify the selective forces that
              mediate persistence of different Wolbachia phenotypic variants in populations. 
              Specifically, the aims are to address 1. Whether or not modification and rescue
              variants of Wolbachia are maintained in populations as part of an evolutionary
              cycling scenario, and 2. If the rate and pattern of Wolbachia evolution suggest
              a small effective population size for the symbiont.
