Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology
              for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Microbial
              Genetics and is entitled "Mechanism of Homologous Recombination in Archaea". 
              This research examines general recombination mechanisms in the
              hyperthermophilic archaeal microbe Solfolobus solfataricus.  Functional
              homologues to eukaryotic recombination proteins are being heterologously
              produced and are used to reconstitute archaeal recombination in-vitro.  In-vivo
              gene disruption and mutant rescue studies will complement the in-vitro data and
              demonstrate functional homology of proteins produced by S. solfataricus to
              those produced in yeasts. Homologous recombination is a universal process in
              which genetic information is exchanged between separate strands of DNA,
              introducing new linkages and genetic sequences.
