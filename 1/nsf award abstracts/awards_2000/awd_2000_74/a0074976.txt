Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop a low-cost, robust, automated on-line
              monitoring system, which controls the painting process based, in part, upon
              perceived surface appearance.  This program will focus on the following
              objectives: determination of an efficient way to integrate human perception
              into a vision system hardware and software design which uses reflectance models
              as a rational basis; an investigation of the best image attributes and
              processing techniques to exploit the link between this vision system and
              perceived surface appearance; and prototype development of an expert system
              within the vision system software which facilitates as assessment of surface
              quality based on captured image data.  The project utilizes a four-prong
              approach, which includes small-scale experiments, simulation, prototype testing
              and on-site testing in parallel with existing methods.  This effort will expand
              the small-scale setup and use simulation to develop a methodology for capturing
              images and obtaining and analyzing derived attributes which are readily
              interpreted by both system software and line operators.

This research should
              provide direction to a more robust method to characterize, monitor and control
              surface quality.  The educational plan for the program includes collaborative,
              hands-on research experiences and mentoring for a diverse population, and
              enhancement of the principal investigator's ability to build and maintain a
              competitive research program, which attracts a well-prepared, diverse group of
              students.
