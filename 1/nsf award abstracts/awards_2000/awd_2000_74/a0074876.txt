The PI proposes a study of how
              introductions of exotic species and water extraction affect food webs of desert
              springs.  She will use stable isotopes of carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen to
              compare food web structure and energy flow in pristine vs. altered pools to
              test the predictions that 1) invading species have changed energy flow through
              food webs by forcing native species to shift their diets, and 2) water
              extraction has reduced the littoral margins of select pools thereby reducing
              habitat for insects and other soft invertebrates causing native fish species to
              feed more on algae and lower quality detritus.  This is the first time stable
              isotopes have been applied directly to a conservation issue in Cuatro Cienegas
              (Mexico) which is the site for the research.  The POWRE award will allow the PI
              to develop a long term research program with integrates ecology, conservation,
              and management.  This will enhance her research career as she returns to
              academia after a 3 year leave as AAAS fellow.
