ABSTRACT:
From a north-south line that bifrucates
              Nevada to the present-day coast, the continental crust of western North America
              has been constructed by the repeated accretion of tectonic terrains. One of
              those events was the emplacement of the Golconda Allochthon (GA) which is
              widely regarded as the principal structural expression of the Late Permian to
              earliest Triassic (approx. 240 million years ago) Sonoma Orogeny. A critical
              evaluation of available timing constraints, however, indicates that
              east-directed emplacement of the GA may have occurred as late as the Middle
              Jurassic - perhaps 75 My after the Sonoma event.  Confident interpretation of
              the role of the GA in the late Paleozoic to Mesozoic history of western North
              America awaits clarification of key field relationships and more precise age
              control of igneous plutons and volcano-sedimentary rocks that constrain the age
              of the Golconda Thrust.  Proposed research will evaluate this hypothesis
              through a combination of: 1) targeted field mapping to clarify critical field
              relations; 2) structural/kinematic analysis to establish the transport
              direction of the Golconda Thrust; 3) U-Pb geochronology to precisely date
              Mesozoic plutons that either cut, or are cut by the Golconda Thrust; and 4)
              whole-rock isotope geochemistry to compare initial isotopic ratios of Mesozoic
              plutons within the GA to those of plutons in the adjacent structural basement. 
              If valid, a Jurassic age of Golconda thrusting would significantly impact
              current interpretations of the late Paleozoic and Mesozoic tectonic evolution
              of western North America.
