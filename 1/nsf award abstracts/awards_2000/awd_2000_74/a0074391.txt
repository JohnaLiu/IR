Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology
              for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Biomolecular
              Processes and is entitled "Understanding Bacterial Injection of DNA into Other
              Cells".  The bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens injects DNA into plant cells
              via a type IV transporter "syringe", transforming the plant and creating a more
              favorable habitat for itself.  Type IV transporters are multi-protein,
              bacterial membrane-associated complexes that attach to the recipient cell and
              bring it into close proximity with the host.  They have not been well studied. 
              This research examines the protein-protein interactions involved in type IV
              transporters using yeast two-hybrid assays and will construct a high-resolution
              protein map and determine the specific amino acid residues required for
              interaction.  The functional significance of the peptide interactions will be
              confirmed in-vivo, and conservation of the peptide functions in other
              transporter systems will be examined.  This research may be valuable to genetic
              engineering for industrial and agricultural uses, as well as identification of
              targets for disease intervention.
