Abstract    :
              his proposal is a request for funds for participant support costs related to a
              workshop on "Biome and Latin American Pollen Database."  This is a meeting of
              pollen experts to facilitate inclusion of Latin American scientists in a
              component of a global pollen database effort.  It is crucial for the Latin
              American Pollen Database in particular, and the Global Pollen Database in
              general, that Latin American scientists be involved in the compilation efforts.
