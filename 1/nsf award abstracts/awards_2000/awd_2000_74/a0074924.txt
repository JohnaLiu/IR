Abstract    :
              Motivated by theoretical as well as major practical interests, new and powerful
              tools have been developed in the last decade for understanding  local
              properties of differential operators near singularities.  The  proposed
              research uses recent techniques and results of exponential asymptotics to
              address questions in the classification of ordinary  differential equations in
              singular regions, as well as analytic  properties of partial differential
              operators.  Among the questions  addressed are: (1a) finding necessary and
              sufficient criteria for an  ordinary differential equation whose linear part
              has several regular  singular points and is homogeneous, to be analytically
              equivalent to  its linear part (in a domain which contains the singular
              points); (1b)  finding necessary criteria for a nonlinear equation to be
              analytically  equivalent to its linear (inhomogeneous) part in a neighborhood
              of one  irregular singular point of rank 1; (2) finding necessary
              and
sufficient conditions for analytic hypoellipticity of partial 
              differential operators of type ``sum of squares'', with special focus on 
              Treves' conjecture.
