Abstract    :
              This POWRE award by the Chemistry Division will support Dr. Elena Galoppini in
              establishing a collaboration with professor Gerald Meyer of Johns Hopkins to
              synthesize a new class of coordination compounds and use them to study the
              dynamics of electron injection at the interface of Titantium Dioxide
              nanoparticles. The results obtained are  expected to contribute to better
              understanding of the photophysics of semiconducting nanoparticles and
              dye-sensitized regenerative solar cells as well as contribute to knowledge of
              the materials chemistry of polymeric light emitting diodes, sensors and other
              information storage devices.

Both graduate and undergraduate students will
              receive interdisciplinary training in both organic synthesis and photophysical
              and photoelectrochemical methods for study of semiconductors and Dr. Galoppini
              will integrate the subject matter into an undergraduate course. This award will
              permit Dr. Galoppini to access new techniques and facilities such as surface
              attachment of complexes, preparation of sol-gel Titantium Dioxide films and
              electrochemical cells, steady state and time-resolved spectroscopic studies,
              etc. and to implement them at her home institution.
