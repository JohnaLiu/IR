High pressure silicate and titanate crystals are
              being grown using a multianvil apparatus at pressures from 5 GPa to over 20
              GPa, and the structures solved using single-crystal x-ray diffraction, in order
              to understand more about how the atomic structures of rock-forming minerals
              change during high pressure phase transitions in the Earth's mantle.  The
              targets in this study include magnesium- and calcium-bearing silicates and
              titanates with H2O and/or fluorine, and so the basic idea is to extend the
              understanding of minerals under pressure to include more diverse compositions
              than are currently understood.  The study takes advantage of the multianvil
              facility at Arizona State University for high pressure synthesis, along with a
              new single-crystal x-ray diffractometer installed in the Chemistry Department.
              New methods of crystal growth, in particular the growth of large crystals using
              unusual high pressure liquids such as molten Ca(OH)2 as a growth medium, are
              being used to produce the samples.  Also, in some cases the samples must be
              recovered in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees Centigrade), because they will not
              survive decompression at room temperature.  Materials such as CaSiO3 perovskite
              behave this way, and this material in particular will be targeted for this type
              of treatment.  The crystals will be transferred over to the diffractometer
              cold, and the diffractometer has a liquid nitrogen attachment so the sample
              stays cold while it is studied. The knowledge of the existence of these high
              pressure silicates and their atomic structures will be used to help understand
              what happens to elements in the Earth's mantle; what kind of structures they
              can occur in, and how they might be transported during dynamic processes.
