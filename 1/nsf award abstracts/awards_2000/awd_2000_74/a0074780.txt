Abstract    :
              The focus of the proposed research of this POWRE award is for the PI to acquire
              new experimental skills and a broad-based knowledge of molecular biology.  The
              PI proposes to accomplish this by working in the laboratory of her
              collaborator, Dr. D. A. notterman, in the Department of Molecular Biology,
              Princeton University.  There, she will focus her efforts toward integrating
              nanotechnology with molecular biology.  Specifically, she will be developing an
              integrated microchip which, using a combination of microfluidic channels and
              nanoelectrodes, can measure the dielectric properties of single cells. 
              Correlations between these dielectric properties and the DNA content of cells
              will be examined.  Since DNA-content analysis and related measurements, such as
              the determination of S-phase fraction, are potentially useful strategies for
              detecting cancer cells, the proposed device will be an "on-chip" detector of
              cancer cells.  The PI will be learning how to culture and manipulate cells for
              this project.
