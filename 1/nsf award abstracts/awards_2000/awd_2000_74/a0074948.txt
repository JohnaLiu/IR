Abstract    :
              Various persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are suspected of undergoing
              atmospheric transport to regions far removed from the area of initial release.
              The objective of this POWRE research project is to develop a technique for
              distinguishing such long-range from short-range sources of POPs, based on the
              fractionation of stable isotopes during transport.  This project is a
              feasibility study using a model POP, the pesticide gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane,
              which is used in various low latitude source regions and has been shown to be
              abundant in polar regions.  The approach will be to conduct a tracer release
              experiment using isotopically-labelled (13C and 2H) gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane
              in order to examine its isotopic fractionation during transport.
