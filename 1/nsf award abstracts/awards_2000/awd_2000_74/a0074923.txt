Titan is the largest moon of the planet Saturn. 
              Titan's surface will be explored using a. powerful combination of high spatial
              and spectral resolution imaging in wavelength region heretofore unexplored from
              the Earth. The methane absorption in Titan's atmosphere results in atmospheric
              "windows" between ~ 0.83 and 2 microns wavelength where the absorption of the
              methane molecule is low, allowing the surface of Titan to be probed.  Previous
              spatially resolved imaging of Titan's surface revealed discrete bright and dark
              regions, which imply that Titan is not covered with a global hydrocarbon ocean
              as had been previously suggested.  An acousto-optic tunable filter camera,
              which has higher spec-tral resolution than narrow-band filters and the ability
              to tune to any wavelength between 0.5 - 1.05 microns, was used to make
              observations of the image of Titan in the 0.94 micron atmospheric window. 
              These observations were made in the fall of 1999 from the Mount Wilson
              Observatory 100-inch telescope, which is equipped with an adaptive optics
              system that allowed for high spatial resolution imaging of Titan's disk.   The
              fall 1999 observations covered one hemisphere of Titan, and a second set 0f
              observations is planned for the Fall of 2000 that will cover the opposite
              hemisphere.  Thus a complete mapping of Titan's surface will be possible.  Both
              data sets will be reduced and modeled in the same manner to yield information
              about the reflectivity, of' Titan's surface in the 0.9 micron wavelength
              window. When compared with results of other investigators looking in longer
              wavelength regions near-infrared atmospheric windows, the spectral dependence
              of Titan's bright and dark regions will be revealed.  This will provide new
              insight into the composition of Titan's surface, which will be a. timely result
              in anticipation of the Cassini/Huygens satellite probe mission to Titan in
              2004.  The participation of a graduate and undergraduate student in all levels
              of the research will enhance science education at New Mexico Stale University,
              a minority univer-sity.
