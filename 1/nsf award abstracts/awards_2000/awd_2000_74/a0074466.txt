Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              Population Biology and is entitled "Maximum likelihood estimates of the rate of
              occurrence of selected sweeps and of the time to the last selective event in
              the history of a sample".  The rapid fixation of strongly favored mutations, or
              selective sweeps, is thought to be a common mechanism by which adaptive
              evolution occurs.  For example, humans and chimpanzees differ by only 2% on the
              DNA level, yet it is this minute genotypic difference that confers enormous
              differences in phenotype, such as enhanced communication (speech) and
              cognition.  It is suggested that this fact can be attributed to the occurrence
              of selective sweeps/directional selection of genes that already existed rather
              than creation of novel genes unique to humans.  This research, aims to use
              computationally-intensive full likelihood methods to estimate the rate of
              occurrence of adaptive fixations and the time to the last favored substitution
              in order to identify these genes in humans.
