Abstract    :
              The Second Gordon Research Conference on Materials Education is held in
              Plymouth, NH, from July 30 to August 2, 2000.  The conference has as its main
              focus the contents and design of a Materials Curriculum, predominantly at the
              undergraduate level.  This includes a discussion of the ABET-2000 new
              accreditation system for engineering schools, student learning styles and
              portfolios, desirable skills of students from the academic and industrial
              perspectives, and how to design a new curriculum.  The conference encourages
              participation of faculty from predominantly undergraduate institutions.
