Abstract    :
              The PI (Chanyoung Lee Shader) will use her POWRE award to enhance her research
              and teaching with the following projects and activities:

(1) visit
              Professors Georgia Benkart and Arun Ram at the University of Wisconsin-Madison
              to continue the joint research in Combinatorial Representation Theory of Lie
              Superalgebras, and to learn new projects
and techniques in the related areas
              of research; 
(2) travel to conferences and  pursue joint research projects 
              with several researchers in representation theory of associative and
              nonassociative algebras;
(3) participate and learn from the VIGRE project at
              the University of Wisconsin ways to enhance her teaching in Combinatorics and
              Algebra courses at her home institution, University of Wyoming.  

This POWRE
              project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
              (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
