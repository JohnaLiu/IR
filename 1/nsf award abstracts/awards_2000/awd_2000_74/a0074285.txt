The elastic properties of silicate melt and its
              structure provides insight into not only magmatic processes in the Earth but
              also into the possible origin of the planet's primordial stratification. This
              project will study the elastic and structural properties of simple (binary)
              alkali silicate and germanate melts under in-situ high pressure and temperature
              conditions in the externally heated diamond-anvil cell. The elastic properties
              will be investigated by Brillouin spectroscopy (light-scattering technique); a
              newly developed "modified" platelet scattering geometry will be employed. In
              conjunction with the Brillouin measurements, Raman studies will be conducted to
              correlate the measured elastic properties with the structure of the melt.
              



The Brillouin and Raman studies will be conducted on alkali silicates
              and germinates with a range of cation sizes and different degrees of melt
              polymerization. As such, the investigators anticipate that their data will
              constrain the structural systematics of the melt elasticity and pressure, and
              this will in turn provide insight into the role of pressure-induced changes in
              melt structure in altering melt compressibility at depth in the Earth's
              interior.
