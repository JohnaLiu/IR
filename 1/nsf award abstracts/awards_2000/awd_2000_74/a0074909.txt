POWRE:
              Probabilistic Methods for Concurrency

                                     
              
 The main objective of this proposal is to develop a probabilistic concurrent
              calculus, which is the study of its semantics, and formal methods for reasoning
              with implementation. Furthermore, such calculus will be used as an intermediate
              level for the implementation of the pi-calculus, a powerful formalism for the
              specification of concurrent systems with link mobility.
