Abstract    :
              This POWRE award by the Chemistry Division will support Dr. Jeanne M. Hossenlopp
              in developing the materials science aspects of her research in thin film
              deposition and characterization at Marquette University. The proposed work will
              result in an apparatus to measure the electrical properties of thin films
              exposed to volatile organic vapors under atmospheric conditions. In addition
              new procedures will be developed for deposition of tin oxide films using laser
              assisted chemical vapor deposition. Both graduate and undergraduate students
              will participate in this work and learn the  fundamentas of gas sensor material
              chemistry thereby providing them with an integrative understanding of this area
              of science from both the materials and environmental science perspectives.
