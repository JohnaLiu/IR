POWRE:
              Self-Assembling Graphs by DNA

This POWRE award will support research on a
              new way of solving computational problems using three-dimensional DNA
              structures.  An experiment for solving a computational problem, the so called
              three-vertex colorability problem for graphs, by actually constructing a
              three-dimensional DNA graph structure is proposed.  This is an initial study
              towards developing computational methods using three-dimensional DNA structures
              such as graphs that are not available with current electronic computers. The
              project proposes use of branched junction molecules to build graphs by DNA. 
              The project will provide a better understanding of the topology of DNA, which
              leads to a more profound understanding of natural processes in vivo.
