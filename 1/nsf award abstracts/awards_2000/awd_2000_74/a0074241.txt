Abstract    :
              The ultimate goal of this project is to understand that interfacial behavior and
              microstructure of monodendrons in order to immobilize these molecules on an
              interface.  The PI is going to screen various molecular parameters including a
              generation number of monodendrons, type of terminal groups, spacer length,
              nature of anchoring groups, and type of functionalized substrates in a search
              for stable organized interfacial assemblies.  These dendrimer macromolecules
              could be capable of forming organized and stable supramolecular structures at
              interfaces with the focal anchoring group used for chemical binding to
              functionally modified surfaces.  Interfacial ordering and surface behavior at
              air-liquid, air-solid, and liquid-solid interfaces will be studied by Langmuir
              techniques, chemical and electrostatic self-assembly in conjunction with
              comprehensive characterization with ellipsometry, X-ray scattering, UV
              spectroscopy, and scanning probe microscopy.

This project focuses on the
              nanotechnology for fabrication of nanocomposite films with molecularly tailored
              surface properties from dendrimers.  Dendrimer polymers with a tree-like
              architecture are promising candidates for functional supramolecular materials
              with prospective applications in the fields of drug delivery, molecular
              coatings, nanochemistry, molecular composites, and light harvesting.  A
              critical step in the development of such applications is the understanding of
              how these macromolecules can be anchored to solid substrates in a controllable
              manner.
