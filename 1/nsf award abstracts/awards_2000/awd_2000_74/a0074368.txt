Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology
              for FY 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Metabolic
              Biochemistry and is entitled "Experimental Studies of Hydrogen-producing
              Bacteria."  Hydrogen is a key intermediate in anaerobic environments and is
              maintained at low concentration by microbial competition.  This research uses a
              novel hydrogen-removal system to study the physiology and bioenergetics of
              obligately hydrogen-producing bacteria in pure culture.  Studies focus on
              metabolism of important substrates, i.e., acetate, benzoate, amino acids, and
              glycolate.  Enrichment and isolation procedures for anaerobic bacteria are also
              being developed.   Hydrogen metabolism in bacteria is not well-understood but
              plays an important role in microbial diversity in the environment.
