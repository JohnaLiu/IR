Abstract    :
              
This Symposium on "Structural Aspects of Protein Synthesis" is an
              interdisciplinary meeting which aims to provide a forum for discussion and
              informal exchange among scientists from different backgrounds, on the theme of
              ribosome structure and its dynamic changes and interactions with ligands during
              protein synthesis.  The goal is to understand the molecular basis of protein
              synthesis as a dynamic process, and its regulation within the cells, based on
              recent results of structural research.   As the structure is determined to
              atomic resolution, the structure of the ribosome components are solved, and
              dynamic information is available from cryo-EM, a reinterpretation of much of
              the experimental information toward a dynamic model of protein synthesis is
              possible.  The format of the conference will provide for formal and informal
              exchange of information and ideas among scientists that is not possible in
              large meetings.    All participants will be invited to submit abstracts of
              posters, and a website address will be distributed to the scientific community.
                Final abstracts of presentation and posters will be placed on the website
              enabling wider distribution.
