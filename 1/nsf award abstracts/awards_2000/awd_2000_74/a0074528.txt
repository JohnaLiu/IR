Rapid advances have been made in quantum dot (QD) crystal
              growth and device design to produce lower threshold current density and
              improved temperature stability in QD semiconductor lasers compared to quantum
              well (QW) lasers.  It is also becoming evident that the QD will have
              technologically important applications such as extended wavelength (1.0 mm- 1.3
              mm) operation of GaAs-based lasers and lateral electronic carrier confinement
              important for microcavity applications such as low power VCSELs and photonic
              bandgap defect lasers.  Receiving increased attention are lasers and
              photodetectors operating in the far infrared based on intersubband QD
              transitions.  One of the problems in advancing QD technology, especially at 1.3
              mm, is the small gain in the QD active region compared to the QW. A solution to
              this problem is to stack the QD layers; however, there is a severe limitation
              on the amount of strained material which can be utilized in the
              epitaxy.

This project will study the development of stacked quantum dot
              active regions which include strain compensating layers to balance the
              accumulated strain of the QD stacks.  The use of strain-compensating layers is
              well known in the field of strained multiple quantum well lasers, however it
              has not yet been investigated for stacked quantum dot active regions.  This
              presents a great opportunity for new experiments in both materials and devices.
               The project includes the crystal growth of multiple compressively strained
              InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot active layers separated by tensile strained InGa(As)P
              layers.  The active regions will be studied through X-Ray diffraction and
              photoluminescence to optimize material parameters.  Although the work is
              applicable to all types of QDs formed by strained layer epitaxy, this project
              will focus primarily on QDs which emit at the 1.3 mm wavelength.  These active
              regions are applicable to monolithic 1.3 mm GaAs-based VCSELs which are
              important for signal transmission through silica fibers.
