Abstract    :
                   The investigators develop very efficient adaptive
discontinuous Galerkin
              (DG) methods for transient hyperbolic and
singularly perturbed
              convection-diffusion problems.  These
methods use discontinuous bases and thus
              are very effective at
capturing discontinuities.  In addition, they simplify
              adaptive
h-, p-, and hp-refinement, are simple to implement on
unstructured
              meshes with irregular boundaries, parallelize very
well, and satisfy local
              (element level) conservation principles.
Adaptive enrichment by h-, p-, and
              r-refinement or combinations
thereof has typically been guided by a posteriori
              estimates of
discretization errors.  The investigators study
              asymptotically
correct error estimates of discretization errors under h-
              or
p-refinement that provide very reliable measures of solution
accuracy.  A
              posteriori error estimates are developed for linear
and nonlinear hyperbolic
              and singularly perturbed
convection-diffusion problems.  The investigators
              implement these
DG methods for large-scale problems on modern parallel
              systems
ranging from advanced supercomputers to clusters of
              workstations.
Parallel procedures must address heterogeneity at the
              processor,
memory, and communications levels as adaptivity
              greatly
complicates matters.  A balanced parallel computation may cease
to
              remain so under adaptive h- or p-refinement.  Computational
loads must
              dynamically be redistributed during the solution
process to restore and
              maintain balance.  Procedures to migrate
work between the processors so as to
              minimize the computational
time have hardly been addressed in such a
              heterogeneous
environment.
     Complex realistic computer simulations of
              physical problems
like the flow about a vehicle, weather prediction, and
              materials
processing require long times on the fastest supercomputers. 
              The
investigators develop very efficient and reliable
              computational
techniques based on the discontinuous Galerkin method that
              should
have advantages for parallel and network computation.  Accuracy
and
              reliability of the results are guided by estimates of
solution errors that are
              automatically obtained as part of the
computation.  These are used to create
              adaptive procedures that
assign computational resources to regions where they
              are needed
most.  The efficiency provided by adaptivity leads to
              more
accurate computer simulations, better products, and shorter
design
              cycles.
