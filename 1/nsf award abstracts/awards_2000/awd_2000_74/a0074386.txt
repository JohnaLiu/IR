Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology
              for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Microbial
              Genetics and is entitled "Characterization of a Second Circadian Oscillator in
              Synechococcus sp. Strain PCC 7942".  The single-celled cyanobacterium,
              Synechococcus sp. Strain PCC 7942 has a circadian pacemaker or "clock"
              consisting of at least three genes (kaiA, kaiB, and kaiC) that has an
              endogenous period of 25 hours.  A second, mutant clock with a 27.5-hour period
              has been shown in the sigC mutant of Synechococcus.  While experiments have
              shown kaiA in this mutant to oscillate with the 27.5 hour period, kaiB exhibits
              the wild-type 25 hour periodicity, leading to the hypothesis that there is an
              unforeseen oscillator (UFO) present that is overruled under wild-type (i.e.
              normal) conditions by the master Kai oscillator.  This research physiologically
              characterizes the 27.5-hour oscillation of strain PCC 7942 by examining its
              temperature compensation and ability to phase reset.  In addition, the
              molecular basis of the 27.5-hour UFO and its effects on synechococcal circadian
              gene expression is investigated.
