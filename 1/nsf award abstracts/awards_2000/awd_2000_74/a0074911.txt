Abstract    :
              This POWRE project designs and implements prototype software that integrates
              database management and geographic information for the purpose of monitoring
              and forecasting the distribution of environmental pollutants.  Mercury
              contamination, which has been identified as a significant environmental threat
              both in Massachusetts and across the nation, serves as the initial focus of
              this project.  Specifically, this project develops technology that enables
              effective collection and rapid processing and interpretation of vast quantities
              of complex data relating to diverse environmental pollutants.  This POWRE award
              is used specifically to enable the investigator to partner with environmental
              biologists from governmental organizations and computer scientists from a
              commercial organization, leading to significant professional advancement of the
              investigator.  In addition, the award supports the investigator's study of new
              methods of environmental monitoring and forecasting over a relatively short
              period of time with the long-term goal of establishing academic leadership in
              the field of environmental conservation.
