              ABSTRACT
Collaborative Investigation: Tectonogenesis of the Khoy ophiolite, NW.
              Iran 

Ghazi and Pessagno

This proposal is a collaborative investigation
              that focuses on the planktonic foraminiferal biostratigraphy, radiolarian
              biostratigraphy, choronostratigraphy and microfacies analysis of sedimentary
              rocks occurring within and above the extrusive member of the Khoy ophiolite. 
              The Khoy ophiolite of northwestern Iran is one of the largest and least studied
              Iranian ophiolites.  Moreover, it is superbly exposed with most geologic
              elements representing pre-, syn-, and post emplacement events (units) well
              preserved.  The Khoy ophiolite is located at a junction where the Iranian and
              other Middle Eastern ophiolites are connected to the Turkish and Mediterranean
              ophiolites.  The integration of the data resulting from the proposed
              collaborative effort coupled with geochemical, Pb-Nd-Sr isotopic and 40Ar-39Ar
              results generated by the Co-Principle investigator A. Mohamad Ghazi
              (EAR-9903249) should lead to a better understanding of the tectonogenesis of
              the Khoy ophiolite and to determine whether it is indeed a part of the Tethyan
              oceanic crust and is a part of the postulated ridge-transform fault system
              spreading axis that existed in Cretaceous southern Tethys ocean.  The project
              is funded with participation from the Division of International Programs.
