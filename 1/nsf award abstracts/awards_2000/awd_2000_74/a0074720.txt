Abstract    :
              An exploratory research program is planned to develop and assess through the
              thickness stitching of composite sandwich structures. We will explore the
              feasibility and potential benefits obtained by stitching foam core sandwich
              panels with Kevlar yarns.  To offer low cost manufacturing, we propose to
              manufacture stitched sandwich panels using low-cost, out-of-autoclave
              processing.  Sandwich panels will be stitched in a dry perform state, vacuum
              bagged, and infiltrated using Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Modeling (VARTM)
              processing.  The through-the-thickness stitches will provide resin infusion
              paths to the facesheet adjacent to the tool surface.  Evaluation will focus
              initially on performing standardized ASTM tests on the stitched sandwich panels
              and comparing results with comparable unstitched panels.  Additional
              specialized tests will be performed to evaluate the increase in damage
              tolerance provided by the Kavlar stitched.  Finally. We will explore finite
              element based analysis methodologies that may be used to design optimized
              stitching configurations for specific applications.  If we are successful in
              this exploratory research, we will demonstrate that stitched sandwich
              structures offer a significant increase in damage tolerance and interlaminar
              strength while allowing for low cost processing.
