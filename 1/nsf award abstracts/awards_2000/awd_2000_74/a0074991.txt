Abstract    :
              In the fall of 2001, MSRI will hold a special program on "Integral Geometry and
              Represntation Theory."  I was invited to be a co-organizer of this program.  I
              am confident that this program will have valuable impact in the development and
              "recapture" of some important analytic problems in representation theory and
              its applications.  For this reason, I would like to spend the whole semester at
              MSRI.  The POWRE grants will give me that opportunity.  My research activities
              will consist of four concrete problems in topics related to the MSRI program on
              which I'll be working.

This POWRE project is jointly supported by the MPS
              Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical
              Sciences (DMS).
