Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology
              for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Biomolecular
              Processes and is entitled "Elements Required for Protein Synthesis in Archaea".
               This research focuses on post-transcriptional modifications of the archaeon
              Methanococcus jannaschii.  This research provides an understanding of the role
              of tRNA modifications in the archaeal adaptation to extreme environments.  A
              variety of approaches are used to identify modifications that are important for
              tRNAs in protein synthesis.  The archaeal mechanism of protein synthesis and
              its differentiation from those of Eubacteria and Eukarya will be
              investigated.
