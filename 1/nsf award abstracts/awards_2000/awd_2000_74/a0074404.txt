Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology
              for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Metabolic
              Biochemistry and is entitled "Anaerobic Methane Oxidizers in Marine Microbial
              Mats".  Anaerobic methane oxidation (AMOX), a sink for greenhouse gas methane,
              is a microbially-mediated process of global ecological significance.  This
              research investigates the biology of microorganisms responsible for AMOX in
              marine microbial mats by using microelectrodes in conjunction with 16S
              rRNA-based techniques to monitor the organisms as they occur in their natural
              environments.  The data acquired from this research helps to determine if AMOX
              is mediated by a syntropic relationship between two microbial groups or by a
              single microbial group possessing an unknown biochemical pathway.
