Abstract    :
              Humphris/00-74846
This POWRE award provides funding to allow the PI to develop
              an expertise in MATLAB and to develop modules for her research needs. The PI
              has returned to a full-time research program after many years as an
              administrator and needs to acquire technical skills in data manipulation so
              that she can successfully analyze and visualize the complex datasets that her
              research generates. She would like to spend several short periods focussed on
              learning the software and data manipulation techniques during an 18-month
              period. Using these modeling tools, she will relate variations in the physical
              and chemical characteristics of hydrothermal fluids and the distribution and
              nature of hydrothermal precipitates to their geotectonic setting.
