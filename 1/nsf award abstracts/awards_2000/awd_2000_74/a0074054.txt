This project is to study the melting and
              physical properties of iron in the pressure range of 30 to 300 GPa. The new
              data will consist of melting of iron to the pressure of Earth's core,
              pressure-volume-temperature measurements (thermal expansion and compressibility
              as a function of temperature) and phase transformations of iron. The
              investigators will use laser-heating (double-sided) and external heating of
              diamond-anvil cells to achieve the pressure and temperature. The study will
              provide important experimental data to be used in understanding the thermal and
              dynamic aspects of Earth's core and assessing the thermodynamic database for
              modeling the temperature-density profiles in the core and at the core-mantle
              boundary.
