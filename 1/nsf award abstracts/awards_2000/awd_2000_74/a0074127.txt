It is critical to understand the evolution of
              bubble size distributions (BSD) during magmatic ascent in order to determine
              what the textural information from quenched pumice clasts tells us about the
              processes of magmatic degassing during explosive eruptions. Processes such as
              coalescence, Ostwald ripening, the effects of concentration gradients in the
              melt, and multiple nucleation events are all possible ways by which an
              initially uniform bubble size distribution derived from a single nucleation
              event may evolve into polymodal distributions more like that observed in pumice
              clasts. We propose here to experimentally quantify the rates and conditions
              under which these processes affect BSD's in rhyolitic and phonolitic melts at
              decompression rates, pressures, temperatures, and water contents applicable to
              magmatic ascent prior to the fragmentation limit. Our study will address the
              role that melt viscosity plays in the production of pumice vesicle size
              distributions by comparing results for natural high-silica rhyolite and
              phonolite compositions (h ~109 and 105 respectively). Our goal is to use these
              experiments to constrain pre-fragmentation effects at applicable conditions in
              order to better constrain how BSD modification may occur during eruptions to
              produce the VSD's present in quenched pumice. Our goal for this proposed work
              is an experimentally constrained model of the evolution of BSD's in ascending
              magma prior to fragmentation, and provide better constraints on the processes
              that contribute to vesicle size distributions observed in pumice.
