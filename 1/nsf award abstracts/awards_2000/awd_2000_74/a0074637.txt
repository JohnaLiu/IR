              PROJECT ABSTRACT:

The project proposed is for the development of
              computational methods in financial engineering.  Financial engineering deals
              broadly with the use of mathematical and computational tools  to model the
              dynamics of asset prices, to value and hedge derivative securities tied to the
              underlying assets, and to measure and control the risks associated with these
              instruments.  The project proposes three areas of investigation:  (1) a
              stochastic mesh method for solving high-dimensional stochastic dynamic
              programming problems embedded in certain financial engineering problems; (2)
              models and methods for incorporating jumps in diffusion-based models of the
              term structure of interest rates; (3) numerical methods for path-dependent
              options.

Research in financial engineering contributes to the
              competitiveness and soundness of the U.S. financial services industry.  The
              U.S. holds a leadership position in this important sector of the service
              economy; future preeminence in this industry will rely on innovation in
              financial services and in the technology that supports these services,
              including leading-edge computational methods for financial engineering and risk
              management.  This area employs highly skilled scientists and engineers; this
              project will contribute, in part, to the training of skilled personnel.
