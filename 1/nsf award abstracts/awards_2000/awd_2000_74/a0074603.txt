Cretaceous strata of the Caribbean region can provide a
              testing ground for studying macroevolutionary processes in a reef ecosystem of
              a greenhouse world.  Caribbean coral-algal systems were inherited from the
              Jurassic, and corals and rudists then co-inhabited the carbonate platforms;
              rudist bivalves eventually dominated many of the Caribbean platforms.  Middle
              Cretaceous coral and bivalve paleobiota from reefs in the core and northern
              margin of the tropics will be analyzed for taxonomic composition and
              morphologic characters.  The hypothesis to be addressed involves the mechanism
              of change in dominance of the two groups: is only the environment driving
              evolution, are there taxonomic, morphologic, and ecologic factors to consider,
              or is the change in dominance a macroevolutionary process involving both
              environment and the ecologic characteristics of the co-existence of the two
              groups?  The presence or absence of macroevolutionary trends noted from this
              study will be a substantial contribution to our knowledge of evolutionary
              processes operating in the tropics during a greenhouse world.  This study is
              appropriate for POWRE because funding opportunities for such work in order to
              research a fundamental question of evolutionary theory in the tropics: are
              macroevolutionary processes operative in the tropics during a greenhouse
              world?
