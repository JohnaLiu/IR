Abstract    :
              This POWRE award by the Chemistry Division will allow Dr. Susan Olesik of Ohio
              State University to apply her experience with supercritical and enhanced
              fluidity solvents in separations science to developing innovative polymer
              synthesis and processing systems. The precise control of intermolecular
              interactions, high diffusivity and low viscosities of such solvents allows the
              development of polymers with highly controllable mechanical and chemical
              properties for use as biocompatible materials, for separation of chiral
              pharmaceuticals, in sensors and in environmental remediation. Dr. Olesik has
              recently completed a sabbatical in industry where she learned synthetic and
              characterization procedures for polymers produced in supercritical solvents.
              This award will allow her to establish a new emphasis in her research and to
              train graduate students in the procedures she will be developing.
