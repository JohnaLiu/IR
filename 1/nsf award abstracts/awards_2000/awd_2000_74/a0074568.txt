Abstract    :
              This POWRE award by the Chemistry Division will extend a sabbatical leave for
              Dr. Helen Leung from her duties at Mount Holyoke College to spend a year in the
              Laboratory of Dr. Marsha Lester at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Leung
              will extend her work on weakly bound unreactive complexes to reactive complexes
              by learning to analyze the reaction dynamics of the latter class of materials,
              a field in which Dr. Lester is a leading researcher. She and Dr. Lester will
              establish a continuing collaboration in which Dr. Leung will apply the high
              sensitivity and high resolution of her Fourier Transform microwave
              spectrometers to the determination of geometry and energetics of reactive
              complexes thereby complementing Dr. Lester's laser studies. Dr. Lester will
              assist in the development and testing of a new source of the complexes which
              Dr. Leung will assemble and test in Dr. Lester's lab and take back to Mount
              Holyoke. Additional funds are awarded for development of this source as it is
              essential to sustaining the collaboration and developing a research program in
              reactive complexes at Mount Holyoke.

Dr. Leung will also use her time at
              Penn to discuss ways of increasing the involvement of Mount Holyoke
              undergraduates in research and of presenting the results of her research to
              undergraduates through the regular curriculum.
