Abstract    :
              This project involves systematic research on the use of information and
              communication technologies (ICTs) by transnational groups and individuals to
              forge interdependent, electronic networks of power to influence government
              policies and the response of governments to these networks in the age of
              information technology.  As countries explore the use of ICTs to maximize
              service delivery and facilitate economic competitiveness via electronic
              government, they must address balancing the expanded access of information
              technologies and the challenge to political rule.  The project will involve six
              steps: (1) identify and define three distinct populations that form
              transnational electronic networks; (2) introduce a theoretical model of
              electronic transnationalism; (3) conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses
              of ICT activities of the selected networks and the responses of governments to
              the networks; (4) construct a cyber-mapping or spatial analysis of ICT
              activities; (5) examine barriers to forging interdependent links in cyberspace
              and strategies to circumvent these barriers; and (6) create a typology of
              ICT-level of government and policy issues of electronic networks.

This
              project will contribute to the broader understanding of the formation of
              electronic networks, the monitoring and tracking of network activities, the use
              of new technologies by transnational groups to influence public policy and
              government practices, and the social and political factors shaping the advent
              of information technology.

The investigator's pursuit of a new educational
              direction that incorporates information technology into the classroom practice
              and course content has spawned an exciting, intense research agenda on the use
              of information and communication technologies by groups and individuals to
              influence government policies.  Through national and international conferences
              and other scholarly exchanges with academic peers, the researcher has been able
              to share preliminary findings on a theoretical model she has constructed to
              study the formation and role of transnational electronic networks.  To conduct
              the necessary empirical research to test the model, prepare the findings for
              scholarly dissemination via published papers, and move forward in this field of
              scientific inquiry, the researcher needs a twelve-month period of time to focus
              solely on research and writing.  A POWRE award will afford the researcher the
              time to dedicate her full priority to completing this research agenda and
              developing her credentials for full professor. With this award, the researcher
              seeks to intensify her research contribution to the scholarly community,
              enhance her status as a scientist in a newly emerging area of study, and
              strengthen her leadership role in a growing discipline in which women and
              minorities are underrepresented.
