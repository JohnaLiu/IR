Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              Population Biology  and is The Role of Alu Elements in Regulatory Evolution:
              Bioinformatic and Experimental Study".   About 10% of the human genome is
              composed of Alu elements, which are primate-specific SINES (short interspersed
              elements)--sequences of DNA thought to have been retroposed into the primate
              genome during evolutionary history.  The human lineage has thousands of recent
              Alu insertions that are not found in other hominoids.  Alu sequences have all
              been shown to have transcription factor binding sites.  Thus, it is possible
              that some of these elements, if inserted adjacent to genes, may have altered
              gene regulation underlying human evolution.  The aim of this study is to test,
              via molecular techniques and bioinformatic studies, the hypothesis that Alus
              preferentially insert predominantly near male germ cell transcribed genes.  The
              resulting analyses of human-specific SINES will help identify candidate genes
              that may be expressed differently in humans compared to other hominoids.
