Caroline S. Harwood
Dr. Caroline Harwood has been awarded a grant
              for an intensive six-and-a-half week summer course in Microbial Diversity to be
              given at The Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts in the
              years 2000 though 2003. There is general agreement in the scientific community
              that the continued expansion of biotechnology into the environmental,
              pharmaceutical and medical arenas depends on our ability to recognize and
              exploit the vast biodiversity of microbes that exist on earth.  The aim of the
              course is to train students to recognize and effectively study diverse kinds of
              new microorganisms. The course will be attended by graduate and postdoctoral
              students, as well as established investigators, who want to become competent in
              microbiological techniques for working with a broad range of microbes and in
              approaches for recognizing and understanding evolutionary relationships between
              microbes.  The course is primarily a laboratory course that will emphasize
              nature as the source of microorganisms for research; thus the beginner and the
              advanced student have equal chances to make discoveries.  Students will isolate
              various metabolic types of microbes and they will use molecular techniques,
              computer analysis and approaches of comparative genomics to mine the riches of
              diverse microbes. The laboratory component of the course will be complemented
              by lectures that provide theoretical background in metabolism, evolution and
              genomics.  A series of mini-symposia on current topics of interest in the areas
              of genomics and microbial evolution will also be given.
