The objective of this POWRE grant is for the PI to develop
              expertise in triple resonance multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
              methods to answer fundamental questions on the role of protein structure and
              dynamics in heme reactivity.  She will learn these techniques in the laboratory
              of a colleague at her institution. Heteronuclear NMR will enable her to
              determine the three dimensional structure of the protein as well as changes in
              atomic resolution dynamics and its role in redox based heme reactivity.   This
              laboratory is investigating the mechanism of iron release from heme by heme
              oxygenase.  This enzyme uses heme as the substrate and the prosthetic group. 
              This lab is particularly interested in determining the role the protein
              environment has in modulating the reactivity of the heme.  The information
              obtained from using heteronuclear NMR will expand knowledge in the protein
              structure as it relates to heme reactivity.
