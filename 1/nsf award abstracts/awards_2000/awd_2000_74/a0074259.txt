     The investigator studies the convergence, stability, and
              superconvergence of finite volume element type methods, and implements
              algorithms in software.  A general framework is developed for mixed control
              volume methods on irregular grids. Furthermore, nonlinear covolume methods
              applied to parabolic differential and integro-differential equations are
              studied.

     Fluid flow problems such as chemical or radioactive
              contaminant transport in subsurface reservoir flow, displacement of oil in the
              oil recovery process, and bioremediation of aquifers, are complex and difficult
              to simulate computationally.  Yet they are important for the environment and
              for managing energy resources.  The investigator develops, analyzes, and
              implements a class of computational methods called finite volume element
              methods that seem to have some advantages over other methods but that have not
              been rigorously analyzed yet.  The analysis undertaken in the project should
              establish a firm theoretical footing for the methods.  This is important for
              the reliability and validity of computations performed with the methods.
