Abstract    :
              Project research goals are to develop theoretical models and computer
              simulations that can pre-dict the properties of complex mixtures containing
              particulates, and thereby be able to guide ex-perimental efforts along more
              fruitful directions. The motion of particles influences the behavior of fluids,
              and the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the fluids in turn affect the
              movement of  particles. To accurately capture flow properties of complex fluids
              containing particles, hydro-dynamic interactions must be included in the
              description of the system. Currently, there are no ef-ficient methods for
              simulating hydrodynamic interactions in three dimensions for mixtures of
              multicomponent fluids and mobile, solid particles. To overcome this stumbling
              block and achieve prediction of properties of polymeric composites, the project
              is devoted to collaborative development of innovative computational techniques.

This is a research enhancement grant made under the Professional
              Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program. The project
              provides partial support for a sabbatical year which the PI will spend
              collaborating with Prof. Julia Yeomans at Oxford University, UK. The
              collaboration with Prof. Yeomans is expected to provide a unique opportunity
              for integrating the PI's experience in modeling polymer/particle mixtures with
              her expertise in modeling the hy-drodynamic behavior of fluids. In addition to
              research activities at Oxford, the PI will play an ac-tive role in mentoring
              students at St. Hilda's College, which is the only women's college in Ox-ford,
              and students associated with the Physics and Materials Departments. The project
              is co-supported by the Division of Materials Research, and the MPS OMA(Office
              of Multidisciplinary Activities).
