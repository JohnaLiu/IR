POWRE: Adsorption of Low Concentration Gaseous Mixtures

With
              the recognition that the air we breathe can adversely affect human health,
              there is increased interest in removing gaseous contaminants from indoor air by
              adsorption.  Indoor air may contain hundreds of volatile organic compounds
              (VOCs) as well as inorganic gases, such as ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen
              dioxide, in trace (parts-per-billion, ppb) concentrations.  The aim of this
              study is to explore the interactions between organic vapors and chemically
              reactive gases on an activated carbon adsorbent.  The dynamic adsorption of a
              gas/vapor mixture of two organic compounds from different chemical families
              (toluene and dichloromethane) and ozone will be measured.  Concentrations of
              the VOCs will be varied from 1 to 10 ppm.  The concentration of ozone will be
              varied from 100 ppb to 1 ppm.  Adsorbent capacities and equilibrium isotherms
              will be quantified for individual adsorbates and for several binary mixtures
              and one ternary mixture.  Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoemission
              spectrometry will be used to analyze the carbon surface before and after
              adsorption.  The presence of by-products will be assessed with mass
              spectrometry.  

These experiments will provide new data for mixed-component
              adsorption in a concentration range for which very few data exist. 
              Breakthrough curves and isotherm data for ozone and for the mixture of ozone
              and VOCs will be the first available.  The efficacy of predicting adsorption of
              mixtures using data obtained for the individual components will be appraised. 
              The experimental results will be compared with existing dynamic models for
              mixed-component adsorption. Predictive model comparisons will ultimately aid
              the development of design guidelines for adsorption systems for indoor air
              purification and similar applications, as in automobiles and aircraft cabins.
