The objective of this research is to test a major hypothesis
              that there are significant changes, during early postnatal development, in
              synaptic plasticity in a specific neuronal circuit, the first limb of the
              hippocampal trisynaptic circuit, in a brain structure intimately involved in
              learning and memory. It has been shown that hippocampal circuit responses to
              afferent input vary depending upon the frequency and pattern of the input. The
              response to certain patterns of activation of hippocampal afferent inputs may
              result in either enhancement (long-term potentiation (LTP)), or a diminishment
              (long-term depression (LTD)) of the hippocampal synaptic response. The
              phenomena of long-term potentiation and long-term depression have been
              extensively studied in adult animals, but the few studies which have examined
              the developmental onset and maturation of such neuroplastic responses have
              generally been carried out in vitro slice or anesthetized preparations. No such
              developmental study has been carried out in behaving animals; hence, the
              studies to be conducted are unique in this regard.

The major goal for the
              project is to apply recently developed surgical and recording techniques to
              quantify the ontogeny of frequency-dependent responses of the perforant
              path/dentate granule cell synapse in pre-weaning, freely moving male rats.
