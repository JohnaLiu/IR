The P.I. proposed a project to develop a
              molecular phylogeny of the North American firefly taxa to study the evolution
              of their light signals.  The proposed work has five parts: 1) develop a
              molecular phylogeny based on mitochondrial & nuclear genes of extant
              Lampyridae; 2) map phenotypic data (light color and signal patterns) onto the
              phylogenetic tree; 3) determine whether certain light colors and patterns can
              be traced to a single origin; 4) test specific hypotheses on light signal
              evolution; and 5) investigate the molecular basis of light color evolution in
              Lampyridae.  This PI will be able to initiate a new research program and this
              POWRE award will provide unique access to time and material for this project.
