This research project of Dr. Henry Dones, at the Southwest
              Research Institute, deals with the origin and evolution of the small satellites
              of the giant planets.  It concentrates on those objects that are believed to be
              collisional shards and those classified as irregular satellites.  These objects
              are not well understood, and yet the understanding of their origin and
              evolution will provide vital clues to the formation of the planets themselves. 
              In particular, the study of these small satellites could supply important
              insights into the accretion physics of icy bodies.  In addition, they could
              provide important constraints on the current and historical distribution of
              small bodies throughout the outer solar system.  These constraints can be used
              to better understand the ages of the surfaces of the major regular satellites,
              as well as the history of the Kuiper Belt and the scattered disk of comets
              beyond Neptune.  This award is made through the Planetary Astronomy
              Program.
