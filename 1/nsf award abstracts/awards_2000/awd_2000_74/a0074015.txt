The magnetic field of the Earth is created by
              electric currents flowing in the Earth's molten-iron core. These currents are
              generated by self-excited dynamo action. As in a power station, the motion of
              the conductor in the presence of the magnetic field produces the currents that
              create the magnetic field itself. The energy source for the fluid motions in
              the Earth's core is commonly supposed to be the thermal and compositional
              buoyancy of material released at the surface of the solid inner core as the
              Earth cools, and successful geodynamo simulations have been based on this idea.
              There is also a second possible energy source, the luni-solar precession of the
              Earth's axis of rotation. This has never been evaluated as a possible source of
              the Earth's magnetism. It is the object of this investigation to determine
              whether precession can maintain a geodynamo that creates an Earth-like field.
              If it fails to do so, the aim will be to find how precessional forces alter the
              fields produced by the successful buoyancy-driven geodynamo.
