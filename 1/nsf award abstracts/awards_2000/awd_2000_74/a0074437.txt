Abstract    :
              The purpose of this research is to make use of maps of the paths of lightning
              flashes to study the electrical activity of storms in several different regions
              of the world.  Such data have only recently become available.  French
              scientists have developed an interferometry-based system called Safir that
              provides a two-dimensional map of lightning paths (that is, the paths projected
              onto a horizontal plane).  More recently, researchers at New Mexico Tech have
              developed a system based on accurate time of arrival of the VHF signals from
              lightning to produce a three-dimensional map of the flashes. The New Mexico
              system, called the lightning mapping array (LMA), has been used in several
              parts of the United States; the Safir system in Europe, Japan, and Singapore. 
              In collaboration with French and American colleagues, Dr. Stolzenburg will use
              sequences of maps from different locations to investigate characteristics of
              the lightning such as (1) relative number of intracloud and cloud-to-ground
              flashes; (2) evolution of the horizontal extent and total area covered by
              flashes; (3) development of lightning activity compared with the development of
              radar echoes of storms.  The research is directed toward finding whether
              lightning data are useful as indicators of a storm's onset, severity, path, and
              decay, and to determining how the characteristics of lightning vary from one
              location to another.
