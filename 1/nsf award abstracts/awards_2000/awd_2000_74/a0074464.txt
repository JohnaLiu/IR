Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              Molecular Biophysics and is entitled "Systematic Evaluation of
              Algorithms/Models for Protein Structure Prediction Using a Database of Cyclic
              Oligopeptide NMR Data".  While many computational algorithms and models exist
              for simulation of protein folding, there is a distinct need for statistical
              measures of their accuracy and efficiency.  This project assembles a database
              of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data of cyclic oligopeptides.  These are
              proteins which are small enough to be computationally tractable but retain key
              features of protein structure and thus allow analysis of intermolecular and
              intramolecular forces as well as sampling algorithms for identifying stable
              conformations.  Algorithms whose accuracy have been validated through this
              research are then employed to predict the structure of previously
              uncharacterized cyclic peptides.
