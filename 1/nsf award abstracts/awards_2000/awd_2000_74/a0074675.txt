Abstract    :
              This project strives for greater understanding of the primary microscopic
              processes involved in the growth of III-nitrides. The approach incorporated
              high temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, reflection high energy electron
              diffraction and desorption mass spectroscopy. A predictive growth model will be
              sought. Rate equation models and kinetic Monte Carlo models (in collaboration
              with others) will be developed. Important issues to be addressed will be the
              differences in polarity and structure of the GaN surfaces that can be used, the
              role of growth parameters, and the role of defects. Methods to exert
              microscopic control over the growth of III-nitrides will be investigated.

The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials
              science with high technological relevance. Experimental tools are now available
              to allow atomic level observation of elementary surface processes which when
              better understood allow advances in fundamental science and technology. The
              results of this work may allow a new level of reliable control of materials
              growth, allowing semiconductor devices with reproducible properties to be
              attained in a variety of academic and commercial settings. An important feature
              of the program is the integration of research and education through the
              training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.
