Abstract    :
              This POWRE award by the Chemistry Division supports the research of Dr. Tracy D.
              McCarley on the characterization of branched and conducting polymers by the use
              of mass spectrometry.  The objective is to gain a better understanding of the
              applicability of new sample ionization methodologies in obtaining mass spectral
              data not available by other means. This project will establish new research
              approaches in the field of mass spectrometry of macromolecular systems.
