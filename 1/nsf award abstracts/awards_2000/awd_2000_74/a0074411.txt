Abstract    :
              
This project will develop numerically viable practical algorithms and
              associated theories for feedback design of control systems modeled by
              distributed parameter systems and systems of matrix second-order differential
              equations.  The specific problems to be considered are partial eigenvalue and
              eigenstructure assignments, robust eigenstructure assignment, model updating
              and optimal control.  Such feedback problems arise in a variety of industrial
              contexts, including design of automobiles, aircraft, high-rise buildings,
              large-space structures, and power and manufacturing systems.  Special attention
              will be given to solving the problems in their own natural formulations in
              distributed parameter systems.  Numerical methods that deal directly with such
              systems are rare, yet, it is desirable, from practical application
              point-of-view, that the problems be solved directly without discretization to
              second-order systems; only by doing so, is it possible to avoid losing vital
              inherent information.

The results of the project are expected to impact a
              variety of industries, from automotive to computer industries to aerospace and
              manufacturing applications; they will also be invaluable tools in the area of
              computer aided control systems design and control education.
