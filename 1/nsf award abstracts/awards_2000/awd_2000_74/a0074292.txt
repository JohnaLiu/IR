Abstract    :
              This project will allow the principal investigator, Elaine Terry, the
              opportunity to spend the 2000-01 academic year as a Visiting Professor at the
              University of Memphis in Tennessee.  The POWRE award will give her ample
              opportunity to enhance her research efforts.  The award is unique in that it
              will give the PI the opportunity to develop an undergraduate mathematics course
              in her field of research, Ramsey theory.  During the one year leave of absence,
              the PI will facilitate her professional advancement in three ways: (1) enable
              her to conduct research for publication, (2) establish research ties with
              prominent researchers, and (3) develop a seminar course in Ramsey theory for
              undergraduates.  It will allow the PI time to pursue her research objectives in
              an environment supportive of significant interactions with other researchers in
              Ramsey theory.  This opportunity for informal exchange of ideas with colleagues
              in the same field, and for exposure through seminars in other areas within the
              field will foster creative approaches to her research.   This POWRE project is
              supported by the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) and the MPS Office of 
              Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA).
