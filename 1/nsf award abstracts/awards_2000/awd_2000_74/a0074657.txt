Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is to better understand the chemistry of
              organolithium reagents.  Major efforts will be undertaken in the following
              areas: the mechanism of the metal-halogen exchange and related reactions, the
              structure of allenyl-propargyllithium reagents, the configurational stability
              of chiral organolithium reagents, the effect of polar cosolvents on
              organolithium structure and reactivity, the nature and consequences of
              chelation, and the role of electrophilic catalysts and ion pair structure in
              organolithium reactions.  The research is enhanced by the use of detailed
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) studies.

With this renewal award, the
              Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr.
              Hans J. Reich of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin,
              Madison.  Professor Reich will focus his work on gaining a mechanistic
              understanding of important reactions and processes in organolithium chemistry. 
              The experiments will be carried out under conditions in which they are used by
              synthetic chemists so that the results will have direct impact on a broad array
              of users.  The research also offers an excellent training opportunity for
              graduate students.
