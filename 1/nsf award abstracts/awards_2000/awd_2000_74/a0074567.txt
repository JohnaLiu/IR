Abstract    :
              Nitric oxide is a gas produced by the body to perform many functions, including
              ensuring the diffusion of oxygen from the lungs to the blood.  This project
              will develop and validate a technique to measure the amount of nitric oxide
              produced in the lungs, known to be a major site of synthesis.  Variation in the
              production of nitric oxide is thought to have consequences for people's ability
              to inhabit extreme environments where oxygen is limiting, such as those at high
              altitudes. Understanding how the millions of high-altitude natives of the
              Andean, Tibetan and Ethiopian Plateaus have adapted to ensure oxygen delivery
              under conditions of severe low oxygen will improve knowledge of the processes
              of human adaptation to extreme environments and to environmental change.  This
              POWRE project will provide Beall the opportunity for training and technique
              development that she cannot obtain otherwise.  This developmental and testing
              phase will be undertaken in a controlled, laboratory environment in order to
              establish the technique before undertaking field research in remote,
              high-altitude sites.
