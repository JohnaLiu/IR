The project involves measuring the Li isotopic composition of
              clays and oxyhydroxides to evaluate the significance of a proposed oceanic Mg+2
              sink in nearshore marine sediments.  The project has obvious links with studies
              using Li as a groundwater tracer and determining the Li isotope fractionation
              on clay minerals.  The PIs advisor has considerable expertise in Sr isotope
              applications to terrestrial chemical weathering as well as major element and
              clay mineral generation studies of soils.  These topics are key components in
              this project.  This project will not only answer an outstanding geochemical
              question, but will also fill a void in the PIs current geochemical
              background.
