This research project brings together a team of mathematicians
and
              physicists based at three campuses to work together on string
theory. 
              Specific research tasks include the study of the quantum
corrections to the
              mypermultiplet moduli spaces in theories with
eight supercharges, the
              structure of the moduli spaces of
heterotic string compactifications, M-theory
              models compactified
on seven-dimensional spaces whose global holonomy group
              lies in
the exceptional Lie group G2, M-theory models on
              Calabi-Yau
fourfolds, and a study of the AdS/CFT correspondence for branes
at
              singularities.

String theory is a promising candidate for a unifying theory
              of
the universe at its most fundamental levels.  Although the basic
idea is
              simple - elementary particles should be modeled as
mathematical loops of
              stgring rather than as points - working out
the details of this theory has
              involved and inspired some
sophisticated mathematical tools and ideas.  The
              task is by no
means complete, even in an area where the synergy
              between
mathematics and physics has been particularly productive, the
study
              of the Calabi-Yau spaces that appear as solutions of the
classical string
              equations of motion.  This is one of three
linked awards to a research group
              that includes mathematicians
and physicists at Duke University, Columbia
              University, and
Rutgers University, and NSF funds are supporting
              this
interdisciplinary group's collaborations through
videoconferencing and
              travel.
