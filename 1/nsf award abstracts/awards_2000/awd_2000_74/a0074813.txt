Abstract    :
              This research project addresses the fundamental mechanisms of non-adiabatic
              gas-surface interactions.  With the support of the Analytical and Surface
              Chemistry Program, Professor Andrew  Kummel and his coworkers at UC-San Diego
              are carrying out detailed experimental studies of the dissociative adsorption
              of halogen and interhalogen molecules interacting with low work function
              surfaces such as Al(111).  Velocity dependent molecular beams of dihalogens and
              interhalogens are used to probe the mechanisms of remote dissociative and
              abstractive chemisorption.  Velocity distributions of scattered halogen atoms,
              coupled with scanning probe microscopic examination of the reacted surface
              provide the details of energy partitioning and mechanism in these studies.  The
              interaction of oriented interhalogen molecules is also examined.  In addition
              to the fundamental insights obtained concerning non-adiabatic processes at
              surfaces, information relevant to the dry etching of electronic materials
              results from this work. 

The mechanisms of halogen etching reactions taking
              place on low work function surfaces is the focus of this research project
              carried out by Professor Kummel and coworkers at UCSD.  Using a combination of
              molecular beam methods, laser spectroscopic characterization of scattered
              species, and scanning probe microscopy to characterize the reacted surface,
              detailed information about halogen based plasma enhanced etching processes is
              obtained.  This fundamental research has broad impact on the development of
              electronic materials etching processes, as well as providing fundamental
              insight into the mechanisms of an important class of surface reactions.
