POWRE: Computational
              Methods to Support Molecular Biology Applications.

The purpose of this
              CISE/EIA POWRE proposal is to allow the PI to conduct research and work with
              investigators at the Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at
              St. Jude Children's Research Hospital to develop data mining algorithms and
              software for use with microarray data.  In addition, an introductory elective
              course on bioinformatics and computational biology for upper-division computer
              science majors at the University of Mississippi will be developed.
