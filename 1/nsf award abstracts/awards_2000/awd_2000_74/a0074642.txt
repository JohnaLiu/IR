Abstract    :
              This POWRE award will support the PI's proposed research while visiting the
              laboratory of Dr. Jonathan Arnold at the University of Georgia, a leading
              researcher in fungal genome. Dr. Arnold is the director of NSF funded Fungal
              Genome Resource which provides high-throughput physical mapping, sequencing,
              and of fungal genomes microarraying and Internet access to the Fungal Genome
              Database. This visit will afford the POWRE recipient great potential for
              interdisciplinary collaboration as the research progresses. It is anticipated
              that this research will ultimately result in publicly available databases and
              statistical data mining tools that will be of benefit to the larger scientific
              community. The research to be conducted while on this visit will include
              statistical clustering and classification used to group genes with similar
              expression profiles; exploration of the possibility of using dimensionality et
              al. reduction techniques such as Kruskal and Shepard's algorithm to analyze
              microarray data. Also model based (parametric) clustering will be
              investigated.
