Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the work of Dr. Vernon D. Parker at Utah State University in Logan,
              Utah.   The work will extend earlier studies looking into the details of the
              mechanism of hydrogen transfer reactions from radical cations, positively
              charged organic compounds with an unpaired electron spin.   Intermediates of
              this type are involved in a number of important biological oxidations by
              enzymes and industrial oxidation and polymerization reactions.

The kinetics
              of C-H bond cleavage in various radical cations - by either proton or hydride
              transfer - will be studied by electrochemical and spectrophotometric methods
              (including stopped-flow) to determine how kinetic isotope effects depend on
              structure and extent of reaction.   The hypothesis that many of these
              apparently simple bimolecular hydrogen transfer reactions actually take place
              by two steps with kinetically significant intermediates will be tested by
              experiments.   The work is expected to provide valuable experience to graduate
              and postdoctoral students, as well as providing fundamental information of use
              to the organic chemical community.
