This award provides funds to support the attendance of United
              States participants at the Second International Conference on Ultrasonic
              Biomedical Microscanning (UBM); the conference will be held at Windermere
              House, Lake Rosseau, Canada, September 5-8, 2000. The technical program builds
              on the results of the First International Conference on Ultrasonic Biomedical
              Microscanning, Eastwood Park, UK, September 1-4, 1998. The National Science
              Foundation (NSF) provided travel support to that meeting for six U. S.
              participants of the approximately 50 attendees from the U.S., Europe, and
              Asia.

Ultrasonic microscanning is a recent, rapidly emerging field with
              significant potential for medical visualization and fundamental biological and
              physical studies. UBM employs new ultrasonic transducers whose high center
              frequencies (above 20 MHz) and concomitant large bandwidths provide
              highly-detailed visualization of, e.g., 5-mm depths in superficial organs,
              tissues accessed via catheters, or unstained microscopic specimens.  As an
              example, 50-MHz transducers are being used to examine the human eye with a
              resolution finer than 0.04 mm; acoustic microscopes using frequencies higher
              than 500 MHz have produced resolution superior to optical microscopes --
              without the need for staining.  

The conference will serve as a stimulus to
              promoting productive research and development directions for this new field.
              The objectives of the conference are: to provide a forum to assess the current
              state-of-the-art in UBM technologies and applications; to foster communication
              among experts in diverse multi-disciplinary UBM fields; to identify key
              problems needing solution for practical deployment; and, to share insights into
              future directions with experts in UBM and allied non-ultrasound methodologies.
              An Executive Summary of the proceedings of the conference will be submitted to
              NSF.
