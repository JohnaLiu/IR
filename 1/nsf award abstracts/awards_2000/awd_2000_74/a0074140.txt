Recent observations from the Infrared Space Observatory
              have provided the first
measurements of the mixing ratio of the methyl
              radical, CH 3 , in the atmospheres of Saturn and Neptune. CH 3 is produced by
              photolysis of CH 4 and is the key photochemical intermediate leading to complex
              organic molecules on the giant planets and moons. However, the observed CH 3
              infrared emissions are much weaker than predicted by current photochemical
              models. Several modelers favor using a rate coefficient for  CH 3 + CH 3 +M-->
              C 2 H 6 + M  for the temperature range 140-190 K that is at least 10 times
              larger than the value at 296 K, the lowest temperature at which laboratory
              measurements are available. Reliable experimental and theoretical
              pressure-dependent rate constants are required for this reaction and for others
              at low temperatures and pressures to model hydrocarbon, methyl, nitrile, and CO
              concentrations and to derive atmospheric transport rates.  

Dr. Smith and
              his colleagues  will combine a theoretical approach with selected
low
              temperature-low pressure recombination rate measurements in the laboratory to
              solve this modeling problem. The theoretical computations will provide
              consistent rate parameters to describe the data and potential energy surfaces
              and will cover a wider temperature range (30-3000K) than the current
              expressions, which were designed for combustion modeling purposes and
              extrapolate unreliably to low temperatures. Experiments will be conducted at
              200K and lower, using a laser photolysis, resonance-enhanced multiphoton
              ionization (REMPI) technique in a low-pressure cell to provide key missing
              low-temperature data.  A three-year program of research will be conducted to
              improve low-temperature hydrocarbon kinetics parameters in models of planetary
              atmospheres, emphasizing (1) examination of mechanisms in existing
              photochemical models with sensitivity analysis to identify important
              uncertainties, (2) theoretical parameterization of the temperature-dependent
              rates of CH 3 + CH 3 + M --> C 2 H 6 + M and other key steps, and (3) low
              temperature and pressure measurements of these reaction rates for input to the
              parameterizations. Reliable values for these rates must be made available to
              accurately model outer planet atmospheric photochemistry and to properly
              interpret old and new planetary data, including the derivation of transport
              rates.  This award is funded through the Planetary Astronomy Program.
