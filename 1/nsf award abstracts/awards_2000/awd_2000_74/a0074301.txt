Abstract

The objective of this
              project is the finite element superconvergence.  The research efforts will be
              devoted (1) to develop general theory of finite element superconvergence and
              its recovery with emphases on triangular elements, irregular grids, and
              harmonic functions; (2) to develop superconvergent theory for those successful
              numerical methods in handling boundary layers and locking.  Some recent
              mathematical theory in finite element superconvergence, asymptotic regularity,
              as well as improved interior analysis will be employed in the roject.

The
              superconvergence study is of great importance for adaptive design of
              computational algorithms.  Therefore, the proposed research has a direct
              application in high-performance computing, computational mechanics,
              computational fluid dynamics, financial mathematics, mathematical biology,
              manufacturing, and other scientific fields.  The research  will widen the
              knowledge in scientific community on both mathematical theory and practical
              algorithm design.
