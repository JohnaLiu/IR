Abstract    :
              The PI will use her POWRE award to spend a year at Rutgers University to
              collaborate with Prof. Wolmer V. Vasconcelos.
 
The PI will introduce
              computational methods in research projects on one--dimensional local rings and
              Rees algebras of modules. She will also develop research projects suitable for
              exploration by undergraduate students.  This POWRE project is jointly supported
              by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of
              Mathematical Sciences (DMS).
