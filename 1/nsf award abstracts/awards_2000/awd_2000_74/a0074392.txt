Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology
              for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of Ecological and
              Evolutionary Physiology and is entitled "Diversity and Physiology of Extemely
              Small Algae."  This research addresses the question of what role differences in
              niche adaptation play in the existence of different clades of marine
              cyanobacteria.  Two free-living strains of the marine cyanobacterium
              Synechococcus, one representing a coastal clade and the other an open ocean
              clade, are being compared to assess physiological differences and adaptive
              capacities to nitrogen starvation.  Subtraction cDNA libraries are being
              produced and the sequences analyzed to identify protein sequence and motifs of
              nitrate transporting proteins.  Generated sequence is used to produce a
              microarray, and chip experiments are designed to examine and compare the
              magnitude and kinetics of the two strains to nitrogen deprivation.  This data
              will help answer the question of whether different strains differ in
              expressional patterns in ways that indicate niche adaptation or resource
              partitioning, both of which are frequent evolutionary responses to
              competition.
