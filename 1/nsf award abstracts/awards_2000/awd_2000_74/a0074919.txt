POWRE:  Adaptive
              Fuzzy Intrusion Detection using Cooperative Agents


This POWRE proposal
              explores an interdisciplinary area of research in network security.  The
              project proposes a novel method that uses distributed fuzzy agents to recognize
              intrusions in networked systems. Intrusions can be detected by noting anomalies
              in the use of a system and misuse of computing resources or data. As part of
              this research, the following issues will be addressed: (1) the development of
              distributed fuzzy agents to collect and assess data on a switched network, (2)
              new methods of encoding complex causal sequences and intrusions, and (3) novel
              mechanisms for finding new attack profiles and methods to stop false alarms
              using neural fuzzy learning methods.
