An award under the POWRE program will enable the PI to gain
              expertise in bioengineering, biomaterials and implant mechanics to add to her
              experience in mechanics and materials in general.  
This research will begin
              an investigation of microporous titanium (Ti foam) for use as a bone implant
              material. There are several motivations for this work: First, the stiffness
              mismatch between current metallic implant materials and the surrounding bone
              can cause stress-shielding, leading to bone resorption and eventual implant
              failure. The development of completely porous metallic implants where the
              material is designed to more closely mimic natural bone properties will help
              reduce stress shielding problems experienced in current implants. Second, bone
              cement failure and cement debris also have a detrimental impact on implants,
              which is avoidable by use of a porous/cementless implant material. Third,
              development of a fully porous material with controllable microstructure will
              enable design of implants with improved functionality for tissue attachment as
              well as unique incorporation of other synthetic materials (e.g., polymer or
              ceramic coatings or surfaces).  In addition to porosity level, pore shape and
              orientation will clearly affect the mechanical properties and extent of cell
              ingrowth. Thus, investigation of porous microstructures to identify those which
              will accelerate and enhance bone ingrowth, while retaining mechanical strength,
              would provide critical new information for design of bone implants, both to
              reduce failure rates and to improve quality of life for patients by rapid
              implant integration.  
The proposed work will specifically involve
              
**Mechanical testing and finite element analysis to ascertain stiffness and
              strength properties of the Ti foam samples; and
**Cell growth studies
              performed on Ti foam samples seeded with bone cells and examined at intervals
              for ingrowth.
