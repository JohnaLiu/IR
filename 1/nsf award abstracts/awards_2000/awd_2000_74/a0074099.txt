Exactly how plutonism,
              especially high volume plutons in continental magmatic arcs, fits in with
              active continental margin tectonics is controversial.  Needed parameters
              include understanding magma chamber processes, how fabrics relate to the magma
              chamber and rates of processes during emplacement.  This project will utilize
              excellent exposures in the Tuolumne Intrusive Complex to address several of
              these issues by a comprehensive integrated study of several transects across
              the complex.  Results are expected to place greater constraints on the coupling
              of magmatic and host rock processes during chamber growth, on processes (mixing
              mingling, collapse) occurring along internal margins during emplacement of
              subsequent magma pulses, the connections to a volcanic feeder system and the
              relationship between magmatic fabrics and all the operative processes.
