Abstract    :
              This POWRE award provides funding to complete a geochemical study of basaltic
              rocks recovered from the Central Basin Fault of the West Philippine Basin.
              Samples were previously collected by the PI through participation in a JAMSTEC
              research cruise and will be analyzed for trace element abundance and Sr, Nd and
              Pb isotopes. The objective of the work is to investigate the geochemical
              influence of subduction on the chemical composition of magma erupted at a
              spreading ridge. The PI will collaborate on this project with Japanese
              scientists. This international collaboration will allow the PI to take a
              leadership role in international geochemical research and will lead to expanded
              research opportunities for her and her students.
