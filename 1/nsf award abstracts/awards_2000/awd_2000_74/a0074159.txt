The evolution of reproductive isolation is critically
              important in the speciation process, because it is cessation of gene flow that
              definitively places diverging lineages onto separate evolutionary paths 
              towards becoming new species.  How speciation and reproductive isolation occur
              depends on the number of genes conferring isolation and the relative importance
              of pre- vs. post-zygotic reproductive barriers. Identifying the number and
              magnitude of genes involved can also elucidate both the time and strength of
              natural selection needed for speciation.

We will study the genetic basis of
              reproductive isolation in the Louisiana Irises, a species complex has been a
              focus of ecological, genetic and evolutionary studies for almost a century. We
              will construct a QTL (quantitative trait loci) map of reproductive isolating
              mechanisms separating two species, Iris fulva and I. brevicaulis.  Our analysis
              will locate QTLs that have the largest effect on the expression of both
              pre-mating and post-mating barriers to reproduction. The traits associated with
              the pre-mating barriers include floral differences that cause bumblebees to
              preferentially visit I. brevicaulis and hummingbirds to preferentially visit I.
              fulva (e.g., flowering time, flower color, nectar guide shape, nectar sugar
              concentration). The traits associated with post-mating barriers include (i)
              gamete competition (i.e., conspecific pollen tubes grow more quickly and thus
              fertilize ovules more efficiently than do pollen tubes from the alternate
              species) and (ii) pollen fertility of hybrids formed between the two species.
