Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              Ecological and Evolutionary Physiology and is entitled "The evolution of
              species recognition and mate choice: a neural network approach".  The aim of
              this research is to model mate choice behavior via use of artificial neural
              networks that will model cognitive function.  The proposed research
              investigates a well known problem in evolutionary biology: the evolution of
              species recognition that both accompanies and influences speciation itself,
              i.e. the manner in which the signal recipient (usually female) evolves, and how
              this change affects evolution of the signaler (typically male).  The model
              neural networks are being tested against the behavior of spadefoot frogs and
              will determine if species recognition by the female will result in stabilizing
              the male phenotype or, rather, drive it in a specific direction.
