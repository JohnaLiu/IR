Abstract    :
              This POWRE award by the Chemistry Division will allow Dr. Leslie Jimenez to
              pursue research in synthetic organic chemistry at Rutgers University/New
              Brunswick aimed at developing intermediates in the synthesis of the clinically
              important antitumor agent mitomycin C and analogous compounds. Dr. Jimenez will
              involve both graduate and undergraduate co-workers in this study and these
              students will be exposed to new areas of synthetic organic chemistry in
              addition to being trained in a variety of standard synthetic techniques and
              methods of characterization of organic materials.
