Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Microbial Biology
              for FY 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of population
              biology and is entitled "Evolution of Life History Characters in a Arbovirus." 
               Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) has been chosen for this study not only
              because it is similar to important human pathogens, e.g., measles, influenza,
              poliovirus, HIV, hepatitis A, B and C, but its genomic information is stored in
              RNA instead of DNA.  RNA replication is error-prone, and therefore many
              mutations are constantly produced that allow extremely rapid evolution and
              offer an opportunity to study specific aspects of virus evolution and general
              issues of population genetics.  A combination of comparative, mathematical,
              experimental, and molecular studies are being used to ask how the life
              histories of parasites adapt to different hosts and how these life history
              traits and trade-offs between the traits change in response to natural
              selection in the laboratory.   The answers will significantly enhance our
              understanding of the patterns and diversity of life cycles in parasites.
