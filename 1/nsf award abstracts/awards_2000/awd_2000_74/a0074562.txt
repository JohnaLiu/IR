Abstract    :
              Three studies will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess
              the neuroanatomical circuitry involved in three social cognitive domains. In
              one study, the neuroanatomical of schematic social information will be
              examined. In a second study, the neuroanatomical differences associated with
              high-level abstract understanding versus low-level concrete understanding of
              events derived from action identification theory will be investigated. The
              third study will focus on the neuroanatomical correlates of outcome framing in
              terms of gains versus losses. This is a small grant for exploratory research
              aimed at establishing the utility of a cognitive neuroscience analysis of
              social cognitive phenomena.
