POWRE Proposal #0074779 Abstract: Genetic Mosaicism in Armillaria
              gallica

Armillaria gallica is an ecologically variable basidiomycete fungus
              that
functions as a saprophyte and pathogen of stressed trees in many of
              the
world's boreal and temperate forests.  The PI recently reported
              that
basidiomes (mushrooms) of this fungus can be a genetic mosaic
              (Fungal
Genetics and Biology, 2000, vol. 29).  This was demonstrated by
              isolating
ten cells from a single basidiome and genotyping each for six
              different
nuclear loci.  Nine different genotypes were recovered for the ten
              cells
that were assayed, indicating that this basidiome was a genetic
              mosaic.
Fifteen cells isolated from another basidiome of the same species
              produced
only one genotype when analyzed for the same six loci, indicating
              that this
basidiome was not a genetic mosaic, at least for these six
              loci.

The goal of this NSF POWRE-supported study is to better understand
              the
phenomenon of genetic mosaicism in A. gallica's life cycle and
              the
contribution mosaicism makes to this species' ability to
              function
successfully in forest soils.  To accomplish this, the PI will
              investigate
(1) How common and geographically widespread genetic mosaicism is,
              (2) How
the mosaic condition develops, and (3) How mosaicism affects the
              ability of
A. gallica to infect plant hosts and to grow under ecologically
              variable
conditions.
