This is a project to investigate diffusional mass
              transport in MgSiO3 perovskite and MgO periclase under high pressure (>23 Gpa).
               The study is aimed at placing rigorous experimental constraints on the plastic
              rheologies of these important high-pressure phases under temperature and
              pressure conditions of the lower mantle.  Perovskite and periclase are
              generally agreed to be the most abundant minerals in the lower mantle, and
              their plastic flow properties are thus expected to control the viscosity of the
              mantle below 670 km.  It will be possible using the results of this
              experimental investigation to directly estimate the viscosity of a
              perovskite-periclase lower mantle deforming by diffusion creep, as well as the
              dependence of the viscosity on temperature, pressure, and grain size.  The
              study will thus provide a much-needed constraint on geophysical models of
              viscosity stratification in the mantle, and in doing so is expected to
              significantly improve our understanding of the dynamics of the Earth's deep
              interior.
