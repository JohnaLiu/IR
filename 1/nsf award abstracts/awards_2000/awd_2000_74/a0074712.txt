Abstract    :
              This project seeks to implement a state-of-the-art photoluminescence capability
              to extend the PIs   semiconductor characterization capabilities and to provide
              an important tool in undergraduate education; it will be used in undergraduate
              laboratory projects for a special materials science course. The PI has
              established a research program in exploring materials issues of semiconductor
              thin film growth focused on microstructural, morphological, and compositional
              evolution in III-V semiconductor alloys. This project will allow correlation of
              microstructural, morphological, and compositional phenomena to optoelectronic
              properties.

This is a research enhancement grant made under the
              Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program.
              The POWRE grant will maintain and raise her visi-bility in the very competitive
              and male-dominated field of semiconductor and microelectronic re-search by
              branching her research into the realm of optical characterization and device
              applica-tions. The research is expected to contribute basic materials science
              knowledge at a fundamental level of special relevance to the behavior of
              electronic/photonic materials, and to assist with the integration of research
              and education. The project is co-supported by the Division of Materials
              Research, and the MPS OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities).
