Abstract    :
                   Plants first inhabited land approximately 450 million years ago.  The
              adaptations in plant form that  accompanied the movement of plants to land have
              been well studied.  Much less is known about the physiological changes or
              adaptations that accompanied this important event.  This project will focus on
              the origin of the small heat shock protein family in plants, and the question
              of whether diversification in these small heat shock proteins was associated
              with movement onto land.
     All organisms have a heat shock response.  Heat
              shock proteins are produced when organisms are exposed to high temperatures
              and, through interactions with other proteins, the heat shock proteins enable
              organisms to withstand and survive high-temperature stress. In land plants the
              small heat shock proteins are a particularly important component of the heat
              shock response, making up the bulk of the protein produced during heat shock. 
              Compared to the small heat shock proteins of other organisms, the plant small
              heat shock proteins are also unusually diverse.  Using cDNA cloning and PCR
              techniques the PI will examine the small heat shock protein genes of
              Charophytes (a group of algae) and Bryophytes (hornworts, liverworts, and
              mosses; the most ancient lineages of land plants).  The PI will determine if
              the small heat shock proteins increased in number and changed in amino acid
              sequence during the time period that plants first
inhabited land.
     This
              POWRE award will enable Dr. Waters to continue her independent research career
              and to attend to family needs by supporting her as a visiting scientist at the
              University of California, San Diego.
