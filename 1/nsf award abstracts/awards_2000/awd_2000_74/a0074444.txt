This project will investigate wolf-ungulate interactions in
              Yellowstone National Park.  The research capitalizes on a rare ecological
              experiment resulting from the reintroduction of wolves into the park after a
              60-year absence and builds upon a long-term database compiled by the
              scientists.  Most elk mortality prior to wolf reintroduction has been
              attributed to starvation (i.e. resource limitation).  It is predicted that wolf
              predation will substantially increase elk mortality, and that the consequences
              of this predation will be an appreciable decease in population size toward an
              alternative equilibrium.  The unfolding experiment provides an opportunity to
              test the influence of "bottom-up" versus "top-down" ecological processes in
              regulating populations.  Aerial monitoring and intensive ground-based
              backtracking will be employed to estimate prey selection, predation rates, and
              total number of animals killed.  Data from this investigation will provide the
              basis for a new predator-prey model that is both stochastic and age-structured.
               Results of this project, as well as complementary international
              collaborations, will significantly enhance wildlife science in large mammalian
              systems and facilitate design of sound endangered species programs.
