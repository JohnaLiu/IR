The goal of this POWRE grant is to give the Principal
              Investigator  (P.I.) an opportunity to experience an academic career in
              teaching and research.   This award will fund a teaching and research
              sabbatical at Pomona College. As a leading liberal arts college with strong
              science departments, Pomona College is the ideal location for teaching courses
              that speak to a wide audience of students.

The specific goals are to: 1.
              Teach several courses.  The courses will include one in introductory astronomy
              that incorporates activities developed in the P.I.'s teacher training workshop,
              and an undergraduate seminar in which the tentative subject is a sharp scrutiny
              of various areas of pseudoscience. 2. Provide advice to Pomona College in the
              establishment of a new major in Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences. 3. Work
              with students at Pomona College on research projects (the tentative topics are
              observations of seasonal volatile transport on Pluto and physical
              characterization of Near Earth Objects). The relationships built with students
              will be reinforced by collaborating with faculty at the Claremont Colleges in
              establishing a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program. 4.
              Integrate student teachers from the Claremont Colleges into the "Teachers Touch
              the Sky" program. The experience in the academic environment gained through
              this POWRE award will enable the P.I. to make a career change. 

This project
              is funded by the Division of Astronomical Sciences.
