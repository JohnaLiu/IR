Abstract    :
              This POWRE award by the Chemistry Division extends a sabbatical leave for Dr.
              Rosemary Marusak from Kenyon College to work with Brian Hasinoff at the
              University of Manitoba. This leave will permit Dr. Marusak to extend her
              research on the inorganic chemistry of metal complexes of cardioprotective
              drugs and their in vitro oxidation of biomolecules to in vivo studies of such
              systems for which Dr. Hasinoff is a leading expert. It will also allow her to
              gain experience in cell culture techniques and electron paramagnetic resonance
              applications in bioinorganic chemistry. Dr. Marusak will use this knowledge to
              strengthen her research collaboration with her faculty colleagues in the
              Biology Department, sustain her collaboration with Dr. Hasinoff and enhance her
              teaching of bioinorganic chemistry.
