Abstract    :
              This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological
              Informatics for 2000.

The research and training plan is in the area of
              Evolution of Developmental Mechanisms and is entitled "Evolvability and
              Modularity of Molecules, Viruses, and Regulatory Networks".  Plastogenetic
              congruence, a correlation between environment-induced and mutation-induced
              phenotypes, has been shown by computational studies of RNA secondary structure
              evolution.  This correlation, where phenotypes produced by an RNA sequence
              under thermodynamic fluctuation mirror those produced by genetic mutation, has
              profound evolutionary implications as RNA sequences undergo environmental
              canalization towards more thermodynamically stable structures.  Assuming that
              the rule of plastogenetic congruence is followed, phenotypes that are resistant
              to environmental changes must also resistant to mutation-induced changes and
              the ensuing novel phenotypes.  Essentially, phenotypes will reach evolutionary
              dead-ends.  This research applies these principles to develop theoretical
              frameworks in which to study indirect impacts of a heterogeneous immunological
              environment on viral evolutionary potential and the origin of modular
              organization in viruses via analysis of RNA sequence data as well as artificial
              RNA evolutionary experimentation.
