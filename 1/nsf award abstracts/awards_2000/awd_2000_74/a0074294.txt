Abstract    :
              This proposal has two parts.  Mather's part concerns using variational methods
              to prove the existence of "wandering" orbits in Hamiltonian systems.  The sort
              of thing he hopes to prove are illustrated by the conjectures which go under
              the name "Arnold diffusion".  Forni's part concerns area preserving flows on
              surfaces.  He intends to study two conjectures: an extension of the KAM
              theorem, where Kronecker flows are replaced by area preserving flows on
              surfaces of higher genus; and a conjecture that would imply that the
              convergence in Birkhoff's ergodic theorem takes place with polynomial-like
              decay.

	Both parts of this proposal concern generalized KAM theory, which
              has important applications to questions of stability and randomness in
              conservative physical systems.  For example, the long-term dynamics of the
              solar system is far from being understood, and this proposal could contribute
              to mathematician's  understanding.
