A POWRE award will support a study of the effects of lithium
              additives to control expansion by alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in concrete.
              This reaction occurs between reactive silicates present in some aggregate and
              pore solution alkalis and produces an alkali-silica gel that is capable of
              expansion, damaging the affected concrete structure. A more thorough
              understanding of the mechanisms of expansion control will provide the basis for
              determining which additives in which dosages should be used in new and existing
              concrete structures to avoid damage by the reaction. This proposed research is
              critical for this investigator at this early stage in her career as it will
              allow her to launch a new research area while building upon her existing
              knowledge and skills.

A key component of the proposed research is the
              development of the novel application of laser scanning confocal microscopy
              (LSCM) to examine cement-based materials. Examination of cement-based materials
              by confocal microscopy has been relatively unexplored, but this technique
              offers much promise because of the flexible sample preparation requirements,
              high resolution, and ability to generate three-dimensional representations.
              Because of their visual impact, these three-dimensional models can be used
              advantageously in both technical education and public outreach, and several
              activities have been proposed including the development of two brief tutorials
              (one appropriate for university education; one appropriate for K-12 education).
              By demonstrating the utility of this microscopy technique for through-depth
              examination of concrete to study the alkali-silica reaction, LSCM will find
              wider applications in concrete technology.  Development and refinement of
              sample preparation protocols, observation methods, and representation formats
              would establish the investigator as a leader in innovative microscopy of
              cement-based materials and could lead to additional funding opportunities for
              the PI.
