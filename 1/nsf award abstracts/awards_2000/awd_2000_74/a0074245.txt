              Abstract

The proposal is motivated by the current need to better understand
              those industrial processes dominated by the flow of gas-solid mixtures .The
              attendant property measurement of these unsteady, three-dimensional flows
              precludes their sampling, since solid probes would disturb the phenomena of
              interest (the formation or destruction of clusters, for instance). There has
              been some success, however, in using remote sensing tomography: in such a
              technique, the cumulative interference of many beams with the matter inside a
              flow container, can be reconstructed mathematically into a three-dimensional
              time-resolved map of local properties. The PI proposes the "electrical
              impedance tomography", in which a number of electrodes are mounted around the
              volume of interest, and a prescribed current is applied to them. It is then
              possible to infer from the exiting voltages the spatial distribution of
              impedance inside the volume. The phase distribution map (liquid-gas, solid-gas)
              can be extracted from this data by classical electromagnetic theory.
  
              Specifically, the PI proposes to develop and test a solid-gas tomographic
              technique, where both space and time resolution will be achieved. The field
              covered by 48 electrodes will be strongly three dimensional (1128 independent
              projections), and the resolution will be boosted by using multiple frequency
              excitation, where 12 lock-in amplifiers will collect an order of magnitude more
              data in the same time interval. The goal is "to collect a complete data set
              within 10 milliseconds". In this fashion, the PI is confident that he will be
              able to " examine cluster formation and bulk flow dynamics, and near wall
              particle dynamics".
