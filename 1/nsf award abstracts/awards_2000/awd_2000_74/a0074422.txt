This award provides funding that will enable the PI to
              learn modern methods of computational analyses and modeling that will
              significantly broaden the scope of her research. Currently, she is
              investigating the effects of changing Ultra Violet Radiation (UVR) on marine
              primary productivity. However she would like to expand this research into
              predictive/theoretical  modeling of the consequences of UVR changes on
              phytoplankton photoecology and related ecosystem dynamics. Ultimately, she
              would like to develop a primary production model that considers the influence
              of UVR at the ecosystem level and that is mechanistically based upon the
              complex regulatory biology that controls the UVR photoecology of marine plants.
              This award is relevant to the POWRE program because the PI, who has just spent
              four years in an administrative position, will be able to expand her science
              career and continue to advance the visibility of women in science.
