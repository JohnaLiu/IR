This project will apply mathematical modeling and
              computational 
simulation to epitaxial growth of thin films, in particular
              semiconductor 
materials grown by MBE (molecular beam epitaxy).  The research
              topics 
are characterized by complex geometry and a hierarchy of length
              scales, 
requiring significantly new mathematical and numerical approaches.
              
Specific topics include strain in thin films, accelerated numerical methods,
              
coarse-graining and the dynamics of interacting defect lines.

This project
              will apply mathematical modeling and computational 
simulation to material
              science, in particular to semiconductor materials 
grown by MBE (molecular
              beam epitaxy). Although MBE is just one of 
many possible growth techniques,
              it is the growth method for many of the 
most demanding applications, such as
              high-performance, low-power 
systems for wireless communications. Modeling and
              simulation are not 
generally well developed for MBE growth, and current
              computational 
methods are not sufficient to address many of the important
              problems of 
epitaxy. The goal is to develop new mathematical models and
              
computational methods that will significantly advance the state of the art.
              
This project is multi-disciplinary, involving mathematics (both applied 
and
              core) and materials science, as well as participation from both industry 
and
              university.  The distinguishing feature of this collaboration is that it
              
combines expertise in modeling, simulation and experimentation in one
              
cohesive group.
