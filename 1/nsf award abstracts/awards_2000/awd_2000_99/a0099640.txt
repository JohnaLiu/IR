Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to investigate aspects of low dimensional dynamical
systems.
              The most important long term project is to better
understand a topological
              description of C^r generic area preserving
diffeomorphisms of surfaces where r
              > 1.  In addition the proposer
hopes to investigate the action of more general
              groups than the integers 
or the reals on surfaces, and in particular area
              preserving actions.

Professor Franks will continue his investigation of
              the
dynamics of surface maps.  The study of such transformations,
especially
              area preserving ones, has a long history going back to
Poincare and G. D.
              Birkhoff.  There are numerous applications of
results in this area to
              classical mechanics as well as more modern
chaotic dynamics.  The proposed
              research will address questions
concerning the existence of periodic behavior
              in area preserving
two-dimensional discrete dynamical systems and a
              topological
description of the dynamics of such systems.
