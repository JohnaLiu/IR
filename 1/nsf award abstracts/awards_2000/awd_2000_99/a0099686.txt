Abstract    :
              The award covers graduate student and undergraduate student research
with the
              PP2PP experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at
the Brookhaven
              National Laboratory. The goal of the international
PP2PP collaboration is the
              comprehensive measurement of
proton-proton elastic scattering, eventually
              covering a wide, and
unexplored, domain in energy (from 50 to 500 GeV) and
              momentum
transfer (from 0.006 GeV^2 to 1.3 GeV^2) within a single
              experiment.
The first data run with polarized proton beams will take place
              in
the Fall 2001. Two Roman pot detector stations will be used, one in
each
              arm. Two more stations plus central tracking will be added in
following years.
              With the experiment and by comparing with existing
antiproton-proton elastic
              scattering data, the helicity structure of
the long-distance pp interaction
              will be investigated, the exchange
mechanisms will be studied and connected to
              QCD calculations of
multi-gluon exchanges. The intriguing dip structure in pp
              elastic
scattering will be accessible with high statistics. At very
              small
momentum transfers PP2PP will measure absolute cross sections and
the
              details of the forward scattering amplitude. Beyond 2003, a
special tune of
              the RHIC machine will allow the lowest accessible
momentum transfer to reach
              into the Coulomb regime. The small scale
of the PP2PP experiment makes it
              ideally suited for participation by
undergraduate students in all aspects of
              construction, data taking,
and data analysis.
