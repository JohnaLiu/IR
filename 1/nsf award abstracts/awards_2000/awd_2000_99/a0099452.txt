This proposal has projects in two areas of nuclear theory. 
              The first project will use the recoil-corrected continuum shell model (RSCCM)
              to investigate nucleon induced reactions on light nuclei, in particular those
              nucleon capture reactions of astrophysical interest.   The recent extension of
              this model to p-shell nuclei allows the study of single neutron halo nuclei,
              polarized electron scattering data, and a variety of other topics including the
              effective interaction of nuclear structure theory.  The second area of research
              is in the study of the hyperon-nucleon interaction with meager experimental
              input from scattering and binding energy systematics of light hypernuclei.  The
              RCCSM, by allowing the hyperon to be bound or unbound, is particularly suitable
              for hypernuclear structure calculations because bound state excitation and
              quasi-free scattering are included in one consistent framework.  The
              theoretical understanding expected from this work would be useful for
              experiments both at Brookhaven and Jefferson Lab.
