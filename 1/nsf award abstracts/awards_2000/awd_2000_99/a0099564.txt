Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this project is to investigate, theoretically and
              experimentally,
nonlinear propagation of ultrashort light pulses under
              conditions in which soliton formation occurs. Multi-dimensional solitons will
              be studied in materials with quadratic nonlinearities and in nonlinear media
              with periodic structures. These materials and structures will be chosen and
              developed to create environments that support solitons. A specific overall goal
              is to generate stable three-dimensional spatio-temporal solitons - so-called
              light bullets. The proposed work should have important implications for
              all-optical information processing as well as for scientific applications that
              involve the interaction of intense light fields with matter.
