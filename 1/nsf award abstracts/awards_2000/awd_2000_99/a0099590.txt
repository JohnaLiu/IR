Abstract    :
              
Research in theoretical physics will be carried out, focussing
              on
foundational aspects of string theory.  String theory is the
most
              promising candidate for a consistent description of quantum
mechanics and
              gravity, and has advanced rapidly in recent years. 
Research will particularly
              center around understanding the decay
of unstable systems in string theory, as
              well as obtaining a better
theory of black holes.   Both questions involve
              fundamental aspects
of string theory and so are important to the development
              of the subject.
