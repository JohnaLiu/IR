The gulf of Corinth is an active continental rift with high
              seismicity and extensional strain. The bunding faults are high angle where they
              are exposed at the margins of the Gulf, but become much more shallow dipping at
              depth. The mechanisms of faulting and extension are poorly understood, but are
              similar to that observed in other rifted margins. The primary deformation is
              focused beneath the Gulf making the use of marine seismic reflection profiling
              the best technique to directly image these features.

The present project
              will use the RV Ewing to acquire 1o days of multi-channel seismic reflection
              data from the Gulf of Corinth rift. Primary analyses will be focused on
              determining the mode of deformation and how it varies along strike. The project
              will be an important step in determining  how exposed deformation relates to
              evidence of deformation at depth, and hence the dynamics of the faults in this
              area. The project will be undertaken in cooperation with Greek and French
              scietists.
