Conference support: Understanding Ecosystems: The Role
              of Quantitative Models in Observation, Synthesis, and Prediction

This
              conference will focus on the role of quantitative models in understanding
              ecosystems. The conference themes will emphasize the role of models in
              ecosystem science research, education and decision making; testing and
              validating models; mechanisms, resolution and uncertainty in models; and
              predicting ecosystem dynamics. The topics were chosen to oblige authors to
              synthesize the literature, rather than present details of one or a few specific
              models. Recent years have seen dramatic advancements in the computational power
              and mathematical tools available to modelers. The body of traditional,
              mechanistic, empirical research is also growing phenomenally. The field is ripe
              for major gains in the synthetic and predictive power of models, and this comes
              at a time of growing need by society for quantitative models that can inform
              debate about critical environmental issues. Quantitative models provide a means
              to test understanding of ecosystems by allowing the exploration of interactions
              among observation, synthesis, and prediction. The utility of models for
              synthesis and prediction is obvious. The role of quantitative models in
              informing and guiding observation and experimentation is perhaps less often
              appreciated, but equally valuable. The conference is being hosted by the
              Institute of Ecosystem Studies and will take place May 1-3, 2001.
