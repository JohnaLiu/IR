Abstract    :
              Research will be carried out leading to an improvement in accuracy of
              the
neutron lifetime. A new cooling and trapping technique (developed by
              the
same researchers) will be used to aid in the measurment.  The
              lifetime
measurement will permit more precise tests of the standard model
              of
electroweak interactions. The experiment will be carried out at
              the
National Institute of Standards and Technology research reactor.
              This
activity is multidisciplinary, bringing together low
              temperature
techniques and nuclear physics techniques as well as understanding
              of
condensed matter, molecular and nuclear phenomena. The methods
              being
developed will also permit development of a new, intense source
              of
ultra-cold neutrons for further nuclear physics studies and for
              future
materials research studies. The lifetime measurement and the
              possible
study of correlations in neutron beta-decay are high priority
              activities
in contemporary nuclear physics and studies of fundamental
              symmetries.
Improvement of existing state-of-the-art equipment is integral to
              this
activity. Education of graduate and undergraduate students and postdocs
              is
a strong component in every aspect of this grant.
