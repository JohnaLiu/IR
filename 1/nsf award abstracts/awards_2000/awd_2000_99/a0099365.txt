Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for the research program of the high energy
              physics group at the University of Kansas, for work on the D0 experiment at
              Fermilab and also for work on the CLEO experiment at the Cornell University
              CESR electron-positron collider.  The upgraded D0 detector has just begun
              taking data at the world's energy frontier in the long-anticipated Run II at
              the Fermilab Tevatron proton-antiproton collider.  In addition to searches for
              new phenomena beyond the minimal Standard Model, e.g., for the Higgs boson or
              for supersymmetric partners to the known particles, the D0 experiment will make
              precision measurements in top-quark physics, W and Z physics, QCD, and b-quark
              physics.
	The Kansas group has played a leading role in building the silicon
              tracker for the D0 upgrade and is also responsible for the offline software
              support of the central preshower (CPS) detector.  This group will also align,
              calibrate, and fine-tune the CPS detector for maximal detection efficiency. 
              The group's expertise in b-quark physics, silicon, and preshower detectors will
              all be put to use in tagging jets containing a b-quark.  This is a crucial step
              in all new physics searches.  The Kansas group will also continue its analysis
              of CLEO data, especially in the area of charmed baryons, where they have
              traditionally played an important role.
