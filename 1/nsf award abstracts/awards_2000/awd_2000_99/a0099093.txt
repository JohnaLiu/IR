Abstract    :
              This project addresses two challenges in elementary school mathematics
              improvement.  First, it will provide a high quality mathematics curriculum that
              is aligned with national standards, promotes student understanding, and is
              acceptable to a wide range of elementary school teachers.  Second, it proposes
              to advance teachers' mathematical understanding as they teach, and to
              accomplish this goal without the additional cost of extensive professional
              development.  Following Liping Ma's belief that the right kinds of curriculum
              materials can help improve teachers' understanding of mathematics, the project
              will build on the existing Math Workshop materials to develop a dual-purpose
              curriculum, one that improves the understanding of both students and teachers. 
              The evaluation of the project will assess not only student learning, but will
              also include extensive analyses of how the instructional and professional
              development materials promote teacher understanding.
