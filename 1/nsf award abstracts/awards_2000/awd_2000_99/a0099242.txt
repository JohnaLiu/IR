Abstract    :
              
This ocean science technology development project builds on previous work
              developing instrumentation to measure light scattering and absorption in ocean
              water.  These variables are critical in determining the optical properties of
              the oceans, which has great applicability in making in situ measurements and in
              remote sensing of oceanic surface waters. Absorption is especially problematic,
              but newly developed instrumentation for such measurements has obtained reliable
              data in the spectral range of 380 nm to 700 nm. using isotropic illumination of
              the sample in an integrating cavity.  The goals of this project are: (1) to
              extend the capabilities of this previous instrumentation and make measurements
              in the ultraviolet spectral region in the 320 nm to 380-nm range; (2) to
              investigate the apparent fact that contact of ultra-pure water with glass and
              quartz leads to increased absorption of the ultra-pure water in the blue to
              near ultraviolet range; (3) to measure and improve the accuracy of the
              absorption coefficients in the important UV-C and UV-B spectral regions
              (specifically 240 nm to 320-nm); (4) to build and test a large spherical
              integrating cavity to provide higher accuracy in the absorption measurements at
              the minimum of pure water absorption; and (5) to study, build, and test a long
              tubular form of the integrating cavity with the objective of an in situ
              device.
