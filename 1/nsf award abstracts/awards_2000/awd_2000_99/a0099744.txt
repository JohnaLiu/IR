Abstract    :
              This award provides support for the acquisition of an isotope ratio mass
              spectrometer with elemental analyzer and gas-sampling peripherals for the
              Stable Isotope Ratio Facility for Environmental Research (SIRFER) at the
              University of Utah.  The Facility is a leader in the expansion of stable
              isotope analyses into ecological and environmental sciences, currently
              processing approximately 16,000 samples a year.  SIRFER now operates 4 isotope
              ratio mass spectrometers for ecological and environmental research that are
              available for use by investigators and students from the University of Utah and
              from other institutions throughout the nation.  In addition to purchase of the
              mass spectrometer, the award will enable purchase of peripherals to upgrade an
              existing mass spectrometer, a UV laser for ablation of carbonates, and a
              micromill for high-resolution sampling of tree rings.   The new equipment will
              permit compound-specific analyses at concentrations smaller than currently
              possible, determination of high resolution temporal - spatial information, use
              of laser-based high resolution approaches, and training of graduate students
              and postdoctoral fellows in these latest methods and instruments. 
              Isotope-ration mass spectometry plays an important role in modern ecological
              research aimed at measuring chemical constituents of existing and past
              environments, as well as the elemental makeup of living and fossilized
              organisms.
