Abstract    :
              This project involves conducting a field measurements program near Cherski,
              Siberia to quantify the impacts of disturbance on the seasonal cycle of
              atmospheric carbon dioxide and the discharge of carbon and nitrogen into the
              Arctic Ocean in forest and shrubby tundra regions.  Coastal plain tundra in the
              region has accumulated large stores of carbon in sediments during the
              Pleistocene that has been slowly released to the atmosphere and ocean through
              melting of previously frozen soils during the Holocene.  Disturbance,
              particularly forest fires, of the vegetation exposes the soils to accelerated
              carbon loss through more direct exposure to erosion.  The study will compare an
              undisturbed region to recently disturbed areas and determine the effects of 
              changes in temperature and hydrology on the rate of carbon flux.  The results
              will be utilized in models to examine possible future disturbance effects,
              particularly those that could be accelerated by warmer climate conditions.
