Abstract    :
              This project, at an RUI institution, provides undergraduate students with
              research experience through an active program in laser spectroscopy.  Students
              are actively involved in the study of optical properties of rare earth ions
              doped in crystalline host materials, and novel organic dyes in solid plastic
              materials.  Measurements include time-resolved spectroscopic techniques to
              study energy transfer characteristics and mechanisms.  Processes such as energy
              transfer between sensitizers and activators, fluorescence quenching, Stoke's
              shifts, and the effect of host materials on such processes are studied.  The
              research aims to help students understand and solidify their thinking about
              energy levels, selection rules, radiative and nonradiative processes.  Students
              actively participate in weekly group discussions interacting with fellow
              students and the PI.
%%%
The project is primarily oriented toward providing
              research education experience for undergraduates in materials physics studies
              including advanced characterization tools and analysis methods to address basic
              research issues in a topical area with technological relevance. The research
              will contribute basic materials science knowledge to important aspects of
              processing and fabricating photonic devices such as lasers and sensors. An
              important feature of the program is the way in which research and education are
              integrated through the training of students in basic research in a
              technologically significant area.
