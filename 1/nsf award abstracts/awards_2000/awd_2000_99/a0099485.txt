Abstract    :
              The goal of the proposed research it to produce a source of oxygen
14, a
              radioactive isotope of oxygen having a half-life of 70 seconds. 
If this
              development project is successful, the source will be used in a
future
              experiment designed to test one of the fundamental aspects of the
unified
              theory of the weak and electromagnetic interactions.  To perform
this
              experiment the source must have an activity of at least 100,000
decays per
              second, and for technical reasons must be deposited on a very thin
foil in an
              area of no more than a few square millimeters.  The weak
interaction
              experiment which we hope to carry out later will test what is
referred to as
              the Conserved Vector Current Hypothesis, and will involve
measuring the energy
              spectrum of the positrons emitted in the decay of oxygen
14.
