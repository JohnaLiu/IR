Title: "Building Capacity for a National
              Community College
Collaborative IT E-Learning Support Network for People
with
              Disabilities"

ABSTRACT

  The Education in Information Technology project
              (EDIT) represents a new partnership of some of the nation's leading
              informational technology providers in support of people with disabilities. 
              Western Michigan University and the Association of Rehabilitation Programs in
              Computer Technology (ARPCT) form a partnership to combine the hardware and
              software of IBM with the courseware of Smartforce.com to focus on a research
              initiative.  EDIT will develop an E-learning Internet support network to study
              the impact of using a collaborative Internet site to increase the educational
              capacity of community colleges for preparing students with disabilities for
              information technology related careers.  Ten of 50 ARPCT member programs are
              already located in community colleges, and efforts will be made to increase
              this number.  IBM and Smartforce.com have donated over $500,000, in product,
              support and courseware, to initiate the effort.  This project will develop the
              site, promote its use, and conduct rigorous research on its impact for
              assisting community colleges to build their capacity for preparing students
              with disabilities for information technology related careers.  The
              effectiveness of community colleges using a national collaborative E-learning
              site to improve their ability to prepare more students with disabilities will
              be tested, and results will be disseminated widely.
