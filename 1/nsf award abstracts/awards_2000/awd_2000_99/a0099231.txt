Abstract    :
              The goals of this proposal are to understand the Os abundances and 187Os/188Os
              of the ocean as well as the fluxes of Os into and out of the oceans, needed to
              determine the geochemical budget of Os in the oceans, its residence time and
              the possible utility of Os data for paleoclimatic studies. Analyses will be
              carried out for hydrothermal fluids from Juan de Fuca, organic-rich black
              shales, tributaries of the Orinoco river, and Mn crusts and nodules in order to
              constrain the budget of Os in the oceans.
