              ABSTRACT

OCE-0099027


Although geochemists know that sunlight-induced
              photochemical reactions involving dissolved colored organic matter (CDOM) are
              ubiquitous in natural waters everywhere, observational difficulties have
              dictated that the detailed study of the underlying reaction mechanisms has been
              largely confined to the laboratory.  The two principal laboratory techniques --
              laser flash photolysis (LFP) and steady-state probes (SS-P) used to trigger
              photolysis imply reactions such as

CDOM   +   hn     @   CDOM+  +   
              eaq-

where hn represents a photon  impinging upon a reactive site in the
              CDOM molecular structure, and eaq-  is a hydrated electron ejected into
              solution as a consequence.     However, investigators have been puzzled that
              LFP is significantly more efficient that SS-P in hydrated electron production. 
              LFP is an important tool for photochemical research, so it is important to
              understand the discrepancy.

In this project, researchers at the Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution, Brandeis University, and the University of Maryland
              combine efforts to re-evaluate the key reaction (above) by comparing LFP and
              SS-P data for samples from fresh and estuarine waters.  The comparative studies
              would be calibrated using compounds with well-characterized photochemical
              properties,  The focus would then shift to detailed comparative studies of
              estuarine and terrestrial CDOM fractions.  If possible, unprocessed water
              samples would also be examined.
