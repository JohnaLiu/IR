Abstract    :
              This project will employ an integrated program of mesocosm and field experiments
              to determine the influence of grazer diversity on trophic processes (plant
              productivity and functional group composition, secondary production, and
              trophic transfer) in beds of eelgrass (Zostera niarina), an important
              ecological engineer in coastal regions throughout the northern hemisphere.
              Vegetated estuarine systems are particularly suited to addressing links between
              grazer diversity and ecosystem processes because of the well documented impacts
              of grazers on both plant assemblages and predator production in these systems,
              and their relatively rapid responses to manipulation. The investigator's
              previous research demonstrated that small invertebrate grazers can be pivotal
              in maintaining normal structure and function in this and other vegetated
              benthic ecosystems. Yet the importance of grazers in the context of the
              multi-level seagrass food webs remains poorly understood. Accordingly, the
              study three goals:  1) to test the relative importance of grazing and resource
              limitation to structure and function of eelgrass communities, and the role of
              grazer diversity in mediating them; 2) to test the impact of grazer diversity
              on penetrance of the trophic cascade, using the eelgrass community as a model
              system; and 3) to test the hypothesized link between biodiversity and ecosystem
              stability by comparing variance in production and trophic processes across
              years and seasons as a function of grazer diversity.
