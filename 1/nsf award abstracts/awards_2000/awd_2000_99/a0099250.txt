Abstract    :
              This project continues research on the macroeconomic effects of New Deal labor
              and industrial policies using quantitative, dynamic, general equilibrium
              models. The U.S. economy remained substantially depressed long after the trough
              of the Great Depression in 1933. Hours worked per adult in 1939 were about 22
              percent below its 1929 level, and real GNP in 1939 was about 26 percent below
              its trend-adjusted 1929 level. This slow recovery has long puzzled economists;
              the economy experienced several positive shocks after 1933 that should have
              fostered a healthy recovery. Productivity and the money supply both grew
              rapidly after 1933, and banking panics and deflation, which are considered to
              be major depressing shocks between before1933, ended in 1933. Some economists,
              including Robert Lucas, Milton Friedman, and Armen Alchian, have suggested that
              New Deal policies, such as the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) and the
              National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which raised prices and wages, may have
              been an important contributing factor to the persistence of the Depression. 
              The goal of the research, which is joint with Harold Cole of the Minneapolis
              Fed, is to quantitatively evaluate for the first time the macroeconomic impact
              of these policies on the U.S. in the 1930s and 1940s using a plausibly
              parameterized dynamic, general equilibrium model. The research combines
              detailed empirical documentation of the effects of policies on wages and
              prices, and the development of new quantitative theory that captures the main
              features of these policies.   These data suggest that New Deal policies created
              a significant insider-outsider friction in the economy.  The key innovation in
              the dynamic general equilibrium macroeconomic model is incorporating a dynamic
              bargaining game between workers and firms in the model. 
The equilibrium path
              of the model economy is computed between 1934 and 1939, and is compared to the
              actual time path of the U.S. economy.  A plausibly parameterized version of the
              benchmark model indicates that New Deal policies were an important contributing
              factor to the persistence of the Depression. In particular, the predicted
              equilibrium path of the model economy between 1934 and 1939 is quite similar to
              that in the data; the model predicts a partial recovery beginning in 1934, and
              also predicts that the recovery stalls shortly afterwards, leaving output about
              14 percent below its normal level.

The project also makes theoretical and
              empirical extensions of the basic analysis. One extension allows for
              "industry-specific" capital that creates a "hold-up" problem in that labor can
              appropriate some of the returns to physical investment. This allows the model
              to capture more aspects of 1930s labor/firm bargaining, and also enriches the
              model so it can be applied more broadly to general equilibrium studies of
              unions, hold-up problems, and European insider/outsider frictions. Another
              extension allows for time variation in the effects of policy. The baseline
              model treats policy as coming from a single regime. Labor bargaining power
              increased in 1937, which was followed by a general reversal of New Deal
              policies during World War II. Modeling these shifts in policy allows the
              investigators to examine how policy variation contributed to two key
              fluctuations during this period: the Recession of 1938, and the economic boom
              of World War II.
