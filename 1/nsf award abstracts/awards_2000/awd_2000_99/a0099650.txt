Abstract    :
              This proposal from Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi (TAMU-CC) targets a
              large area and a significant number of school districts in South Texas, known
              as the Valley region.  The proposed work is organized around four partnership
              activities:

District and Community Forum to allow STRSI staff to explain the
              reform activities and gain the acceptance and cooperation of the school and
              community (especially parental) stakeholders.

Systemic Leadership Institute
              to annually gather the district Leadership Teams for improving team capacity
              and for team networking.

Teacher Partner Academy for leadership, content,
              and pedagogy training for the master teacher who provide the principal
              intervention in the schools.

Administrative Partner Academy to ensure
              administrative support and leadrship for the reform.
