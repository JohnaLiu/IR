This study sets out to better constrain the
              global biogeochemical cycle of methane, CH4, by a consideration of the isotopic
              composition of oceanic source end members. Recent renewed interest in several
              aspects of the  geochemistry of marine methane clathrates poses a number of
              intriguing problems that the  proposed isotopic information is likely to
              inform.  Methane, in the form of submarine gas hydrates, potentially represents
              the largest known reservoir of hydrocarbons on the planet. It is important to
              fully understand the methane cycle in the oceans for at least two reasons, i)
              evaluation of its potential as an energy source, and ii) evaluation of the
              propensity of its past and future outgassings from the ocean to effect large
              scale climatic change. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, with a radiative
              impact approx. 25 times that of CO2. The investigators on this project will
              measure the natural isotopic composition of methane (d 13C-CH4 and d 2H-CH4  in
              addition to some measurements of D 14C-CH4) from the water column as well as
              suspected end-member sources in sediments in order to construct composition
              mixing models. The work takes advantage of the restricted circulation of anoxic
              basins such as the Black Sea, using the overlying water column to integrate the
              effects of different sources of and processes taking place on CH4 as it passes
              through the water column. The study will build on and extend preliminary
              measurements on  d 13C-CH4 and d 2H-CH4  made on samples collected from a 1988
              Black Sea expedition.
