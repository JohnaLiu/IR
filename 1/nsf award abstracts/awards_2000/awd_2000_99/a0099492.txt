Abstract    :
              This experimental and computational research program continues the investigation
              of Rydberg atoms and molecules in electric fields using the technique of
              recurrence spectroscopy.  Quantum mechanical atomic wavefunctions do not
              provide the means to easily visualize the dynamics of an atom, whereas
              recurrence spectroscopy, combined with semiclassical theory, provides a
              physical understanding of the motion of the Rydberg electron through its
              classical orbits.   Recurrence spectroscopy will be used to investigate
              recurrences above the classical ionization threshold as well as recurrences
              resulting from higher excited initial states and recurrences of higher angular
              momentum states.  These studies will be undertaken on helium, complex atoms,
              and simple molecules.  A strong interaction between experimentalists and
              theorists is a hallmark of the program.
