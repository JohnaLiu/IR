Abstract    :
              The project is concerned with the study and simulation of low energy
nuclear
              reactions during the post-main sequence phase of stellar
evolution. The
              particular goal is the measurement of helium burning
direction in Red Giant
              stars and hydrogen and helium burning processes in
Asymptotic Giant (AGB)
              stars. This information is necessary for the
interpretation of observational
              data on isotopic and elemental abundance
distribution in the atmospheres of
              Red Giants and in the planetary nebulae
surrounding AGB stars.  The
              determination of these processes is not only
important for the understanding
              of nucleosynthesis mechanisms but also for
the interpretation of fast
              dredge-up and convection processes in these
The experiments are performed at
              the Notre Dame low energy KN accelerator
which is dedicated for nuclear
              astrophysics measurements.
