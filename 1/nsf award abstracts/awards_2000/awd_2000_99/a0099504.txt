Abstract    :
              The subject of this work is the dynamics of simple atomic systems subject to
              strong time-dependent perturbations, as in the classical quantum correspondence
              of highly excited atomic systems and in the interplay between strong external
              perturbations and internal electron-electron correlations.  Projects are (1)
              the evolution of highly excited Rydberg atoms under the influence of ultrashort
              high intensity electric field pulses and (2) electron correlation and
              two-electron processes in quantum dots driven by terahertz pulses
