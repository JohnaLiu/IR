Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical phusics will focus on improving our understanding
of
              elementary particles, their interactions, and their relevance to
astrophysics
              and cosmology. Plausible extensions of today's very well
confirmed "standard
              model" of the elementary particles will be constructed
in order to resolve
              such outstanding questions as the contrasting and
unexplained patterns of
              neutrino and quark masses, especially the
underlying mechanisms producing
              these masses; the nature of the dark
matter and dark energy that now dominate
              the dynamics of the universe; the
origin of cosmic rays with energies beyond
              what was expected; the failure
to detect any electric dipole moment of the
              neutron and the apparent
departure of the recently-observed magnetic moment of
              the muon from its
predicted value.
