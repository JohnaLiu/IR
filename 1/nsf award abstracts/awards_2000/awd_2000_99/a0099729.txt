Several studies will be undertaken
              in order to understand the interaction between hadrons in a nuclear setting. 
              It is intended to test the idea that the same effective potentials which are
              used for interactions between nucleons can be used for interactions between
              other hadrons.  Cases to be considered include proton-proton, pion-nucleon,
              nucleon-nucleon, lamda-nucleon, and pion-pion interactions.
