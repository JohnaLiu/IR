The principal topics proposed for continued research arise
              from statistical mechanics. They include i) the possible relation of the
              thermodynamic arrow of time to large scale features of the universe and ii) a
              "master equation" method appropriate to nonequilibrium statistical mechanics
              which allows the PI to address questions of complexity in open systems.  Other
              topics include path integrals, and deviations from exponential decay.
