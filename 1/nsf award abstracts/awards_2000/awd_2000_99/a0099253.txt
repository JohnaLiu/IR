Abstract    :
              0099253/Winters

This study examines the role of internal waves in mixing near
              source 
regions of internal waves by studying several different types of
              
non-linear internal-wave interaction problems. Numerical experiments 
will
              be used to examine three different regimes.  The first will look 
at the
              nonlinear cascade of energy between short and long internal 
waves in a
              run-down experiment initialized with a high-energy, 
random-phase internal
              wave field with a spectrum similar to that 
postulated by Garrett and Munk. 
              The second set of experiments will 
look at energy transfer from internal
              waves at the frequency of the M2 
tide, forced by tidal excursions over
              topography, to higher frequency 
internal waves when that tranfer is catalyzed
              by the presence of a 
background field of internal waves.  The third focus is
              on interactions 
between wind-forced near-inertial waves and non-inertial
              internal waves.  
The numerical experiments will be conducted with a
              three-dimensional, 
non-hydrostatic, psuedospectral code.  The numerical
              results will be 
compared to field data collected during a variety of prior
              oceanic and 
coastal experiments.
