This award to Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia
              University in the City of New York provides instrumentation to significantly
              improve the navigation capabilities of the research vessel Maurice Ewing, an
              NSF-owned ship operated by LDEO as part of the University-National
              Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  The navigation and quality
              control software and instrumentation supported here will allow major
              improvements to survey operations for geophysical research.  Other items,
              including spare magnetometer and upgrades to the shipboard computing network,
              computers and peripherals, will modernize these systems and improve
              capabilities provided to shared-use researchers funded by NSF from throughout
              the U.S.  These improvements will be of substantial advantage to marine
              scientists using the ship in their research during 2001 and future
              years.
