Abstract    :
              In 2000 an array of acoustic extensiometers was deployed at the south Cleft
              segment of the Juan de Fuca Ridge.  These instruments are designed to precisely
              measure horizontal distances across the axis of the ridge to detect and
              quantify seafloor speading events.  Eleven instruments were deployed in
              permanent seafloor benchmarks.  The instruments make daily measurements of
              distance to their neighbors in the array by recording the round trip travel
              time of acoustic pulses.  Temperature is measured to corect the ranges for
              sound speed variations, and pressure was measured at each benchmark to monitor
              for veritical deformation.
