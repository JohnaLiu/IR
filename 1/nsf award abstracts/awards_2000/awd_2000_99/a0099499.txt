Fuller
Prof. Fuller proposes to continue his investigations on a wide
              range of problems involving neutrino physics, nuclear astrophysic sand
              cosmology. The PI has obtained seminal results which examine possible links
              between neutrino processes (masses, mixing and possible "sterile" neutrinos)
              and processes such as supernova explosions, r-process nucleosynthesis and
              big-bang nucleosynthesis. Current experiments suggest strongly that neutrinos
              have mass, and the PI's prior and proposed research has the potential to make
              fascinating new connections between these diverse areas of astrophysics and
              neutrino reactions.
