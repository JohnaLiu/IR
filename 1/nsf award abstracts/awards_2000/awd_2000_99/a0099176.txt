Abstract    :
              The goal of this study is to evaluate whether 231Pa/230Th can be used as a
              nutrient-independent measure of the vigor of thermohaline circulation in the
              ocean. 231Pa has a residence time similar to the time scale of NADW (N. Atl.
              Deep Water), whereas 230Th has a much shorter residence time. Because of this,
              231 Pa is exported from the Atlantic into CPDW; the 231Pa/230Th of sediments in
              the Atlantic reflect the extent of export and thus the vigor of THC. The ratio
              will be measured in sediments from 12 areas of the Atlantic with ICPMS to look
              at changes in the THC from Holocene and glacial times. The data will be used to
              constrain circulation models.
