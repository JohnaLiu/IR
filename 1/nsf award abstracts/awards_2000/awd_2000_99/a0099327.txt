Abstract    :
              The nature of the magnetic Jurassic Quiet Zone is unresolved because Jurassic
              ocean crust occurs in only a few locations.  New results have been obtained at
              Ocean Drilling Project Hole 801C suggesting up to six polarity reversals or
              intensity events within the Jurassic.  This project will conduct a nested set
              of near-bottom deeptow magnetic profiles encompassing the region around 801C
              and then expanding out to extend the existing 1992 deeptow lines south to the
              magnetic rough-smooth boundary which is thought to define the end of the
              spreading sequence in the area.  The deeptowed magnetic survey will boost the
              signal to noise ratio, reduce the diurnal noise problem and mitigate the
              attenuation due to water depth.
