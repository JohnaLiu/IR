Abstract    :
               

Electrochemical capacitor (EC) energy technologies, including double layer
              capacitor (DLC) and electrochemical double layer capacitor (EDLC) have
              promising potential in electric vehicles (EV) or hybrid vehicles. The most
              important advantages of EC are their high power and energy densities. Other EC
              advantages include long cycle life (100,000 - 1,000,000 cycles) and
              maintenance-free property.
The energy density of EC mainly depends on specific
              capacitance and applied voltage. The maximum capacitance of EC is limited by
              the concentration of ions in the electrolyte. The key to increase the energy
              density of the electrochemical capacitors seems to rest in the increases in the
              electrochemical windows and ionic concentrations of the electrolytes, and
              improvement of mass transfer in metal oxide film. 
The project objectives
              include: 
Development of novel electrodes: Composite electrodes composed of
              carbon and nano-film of metal oxide will be investigated. 
Development of
              novel electrolytes: Organic liquids as electrolytes will be investigated.
              
Modeling and investigation of charge-discharge mechanisms. 

Current metal
              oxide film used in EC has micrometer thickness and the fabrication is
              complicated. In this research, a novel oxide film processing method is
              proposed. By adsorbing metal to activated carbon and then modifying it to metal
              oxide, the new method will produce nano-meter-thick metal oxide film, having
              high energy density and low internal resistance.
The theoretical analysis and
              preliminary experiments were conducted and specific energy was calculated.
              Theoretical energy density of 1600-2000 Wh/kg was obtained for electrochemical
              capacitor unit using ionic liquids.
It is anticipated that the goals outlined
              in this proposal will lead to the development of a new capacitor with high
              power and energy densities.
