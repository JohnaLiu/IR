Abstract    :
              The main thrust of this project is to continue recent advances in atomic
              experiments designed to find and measure violations of parity and time-reversal
              symmetries.  A major effort is the search for a permanent atomic electric
              dipole moment (EDM), which can exist only if time-reversal symmetry is
              violated.   This will be done with a mercury EDM experiment, which has reached
              such a level of sensitivity that it is now possible to make an exacting test of
              low energy supersymmetry and other models in which T-violation would occur
              naturally.   At the same time, an experiment with optically cooled and trapped
              diamagnetic atoms, chiefly ytterbium and radium, will be used to explore a
              possible new realm of EDM sensitivity.  Other related efforts include parity
              nonconservation (PNC) experiments in thallium and the development of a new PNC
              experiment with a singly ionized barium ion.
