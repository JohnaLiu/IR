Abstract    :
              
A field experiment is proposed, which will provide multi-year time series of
              salt, heat, and mass transports from the Agulhas retroflection region into the
              South Atlantic subtropical gyre.  The program will deploy inverted echo
              sounders, both with and without pressure sensors and near-bottom current
              meters. The in situ data will be complemented with satellite data, both SST and
              altimetry.  Historical data will also be included in the data analysis.  The
              success of the program is based substantially on a new technique, GEM-ETTA, for
              analyzing IES (inverted echo sounder) and PIES (pressure and inverted echo
              sounder) data.  Analysis of the field data in conjunction with reanalysis of
              historical data will provide the first long-term time series of these
              inter-basin fluxes on interannual scales.
