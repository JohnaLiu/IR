Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop an approach to policy evaluation that
              combines the best features of the structural and treatment effects approach, by
              putting more economics into the treatment effects approach and at the same time
              producing a more robust statistical approach to structural policy evaluation. A
              latent variable modeling framework is  used to formulate and estimate
              structural models and reduce the dimensionality of the estimation problem in
              conducting nonparametric analyses of treatment effects. 
    The research
              represents an extension of previous work by the investigators, and the goal is
              to produce an economically interpretable earnings function that can be used to
              evaluate alternative public policies designed to foster human capital. The
              earnings function is also nested within a dynamic general equilibrium model of
              earnings, schooling, and capital formation.
