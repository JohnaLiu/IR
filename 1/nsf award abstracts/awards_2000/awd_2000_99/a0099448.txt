Abstract    :
              
	Nuclear beta decay was important in motivating the Standard Model, and
it
              continues to be of importance in searches for physics beyond the Standard
              Model.
The simplest system for studying beta decay is the neutron.  By
              measuring the
neutron's lifetime (from the Ft value) and the neutron's beta
              asymmetry A, one
has enough information to independently determine the weak
              vector and axial-vector
couplings, GV  and GA. 
	An approved experiment
              (located at Los Alamos) will again measure the A coefficient,
utilizing
              Ultra-Cold Neutrons (UCN), dramatically reducing systematic errors
              otherwise
present due to beam-induced backgrounds and incomplete polarization.
               The key
features are 1) the ability to port the neutrons to a significant
              distance away
from their production site, 2) vetoing events when the beam
              pulse is on target,
and 3) obtain 100% polarization using an axial magnetic
              field.
	This proposal covers efforts to develop an optimum coating
              for
transporting polarized neutrons, and implementing a suitable DAQ system
              for the experiment.
It appears pulsed-laser-deposition (PLD) diamond films may
              be suitable.
A successful campaign to make suitably coated guides would
              have
an significant impact, not just for this experiment, but planned
              future
experiments as well.
