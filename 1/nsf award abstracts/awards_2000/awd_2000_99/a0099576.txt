Abstract    :
              This continuing project on quantum fluctuations in the radiation field will
              study the initiation of directed collective spontaneous emission from excited
              two-state atoms, conditional homodyne detection, and non-Gaussian fluctuations
              of nonlinear and noisy quantum systems, as realized in cavity quantum
              electrodynamics (QED). It will include an international collaboration with
              Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, involving short term exchange visits
              for graduate students and postdocs.
