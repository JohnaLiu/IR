In this project, a plan is outlined to continue the efforts
              of the Student Meeting Activities Subcommittee of the Power Engineering
              Education Committee of the IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) to promote
              student interest in the power engineering field by sponsoring electrical
              engineering students from US universities to attend the IEEE PES annual Winter
              Meeting to be held in Columbus, Ohio.  The goal of this project is to provide
              an opportunity for students to be exposed to the most recent developments in
              design, operation, construction, and research in the power engineering field. 
              This is a particularly critical time for power engineering as the industry
              undergoes significant change due to the restructuring of the traditional
              utility structure.  The career opportunities for students interested in power
              engineering are many and varied; the program offers student several
              opportunities to interact with practicing engineers from utilities, vendors,
              manufacturers, and consulting firms.
