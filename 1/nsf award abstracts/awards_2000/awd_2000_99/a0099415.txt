Abstract    :
              This project deals with the structure of minimal free resolutions and their
              applications in algebraic geometry. The P.I. will conduct research on the
              following topics :
    1) connectedness and smoothness of Hilbert schemes over
              exterior algebras  (joint with M. Stillman);
    2) the asymptotic  properties
              and structure of free resolutions over complete intersections;
   3) free 
              resolutions over rings with restricted powers (joint with V. Gasharov and T.
              Hibi).

The proposed research is in the closely related fields of commutative
              algebra and algebraic geometry.  These fields study the algebraic invariants of
              systems of polynomial equations and the geometry of sets defined by the
              vanishing of polynomials.  Usually  it is  very difficult to find explicitly
              the solutions of a system of polynomial equations; however one can study the
              geometric properties of the set of solutions.  Some of the results in these
              fields have applications in communications and robotics.
