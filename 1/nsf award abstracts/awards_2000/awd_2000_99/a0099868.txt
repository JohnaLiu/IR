The goal of this project is to develop robust nanocomposite
              molecular coatings of advanced polymers with controlled mechanical and
              tribological properties.  These coatings would serve to enhance the performance
              of microdevices such as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) by improving
              their resistance to contact deformation and friction and by providing
              controllable surface nanomechanical properties.  The approach is to combine
              two-step self-assembly and grafting routines to fabricate multifunctional
              coatings from advanced polymeric materials with appropriate nanomechanical
              properties.  The chemical grafting of the polymer layers onto the
              functionalized silion surface will then be explored in order to produce wear
              resistant and superelastic coatings.  A grafted rubber matrix will be
              reinforced by interconnected glassy nanodomains to enhance its wear resistance.
               The grafting technique will also be used to grow nanocomposite brush layers
              with two dissimilar polymers, soft-hard alternating, and with reversible
              adaptive intralayer reorganization.  Mapping of mechanical properties will be
              done with a nanoprobing/nanoindentation technique adapted for compliant
              coatings.

Robust, uniform, nanometer thick polymer coatings which are
              uniformly and firmly anchored to solid surfaces and which have low adhesion
              energy and variable elastic modulus and wettability are expected to be highly
              beneficial for the operation of nano- and microdevices in real world
              applications, where they are exposed to humid air and bio and chemo fluids. 
              This will expand the application range of these devices significantly.
