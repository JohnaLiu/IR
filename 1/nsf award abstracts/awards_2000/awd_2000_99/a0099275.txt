This project will support processing and analysis of data
              from the 
Denmark Strait Overflow, collected during an expedition to the
              Denmark 
Strait.  These data will be used to produce a description of the
              
energetics, eddy characteristics and basic dynamical parameters of the
              
Denmark Strait Overflow.  The results will be used to test the 
predictions
              of existing theories of hydraulic control in dense 
overflows.  The observed
              data will also be used to examine the structure 
of eddies in the Denmark
              Strait.  The properties of the flow in and near 
the eddies will be compared
              with three existing theories of eddy 
formation in an effort to determine
              which one is most applicable to the 
Denmark Strait.
