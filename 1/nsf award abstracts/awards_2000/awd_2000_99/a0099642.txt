Abstract    :
              I plan on working on the following specific problems.  First I would like to
              prove new Strichartz estimates without using explicit parametrices.  This could
              potentially greatly widen the scope of their applications.  I would also like
              to prove almost global existence for quasilinear wave equations and investigate
              whether there is global existence for nonlinear wave equations outside of
              nontrapping obstacles.  I would like to use the techniques developed on these
              projects to study problems in relativity theory, including the stability of the
              Schwarzschild solution.  Finally, I would like to continue my work on problems
              in harmonic analysis that arise in geometrical situations.

The above
              problems arise naturally from interactions between mathematics and areas in
              physics that include general relativity, quantum mechanics, and quantum chaos. 
              The techniques employed include stationary phase and the study of propagation
              of singularities.  There is a very active group of researchers in quantum
              physics groups at major universities studying high-energy eigenstates, and I am
              especially interested in making further contributions to this area.
