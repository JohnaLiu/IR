Abstract    :
              This one year proposal will explore how to create very large area plasmas.  The
              focus is on sustaining plasmas with electron series resonant (ESR) surface
              waves (SWP).  

Part I of the proposed investigation tackles open theoretical
              questions concerning devices large enough to support very long wavelength
              surface waves.

Part II investigates the use of surface waves for electron
              energy distribution (EEDF) control (i.e. selective heating and cooling) in
              plasmas.

Part III will look into bow to distribute power fed into ESR-SWP's
              for creating large area uniform plasmas.  The initial approach will be to feed
              discharge power into the ESR-SWP by a distributed  excitation using a
              directionally coupled slow waveguide.
