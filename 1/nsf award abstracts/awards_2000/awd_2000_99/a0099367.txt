Abstract    :
              This is a proposal to analyze the AMANDA II data to search for neutrinos from
              Gamma Ray Bursters and for high energy neutrinos.  This group will also perform
              the necessary simulation and calibration work required by this search.  Some of
              the work will need to be done at the South Pole.
