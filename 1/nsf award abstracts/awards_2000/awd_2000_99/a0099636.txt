Abstract    :
              The project focuses on a system for bringing enhanced tactile sensitivity and
              dexterity to supervised tele-manipulation. The proposed structure will utilize
              a combination of tactile, force, audio, and visual feedback channels between a
              human operator and a slave system consisting of a robot arm manipulator and a
              multi-fingered hand. The proposed approach builds on upon existing work in
              grasping and dexterous manipulation, telemanipulation, and tactile sensing.
              Future applications of this work  include, maintenance, repair, exploration,
              and salvage operation in remote and hazardous environments.
