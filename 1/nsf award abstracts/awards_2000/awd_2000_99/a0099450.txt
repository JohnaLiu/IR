The physics of hadronic and gluonic excitations, such as
              hybrid hadrons, glueballs, and the N* resonances, will be studied using
              computer simulations of quarks and gluons on a space-time lattice.  Little is
              currently known about such systems, but their existence is suggested by quantum
              chromodynamics (QCD), the field theory believed to describe the strong
              interactions. These excitations should also yield vital clues to the elusive
              mechanism of quark confinement and the nature of the QCD vacuum.  The
              motivation for these studies is the experimental program at Jefferson
              Laboratory, in particular the N* program in Hall B and the proposed Hall D
              photoproduction of gluonic excitations.
