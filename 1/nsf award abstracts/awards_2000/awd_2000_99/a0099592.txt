Abstract    :
              Multi-electron process in slow highly charged ion-atom and ion-molecule
              collisions will be investigated by means of time-of-flight coincidence
              measurements of Auger electrons, scattered projectiles and target recoil ions
              or fragments.  In addition to the Auger electron energies, final projectile and
              recoil ion or fragment charge states, the measurements will simultaneously
              provide the Q-values or the kinetic energy release distributions and angular
              distribution information by means of recoil ion momentum spectroscopy.  The
              experiments will be carried out at the multi-charged ion research facility at
              the University of Nevada, Reno.
