Abstract    :
              This project will study several situations in algebraic geometry where, for
              reasons connected with mirror symmetry, spaces defined in terms of a Lie group
              are expected to have enumerative or cohomological invariants which are related,
              or equal, to those where the group is replaced by its Langlands dual.  The aim
              is to compute these invariants and verify the predictions of mirror symmetry. 
              Among the principal examples to be studied are: (1) the stringy Hodge
              polynomials of the spaces of flat connections on a Riemann surface with
              structure group a reductive Lie group; (2) the stringy Hodge polynomials of the
              moduli spaces of solutions to Nahm's equations of magnetic monopoles; (3) the
              quantum cohomology of a loop group.

This is research in algebraic geometry,
              one of the most classical parts of mathematics, concerned with finding
              solutions of polynomial equations.  But it is aimed at corroborating some very
              recent hypotheses about mirror symmetry, an exciting idea which has lately
              emerged from theoretical physics.  Mirror symmetry proposes that certain string
              theories about the fundamental structure of the universe can be formulated
              mathematically in two seemingly different but equivalent ways.  This project
              will explore the evidence supporting one of the recent suggestions for how to
              construct one of these formulations in terms of the other.
