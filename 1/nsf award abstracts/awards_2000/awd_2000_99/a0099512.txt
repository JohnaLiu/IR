Abstract    :
              In order to determine the number of employees, the job skills, and the
              educational preparation that the aquarium and marine interpretation industry
              needs in its workforce in the Pacific Northwest and nationally, and to plan a
              degree program that addresses this need, this project is conducting a
              comprehensive survey of the field, including aquariums, interpretive centers,
              fish and wildlife agencies, and aquaculture facilities. Based on the survey
              results, the project is developing outlines of potential academic programs that
              are of interest to the local and national industry and examining existing
              curricular materials to determine what materials can be adapted for this
              purpose and what new materials need to be developed.
