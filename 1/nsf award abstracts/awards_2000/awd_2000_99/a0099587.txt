Abstract    :
              A series of experimental investigations of light scattering will be undertaken. 
               At lower atomic density, or larger detunings from atomic resonance, the
              polarization and frequency dependence of the scattering cross section will be
              used to extract data on the dipole transition matrix elements for transitions
              out of the ground and excited levels of the atoms.   Transition matrix elements
              measured in this way serve as benchmarks for sophisticated atomic structure
              calculations, and they provide data useful to interpretation of atomic parity
              violation experiments.   At high atomic density, multiple light scattering
              dominates, and the scattering is macroscopically strong.  Investigation of
              these multiple scattering effects also forms part of the project.
