Abstract    :
              The dynamics of the relativistic two-body problem will be studied in
the limit
              where one of the bodies is very much more massive than the
other. The extreme
              mass ratio is amenable to analytic treatment, and
can be used to describe a
              neutron star or similar object interacting
with a super-massive galactic black
              hole. The primary questions to be
addressed concern the dynamical stability of
              the orbits and the
transition from inspiral to plunge. This should shed light
              on our
ability to extract information from the gravitational waves
              emitted
during the final stages of the orbital evolution. A variety of
              new
and existing techniques will be developed and applied.

The evolution of
              two masses under their mutual gravitational attraction
is a major outstanding
              problem in classical general relativity. It has
a direct bearing on the
              observational program of the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational wave
              Observatory (LIGO). The possibly that the orbital
evolution is effectively
              chaotic has a number of interesting theoretical
and observational
              consequences.
