Abstract    :
              The investigator  will work on further development and applications of his
              powerful geometric machinery of graded diagrams which was created to solve the
              famous Burnside problem (posed in 1902) on periodic groups of sufficiently
              large even exponents.  In particular, he will extend the framework of the main
              induction construction of this machinery to obtain more results on groups whose
              defining relators are nth powers.  In addition, he will work on a generalized
              version of the Hanna Neumann conjecture on subgroups of free groups and
              long-standing Stallings' problem on presentations of the trivial group.

This
              research is in combinatorial group theory which studies groups defined by means
              of generators and defining relators and is at the intersection of the theory of
              groups with low dimensional topology, geometry, and mathematical logic.  The
              theory of groups is a  mathematical theory of symmetry which interacts with
              many other disciplines, for example, physics and chemistry outside of
              mathematics, coding theory, number theory, topology and geometry inside
              mathematics.
