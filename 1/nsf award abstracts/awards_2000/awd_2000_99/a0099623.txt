Abstract    :
              This grant provides support for young investigators to attend the 2001
              Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) Summer
              Research Conference on Biological Methylation to be held on July 21-26, 2001,
              in Saxton River, VT. This conference is the fifth in a series of biennial
              conferences that began in 1993, under the auspices of the FASEB.  These
              conferences were organized in response to the need for a conference with a
              focus on S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), the methyl donor for most biological
              methylation reactions, and the various AdoMet-dependent transmethylation
              reactions in cells. Approximately half of  the 2001 meeting's sessions will be
              focused on the methylation of DNA, as DNA methylation  has been shown to play
              important roles in the regulation of gene expression, imprinting and
              tumorigenesis.  Other topics to be discussed at the meeting include the AdoMet
              and human health, various protein methylation reactions involved in aging and
              gene expression, and small molecule methylation reactions important in
              chemotherapy.  This Conference provides a unique opportunity for scientists
              interested in various aspects of AdoMet methylation and AdoMet metabolism to
              interact, which is not achieved at any other conference. Consequently, this
              meeting has traditionally provided the starting point for productive
              collaborations.  The expertise of attendees varies widely, ranging from
              synthetic chemistry to molecular biology to physiology and medicine.
