Abstract    :
              Entanglement at the quantum level and chaos at the classical level are defining
              features of nonlinear systems with multiple degrees of freedom.  They will be
              studied in the real physical setting of the dynamics of ultracold atoms trapped
              in magneto-optical double-well potentials, examining quantum control, in
              connection with experiments of Jessen.  Another central objective is to study
              the nature of the transition from regular quantum dynamics to chaotic classical
              dynamics.
