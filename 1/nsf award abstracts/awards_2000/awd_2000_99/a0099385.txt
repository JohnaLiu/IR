There is increasing experimental evidence that neutrinos
              have mass, but there is serious need for information on the actual values of
              neutrino masses.  This proposal continues the study of effects which could
              influence the extraction of neutrino mass from an analysis of the electron
              energy spectrum very near the high-energy end point in nuclear beta decay.
              Scenarios alternative to Standard Model physics may also affect the electron
              spectrum and have further consequences such as an alteration of signals in
              solar neutrino detectors similar to what has been observed.  This investigation
              of neutrino properties could have profound effects on cosmology through the
              dark matter problem.
