Abstract    :
              This proposal combines an experimental program intended to fabricate
              proof-of-concept solid-state THz sources and evaluate their technological
              promise (in terms of real-world benchmarks, such as power output over the
              attainable freqcuency range). together with a theoretical effort intended to
              clarity the high-frequency generation mechanisms and guide the experimental
              work among different device geometries. This proposal will complete the
              envisioned program fully with regard to fabricating and characterizing
              proof-or-concept devices and developing the theoretical framework.
