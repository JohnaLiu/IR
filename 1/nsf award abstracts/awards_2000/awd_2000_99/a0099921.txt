Abstract    :
              This project will study several questions in partial differential
equations
              which lead to interesting questions in harmonic
analysis. The first set of
              questions are related to the inverse
conductivity problem as studied by
              Sylvester and Uhlmann. My main
interest is considering the a priori regularity
              assumption which seem
to be necessary to study this problem.  I propose a
              technique to
establish a uniqueness theorem in dimensions 3 and larger
              for
coefficients which only have one derivative. In addition, I will
consider
              the two-dimensional problem, where such a theorem is
known. In two dimensions,
              I propose to extend the result from
equations to systems. The second set of
              questions are related to the
mixed problem for Laplace's equation. The goal
              here is to obtain
optimal regularity results for solutions to these problems.
              Examples
indicate that the positive result depend strongly on the geometry
              of
the domain and the sets where Dirichlet and Neumann data are
posed.

The
              inverse conductivity problem is a mathematical formulation of the
problem of
              determining the interior physical properties of an object
by making electrical
              measurements at the boundary. This and related
problems are of practical
              importance in medical imaging and in the
nondestructive evaluation of
              materials. The theoretical investigations
proposed in this project may shed
              some light on how to improve
practical implementation of these problems.  The
              mixed problem for
Laplace's equation models the problem of determining the
              temperature
in the interior of a solid where part of the boundary is
              insulated.
My research is focused on understanding how the geometry of
              the
region of the region affects our ability to solve this problem.
