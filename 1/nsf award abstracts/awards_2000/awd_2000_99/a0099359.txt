The objective of this proposal is to
              determine the chemical nature of high activity redox sites on zeolite
              catalysts.  In previous work the PI postulated the novel hypothesis that the
              anions, rather than the cations, were involved the redox activity.  A kinetic
              model involving nitrate and nitrite species was proposed to explain anomalous
              behavior above a certain partial pressure of reactant.  Specifically, it was
              found that the rate of decomposition of nitrous oxide over a zeolite catalyst
              jumped to a higher level when its partial pressure exceeded a critical value. 
              Because this phenomenon only occurred when the zeolite had been ion-exchange
              with iron, there is some interaction with the cation. The proposed research may
              reveal a new type of redox chemistry, which may be applied to the decomposition
              of NOx compounds as well as partial oxidation reactions.  The use of
              gravimetry, infrared spectroscopy, microcalorimetry, isotope-labeling studies,
              and detailed kinetic studies may reveal the nature and identity of the high
              activity redox sites.  This work has the potential to elucidate phenomena
              important in industrial and environmental applications including the selective
              catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides.
