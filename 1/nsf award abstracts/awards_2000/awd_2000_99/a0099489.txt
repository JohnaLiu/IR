Abstract    :
              This award supports two projects that focus on field-induced collective motion
              and quantum control in multi-electron and multi-atom systems.  The experiments
              employ intense femtosecond pulses to excite and control isolated systems, and
              imagining instrumentation to monitor quantitatively energy and angular
              correlation between simultaneously ejected components.  The subject of the
              first project is three-atom systems undergoing field-induced Coulomb explosion.
                The fact that the vibrational motion of linear and nonlinear triatomic
              molecules leads to different explosion dynamics will be exploited to control
              the branching ratio between explosion channels.  In the second project two-atom
              systems will be studied.  In particular, the coupling between the nuclear and
              electronic motion in the presence of strong laser fields will be investigated
              in the molecule HD.
