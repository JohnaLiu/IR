Abstract    :
              This award provides support for purchase of an Environmental Scanning Electron
              Microscope (ESEM) equipped with a Peltier cooling stage to be used by at least
              13 research groups in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and
              the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Harvard University.  This
              modern, multifunctional instrument will replace an existing, 25-year-old
              instrument which lacks the capacity for examining fully hydrated materials. The
              instrument will be available for use by students, research associates and
              faculty, insuring student training in use of a modern electron microscope. 
              Diverse research in the areas of organismic, evolutionary, and developmental
              biology will utilize this new equipment.  Initial uses include studies of the
              morphology of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, determination of the migration pathway
              of neural crest cells in amphibians, and studies of the mechanisms of xylem
              embolism repair and root water uptake in plants.   Such studies with the level
              of resolution provided by scanning electron microscopy were not possible until
              the development of instruments that did not use a low pressure or vacuum in the
              sample chamber.
