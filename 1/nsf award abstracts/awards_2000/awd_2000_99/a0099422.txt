Abstract    :
              
Research is carried out at medium energy electron accelerators, in particular
              the MIT/Bates Linear Accelerator Center. The goal is to use the precision and
              versatility of the electron probe to study the structure of matter. The energy
              of the accelerator is such that we can 'see' matter at distances where
              phenomena are governed by the strong nuclear force. Experiments are carefully
              designed to gain insight into the structure and dynamics of nuclear matter.
              This is a contemporary field of research that uses recent technological
              advances in the production of electron beams and nuclear targets coupled with
              specially designed detection systems. At the Bates Center we conduct
              experiments with multiple magnetic spectrometers capable of making high
              precision measurements to advance the science. We are also leading the
              construction of a new detector, the Bates Large Acceptance Spectrometer Toroid
              (BLAST). which is expected to start data taking in 2002. Up to date information
              in the development of these projects can be found at <http://mitbates.mit.edu>.
              Our research program under this grant provides an excellent environment for the
              educational development of students and postdoctoral personnel.
