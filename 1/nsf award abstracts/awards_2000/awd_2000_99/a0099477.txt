Abstract    :
              This program focuses on a series of experimental investigations of methods and
              applications of a technique for controlling optical interactions in atomic
              systems by taking advantage of the coherence properties of these interactions. 
               These Two-Pathway Coherent Control processes make use of an interference that
              occurs when optical interactions proceed via two distinct excitation routes in
              atomic, molecular, or condensed phase systems.  This interference has been
              shown to result in an enhancement or inhibition of excitation probabilities,
              control of the direction of propagation of photoelectrons or photoions, and
              control over the branching ratios of photoionization or photodissociation into
              different continuum channels.   The projects in the program include: 1) a
              series of measurements that will explore the role of autoionizing resonances on
              the phase of the interference; 2) development of a techniques for sensitive
              detection of weak optical transitions; and 3) detailed investigations of a
              robust form of interference that is insensitive to the phase of the laser
              field.
