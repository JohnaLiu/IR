Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on
M/Superstring
              Theory and related supergravity theories. The M/Superstring
Theory provides us
              with the only known consistent framework for
reconciling quantum mechanics
              with Einstein's theory of gravity and is a
very important, promising candidate
              for a successful unified theory of all
the forces of nature.The underlying
              fundamental symmetries of
M/Superstring Theory will be investigated and these
              symmetries will be
used to study the consequences of the theory such as the
              elementary
particles that the theory predicts. Mathematical techniques that
              are
essential for carrying out this program will be developed further. 
              At
certain low energy regimes, M/Superstring Theory can be
              effectively
described by "supergravity" theories, which will also be studied.
