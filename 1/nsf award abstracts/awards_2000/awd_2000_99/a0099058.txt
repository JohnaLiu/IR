A three-pronged field effort is proposed to study the
              generation, release, and dissipation of tidally generated sidewall eddies in a
              fjord.  The deep (stratified) water adjacent to the headland at which the eddy
              is generated precludes immediate dissipation by bottom friction.  Laboratory
              experiments suggest that the long lifetime of the eddy promotes different
              characteristic flow fields than observed in shallower environments.  This
              hypothesis will be tested.
