Abstract    :
              The researchers will develop and apply new and more efficient
computer
              algorithms for solving problems in quantum field theory
(elementary-particle
              physics) and the statistical mechanics of
phase transitions and critical
              phenomena (condensed-matter physics).
They will then use these numerical
              studies to motivate new theoretical
insights.  The research focuses on two
              principal application areas:
lattice spin models and field theories, including
              lattice gauge theories;
and self-avoiding random walk.

This work impacts
              simultaneously on several areas of physical science
and applied mathematics. 
              Lattice field theories are of direct interest
in elementary-particle physics; 
              in particular, lattice gauge theories
provide our best model for the strong
              subnuclear interaction.
Lattice spin models are employed to model phase
              transitions
in numerous areas of condensed-matter physics and physical
              chemistry.
The self-avoiding walk models the behavior of
              high-molecular-weight
polymer molecules (including proteins and other
              biopolymers) in solution;
it thus has applications in numerous areas of
              physics, chemistry and
chemical engineering, and biophysics.
