Abstract    :
                 This project develops a research proposal investigating how local amenities
              affect manufacturers' location patterns.  This preliminary work can be
              generalized into three tasks:  examination of prior literature, index
              specification, and econometric modeling.  The examination of prior literature
              focuses on multi-market hedonic analysis and location theory.  This information
              will provide a critique of a previously used amenity measure, and will aid in
              expanding and reformulating that measure.  Here also, potential data sources
              will be identified which may be used to achieve that objective.  The third task
              involves identifying econometric models that will be suitable for the proposed
              research being planned.  After these tasks, a competitive grant proposal will
              be submitted in August 2001.  
   Given that amenities do influence location,
              this research is useful to public and private planners interested in economic
              development and forecasting.  More detailed knowledge about the link between
              the two promotes economic efficiency.  The importance of this topic is further
              evidenced by the increased attention paid to amenities and other nontraditional
              location factors when localities compete to attract and retain industry.   Yet
              very little empirical research has been done to date which directly analyzes
              the influence that amenities have on manufacturers' location decisions.
