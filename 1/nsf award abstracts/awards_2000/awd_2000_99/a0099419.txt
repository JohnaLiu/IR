Abstract    :
              It is planned to develop and apply two new next-generation high precision
              many-body formalisms.  One is a generalized cariational coupled-cluster method,
              the other the direct evaluation of fourth-order many-body perturbation theory. 
              They will be tested on high precision experimental data for alkali-metal atoms.
               The approaches will improve the basis for high-precision interpretations of
              parity-nonconservation measurements, constraining extensions to the standard
              model of elementary particles.  They will permit the high precision description
              of long-range interactions, crucial to ultra-cold collision studies.
