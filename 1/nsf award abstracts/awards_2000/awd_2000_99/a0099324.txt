This award supports theoretical research on the dynamics of
              defects in condensed matter systems and their role in  the development of
              ordered phases. Three basic types of systems will be studied: systems
              approaching equilibrium where regions of frustration give rise to defects, such
              as domain walls, vortices, monopoles, and disclinations, which anneal over
              time; systems forming near stationary patterns with defects serving as
              disordering agents; and driven systems where defects are created as part of the
              driving process.  Superfluids, magnets, nematic liquid crystals, and structures
              formed from block copolymers are among specific systems for application.  Aims
              of this proposal include: investigating methods for deriving the equations of
              motion of defects from more microscopic descriptions of spatially varying
              order, determining statistical properties of defect dynamics, and studying
              various aspects of defect dynamics in driven systems.

This award supports
              theoretical research in the dynamics of defects and their role in  the
              development of ordered phases.  Defects are ubiquitous in condensed matter
              systems, for example, vortices in superfluid and normal liquid helium, domain
              walls in magnets and disclinations in liquid crystals, and play an important
              role in determining many properties of materials. An important part of this
              research involves the determination of the equations of motion for defects that
              exist on intermediate length scales from more microscopic equations that
              describe ordered states and their spatial variation.  The proposed research
              will support training graduate students in nonequilibrium statistical
              mechanics.
