Abstract    :
              The restructuring of the utility industry has created new opportunities for
              distributed generation.  The market for distributed generation is growing and
              is expected to reach between 25 to 50 GW by 2010.  Current trends in the United
              States favor distributed generation due to its increased efficiency and reduced
              emissions. 

The objective of the proposed research is to develop a low cost,
              high efficiency interface system in residential buildings for connecting dc
              sources like fuel cells to the grid, and to provide backup power during utility
              outages.  

The proposed topology supplies output power as split single-phase
              (plus/minus 120 V, 240 V).  A novel system configuration is proposed which
              essentially eliminates all switching losses, thus enabling very high efficiency
              and high power density.

A prototype utility interface rated for an output
              power of 1.5 kW operating from a dc input will be built.  The prototype will be
              thoroughly tested for its functionality and efficiency.  The protection
              features incorporated into the system will be tested against possible fault
              conditions.  The design will be scaled up to a 10 kW power rating.

A
              low-cost, high efficiency utility interface (also able to act as a backup power
              source) will accelerate the use of distributed generation sources such as fuel
              cells and micro-turbines.  The design of the proposed interface can be modified
              for higher power in three-phase applications.
