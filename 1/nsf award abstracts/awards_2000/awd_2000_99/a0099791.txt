This award to Oregon State University provides instrumentation
              to significantly improve the oceanographic research capabilities of the
              institution and the research vessel Wecoma, an NSF-owned ship operated by OSU
              as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research
              fleet.  The winch supported here will allow much more efficient use of the
              vessel in surveying, as it allows use of a fiber optic cable system, and
              upgrades existing capabilities so that shallow and deep operations may take
              place during the same, synopic surveys.  The other item, a time domain
              reflectometer (TDR), will allow rapid identification of the location of tow
              cable failures, and thus save time and effort during survey operations when
              cable problems arise.  These improvements will be of substantial advantage to
              marine scientists using the ship in their research during 2001 and future
              years.
