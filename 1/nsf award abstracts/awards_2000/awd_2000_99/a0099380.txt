Abstract    :
              The fundamental theory of elementary particles, quantum chromodynamics, has been
              thoroughly tested both theoretically and experimentally.  It contains quarks,
              the basic constituents of neutrons and protons, and gluons, the particles
              responsible for nuclear forces.  The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at
              Brookhaven National Laboratory, which began operation in June 2000, will
              accelerate and collide two beams of heavy nucleii in order to produce a new
              state of matter known as the quark-gluon plasma.  In this plasma the
              temperature is so high that the quarks and gluons are not confined inside
              nucleii.  The properties of this quark-gluon plasma are a crucial test of
              quantum chromodynamics and are important for understanding the early universe. 
              This project will perform theoretical calculations on the behavior of the
              particles in the quark-gluon plasma.
