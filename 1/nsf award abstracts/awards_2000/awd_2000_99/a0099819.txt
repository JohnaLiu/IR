This is a workshop proposal submitted by Dr. Robert Davis,
              University of Virginia, to request travel expenses to enable 12 U.S. scientists
              to attend an international meeting on new perspectives on catalysis for
              sustainable chemical technologies.  This meeting is scheduled to be held in
              Beijing, China on September 23-27, 2001.  The purpose of this workshop is to
              bring together young scientists and engineers for an exchange of views on
              future trends in catalyst synthesis and catalytic reaction processes related to
              the environment and energy production.  The NSF and the National Science
              Foundation of China jointly support this workshop.
