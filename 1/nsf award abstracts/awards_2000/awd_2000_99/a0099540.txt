Abstract    :
              This award will provide support for several experimental research
activities
              based at Jefferson Laboratory in Newport News, VA.  These
include: (1) a
              measurement of the neutral pion lifetime, which will
provide a quantitative
              test of predictions of quantum
chromodynamics; (2) tests of so-called
              parton-hadron duality in
inelastic electron scattering from the proton; (3)
              electromagnetic
production of strange particles and hypernuclei.  These
              efforts will
involve strong participation by students and
              postdoctoral
researchers from underrepresented groups.
