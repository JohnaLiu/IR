Abstract    :
              This is a continuing project in the combination astronomical and laboratory
              studies of the molecular spectroscopy of simple molecular ions.   A number of
              directions will be pursued.  1)  Astronomical spectroscopy of H3+ and related
              molecules will be continued in order to reveal a more complete picture of the
              chemistry of the diffuse interstellar medium.   2)  A new ion spectrometer
              based on a computer-controlled color center laser will be used for vibration
              rotation spectroscopy of molecular ions of astrophysical interest such as
              C3H3+, CH2NH2+, etc.  3)  The laboratory spectroscopy will be pushed to shorter
              wavelength regions to correspond to a change from astronomical observation in
              dense clouds to diffuse clouds.  Overtones of H3+, a benchmark for theoretical
              studies, will be the first focus of the new measurements.  This
              multi-disciplinary project is supported jointly by the Divisions of Physics,
              Chemistry, and Astronomical Sciences in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences
              Directorates.
