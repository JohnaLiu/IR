Abstract    :
              
The long term objective of this Doctoral Dissertation Research Investigation
              is to better understand how decisions with regards to program design made by
              state level policy makers affect the target populations use of state supported
              health care through Medicaid. Specifically, the research has the following
              goals: First, the research seeks to determine what environmental (health,
              economic, and social) and political factors shape the decisions of states to
              request Medicaid program waivers? Second, why do states vary in their design
              and complexity of managed care programs in Medicaid? Finally, do variations in
              managed care programs affect the delivery of health care? Specifically, does
              the access to care and the cost to state vary by design? To answer these
              questions multiple designs and statistical procedures will be employed. An
              event count approach using the 50 states from 1981 through 1998 provides an
              explanation of the determinants of an increased probability to obtain a waiver.
              To address the issues of program diversity, access, and cost a set of
              simultaneous equation models will be employed. Indices are created to serve
              both as independent and dependent variables. Health Care Financing
              Administration data as well as additional data collected by the Ph.D. student
              will be used in this study.
