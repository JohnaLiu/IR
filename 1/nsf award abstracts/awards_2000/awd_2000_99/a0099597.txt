Abstract    :
              The proposed work addresses a computational model for periodic pattern
              perception based on the mathematical theory of crystallographic groups. The
              model to be built will have a capability of isolating underlying periodic
              patterns in images. Results of the work are likely to enrich methods of image
              processing of symmetric structures. Other applications include pattern indexing
              (textile, psychology), image reproduction/compression, gait analysis, among
              others.
