Abstract    :
              The issue-oriented and eigth grade courses in life and physical science
              developed by SEPUP (Science Education for Public Understanding Program) are
              extended to the sixth grade covering Physics and Earth Science.  Students will
              understand the unique physical characteristics of the Earth in comparison with
              other planets, the relationship between force and motion, the role gravity
              plays in planetary processes, how energy in sunlight interacts with the Earth
              and its atmosphere, the role convection plays in atmospheric, oceanic and
              geologic processes and how the study of rocks provides evidence of current and
              past Earth processes and conditions.  Each of these topics is considered in the
              context of making informed, non-emotional, evidence-based decisions that affect
              students and their families such as global warming, need for space exploration,
              location of essential, but potentionally dangerous structures, etc.  The course
              materials include kits, printed materials, teacher guides and community
              outreach tools.  The materials are developed by teachers and scientists and are
              tested in classrooms.  Specific learning goals for students are derived from
              national and state standards.  Student assessment is based on the previously
              developed embedded assessment system.  The materials are published and
              distributed by LabAids.
