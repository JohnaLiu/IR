Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for a group at the College of William and Mary to
              participate in the MECO experiment currently being planned to run at Brookhaven
              National Laboratory.  The MECO experiment, testing lepton-flavor violation
              scenarios beyond the Standard Model, will be sensitive to direct
              muon-to-electron conversion at a branching ratio below 10-16, four orders of
              magnitude more sensitive than previously achieved.
The William and Mary group
              is specifically responsible for the design, fabrication, testing, and
              installation of an active cosmic-ray shield that is to surround the detector
              solenoid.  A double layer scintillator veto shield assures that cosmic-ray
              induced background events which may imitate true muon-to-electron conversion
              events are kept at levels well below the projected sensitivity of the
              experiment.  Both during the R&D phase and the assembly phase many
              opportunities will develop for engaging the research talents of postdocs,
              graduate students and undergraduates who will work professionally towards a
              rewarding and challenging scientific objective while learning important skills
              and techniques.
