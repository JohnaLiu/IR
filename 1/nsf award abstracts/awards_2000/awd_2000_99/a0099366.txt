Abstract    :
              	The geometry of a separable infinite dimensional Banach space
X can be studied
              and better understood through a study of its spreading
models and  asymptotic
              structure (those finite dimensional bases that
can be found inside X, but
              arbitrarily spread out).  Knowledge of these
structures does not always pass
              through to infinite dimensional information
about X but sometimes,
              surprisingly, it does.  The author will study a
number of open problems of
              this nature using the tools of infinite
combinatorics, analysis and logic. For
              example if a Banach space has only
one spreading model, must it contain a copy
              of one of the classical Banach
spaces?

	This project concerns the study of
              the geometry of normed linear
spaces.  The easiest example of such a space is
              ordinary three dimensional
Euclidean space.  However one may, even in two or
              three dimensions, have
other geometries than Euclidean.  For example in the
              "taxicab" space
distances between points in the plane are computed by
              traveling the
shortest route along roads that run only horizontally or
              vertically.  In
this geometry the set of all points equidistant from a fixed
              point is
diamond shaped rather than a circle.  Applications of such
              alternate
geometries are numerous in physics, engineering, signal processing
              and
many other sciences. The state of a system or a signal may be given by
              a
sequence of numbers and one may have to have a way of computing
              the
distance between two states or signals to see how close they are. And
              in
these applications one has to often use finite dimensional spaces
              of
larger dimension than three or even spaces of infinite dimension. 
              The
author will be exploring the latter  case by studying the 
"asymptotic"
              structures of these alternate geometries. This is a method of
linking finite
              and infinite dimensional structure.  The techniques to be 
used are a
              combination of analysis, infinitary combinatorics and
logic.  The problems
              that arise could also impact and motivate development
in these latter areas as
              well.
