A field experiment is proposed, which will provide
              multi-year time series of salt, heat, and mass transports from the Agulhas
              retroflection region into the South Atlantic subtropical gyre.  The program
              will deploy inverted echo sounders, both with and without pressure sensors and
              near-bottom current meters. The in situ data will be complemented with
              satellite data, both SST and altimetry.  Historical data will also be included
              in the data analysis.  The success of the program is based substantially on a
              new technique, GEM-ETTA, for analyzing IES (inverted echo sounder) and PIES
              (pressure and inverted echo sounder) data.  Analysis of the field data in
              conjunction with reanalysis of historical data will provide the first long-term
              time series of these inter-basin fluxes on interannual scales.
