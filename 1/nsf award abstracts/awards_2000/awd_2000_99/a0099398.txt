Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to gain an increased understanding of the
              behavior of simple quantal systems whose classical counterparts are chaotic. 
              This will be done by carrying out different sets of experiments in close
              concert with collaborating theorists.   One experiment will study the response
              of hydrogen atoms in highly excited states to strong, non-perturbative external
              fields that are near or above the threshold for ionization.  A second will use
              the polarization of the driving field to test theoretical predictions about the
              dimensionality dependence of different strong-field phenomena.
