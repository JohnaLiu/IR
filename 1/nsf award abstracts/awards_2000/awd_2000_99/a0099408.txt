Abstract    :
              The principal investigator and his colleagues study noncommutative algebra
and
              associated noncommutative geometry. The proposal consists of two topics:
the
              classification of graded domains of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension three,
or the
              classification of noncommutative projective surfaces; applications
of
              dualizing complexes. The classification question is one of the most
important
              questions in noncommutative algebra and noncommutative projective
geometry.
              Derived categories has been used in many areas of mathematics,
and it has been
              proven that the dualizing complex is an effective tool in
studying
              noncommutative rings. More applications of dualizing complexes are
expected to
              be discovered.

Noncommutative algebra plays an important role in Mathematics
              and Physics.
For example, quantum groups introduced in the 1980's are
              essentially a family
of noncommutative and noncocommutative Hopf algebras.
              Some classes of
subtle symmetries appeared in Mathematics and Physics can be
              expressed by
using noncommutativity. The aim of this proposal is to develop
              effective
methods, to understand the structure of noncommutative algebra, and
              to
explore its interaction with other field such as statistical
              mechanics,
quantum field theory, and noncommutative geometry.
