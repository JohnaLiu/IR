Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for the 12th International Workshop on Plant
              Membrane Biology to be held at the University of Wisconsin, Madison WI, August
              11-16, 2001. This meeting, the most prestigious in the field, is held somewhere
              in the world every three years. The aim is to provide an opportunity for
              researchers to exchange the most recent information and ideas relating to the
              biology of plant membranes, a field that is rapidly advancing through the
              application of biophysics, cell biology, genetics, and genomics. The conference
              will address topics such as Hormone Responses, Environmental Signal Perception,
              Nutrient Acquisition, Membranes and Development, Source/Sink Transport, Water
              Relations, Comparative Genomics, Evolution of Transporters, Structure/Function
              Relationships, and Practical Applications of Membrane Research. Oral and poster
              presentations will be thematically grouped and sessions will include a
              representative mixture of experimental and intellectual approaches to important
              topics in plant membrane biology. Talks will be either 30 min or 15 min. Some
              speakers will be invited in advance and some will be selected from the
              submitted abstracts. Participation of relatively young PIs, postdoctoral
              fellows, and graduate students is a goal to be achieved through their special
              consideration for financial support and invitations to speak. Based on
              experience, we expect approximately 450 participants.
