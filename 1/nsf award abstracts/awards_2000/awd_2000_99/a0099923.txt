Abstract    :
              This proposal is for research into three areas of current interest
              in
noncommutative algebra.  First the PI plans to study the
              enveloping
algebra of a classical simple Lie superalgebra.  Specifically he
              is
interested in primitive ideals and problems concerning the center of
              the
enveloping algebra.  Secondly the PI intends to investigate
              differential
operators on toric varieties and maps between toric varieties
              arising from
refinements of fans.  Finally the PI proposes the study of
              certain finite
dimensional Hopf algebras arising from quantized enveloping
              algebras of
classical Lie superalgebras.  The methods to be used come
              from
representation theory and algebraic geometry.

This research is
              concerned with some particular aspects of modern
abstract algebra, as an area
              of mathematics.
In recent years a number of algebraic constructions have been
              increasingly
important in Physics.  These include Lie superalgebras and
              quantum groups,
two constructions which will be investigated in this proposal.
               It is a
widely held belief that a better understanding of the algebraic
              structure
of these objects could lead to further significant advances in
              Physics.
