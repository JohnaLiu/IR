Abstract    :
              It is intended to extend present understanding of how to achieve overlap of
              oppositely signed plasma species within nested Penning traps.  (Penning traps
              are a plasma confinement approach which employs an applied electric field to
              provide charged particle confinement along an applied magnetic field.)  The
              emphasis is on how to overlap positron and antiproton plasmas so that
              recombination takes place and trapping of antihydrogen atoms is possible.
