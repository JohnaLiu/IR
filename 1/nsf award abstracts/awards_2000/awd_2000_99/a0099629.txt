	This study will investigate the toughening of highly
              cross-linked thermosetting polymers by the incorporation of various
              nanoparticles. A direct fabrication technique will be used to independently
              control the reinforcement geometry (size, size distribution and morphology),
              reinforcement material, reinforcement volume fraction, and interfacial adhesion
              characteristics. The effects of these reinforcement parameters, on the fracture
              mechanisms, fracture toughness and material response, will be characterized by
              direct experimentation. Based on this fundamental characterization
              analytical/numerical models will be developed to predict the overall material
              response and toughness. 
	The education component of this investigation is
              targeted towards increased integration between undergraduate education and
              research with special emphasis on increasing the participation of
              underrepresented minorities in engineering. Undergraduate students will be
              recruited to work on various tasks relevant to the research component. At the
              same time, specific research findings and projects will be introduced into
              undergraduate courses that focus on the behavior of materials. Also, students
              will make periodic visits to local high schools and setup in-house laboratory
              demonstrations.  These activities will expose high school students to the
              excitement and challenges of innovative materials based on cutting-edge
              nanotechnology. Finally, results from the education and research activities
              will be published regularly on a dedicated web page, which will enable
              concurrent feedback and interaction unlike traditional paper-based
              publication.
