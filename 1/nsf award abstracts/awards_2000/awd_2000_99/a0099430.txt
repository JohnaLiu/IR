Abstract    :
              The effect of membrane behavior in clay soils is to reduce the contaminant mass
              flux through the soil relative to the contaminant mass flux that would occur in
              the absence of membrane behavior. Since the purpose of many clay soil barriers
              used in waste containment and in situ remediation applications is to restrict
              the migration of aqueous miscible contaminants, the existence of membrane
              behavior represents a potentially significant beneficial aspect that presently
              is not considered in the use of clay soil barriers for such applications. Thus,
              the goal of the research is to evaluate the significance of membrane behavior
              of engineered clay soil barrier materials with respect to their use in waste
              containment and in situ remediation applications. This goal will be achieved by
              providing sufficient experimental data to evaluate the combined effects of
              compressibility and salt concentration on the membrane behavior of clay soils
              that have properties resembling those of barrier materials used in waste
              containment and in situ remediation applications. The proposed research will
              advance our present understanding of membrane behavior sufficiently to allow a
              more rational basis for potentially incorporating membrane behavior into the
              design of clay soil barriers, such as compacted clay liners, geosynthetic clay
              liners, and soil-bentonite vertical cutoff walls.
