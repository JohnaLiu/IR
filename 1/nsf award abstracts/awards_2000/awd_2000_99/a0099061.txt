Abstract    :
              Summary:  This objective of this study is to provide estimates of long-term
              changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations from the Eocene through
              the Oligocene.  The study will utilize carbon isotope measurement of alkenones
              and carbonate microfossils along with oxygen isotope measurements in carbonate
              microfossils.  Measurements will be done on 6 discreet time slices representing
              the early, middle, and late Eocene and the early, middle and late Oligocene. 
              Sample resolution will be approximately 250 to 500ky.  In addition records will
              be established prior to and following distinct climatic episodes such as the
              Eocene/Oligocene transition and the apparent rapid deglaciation at the end of
              the Oligocene.
