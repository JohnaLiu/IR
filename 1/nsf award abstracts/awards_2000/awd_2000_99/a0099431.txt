Classical intuition plays a crucial role in the analysis of a
              wide variety of complex quantum mechanical phenomena. The proposed research
              continues the PI's work in extending this intuition to include nonlinear
              systems exhibiting chaotic dynamics. In particular, the study would emphasize
              the use of classical analyses to facilitate control of the corresponding
              quantum dynamics. The research is largely motivated by recent experimental
              realizations of mesoscale phenomena, particularly in the contexts of cold atom
              optics and nanostructures.
