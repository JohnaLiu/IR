Abstract    :
              0099059/Schopf

This project focuses on the development and testing of a
              numerical 
ocean general circulation model, including its application to dense
              
overflows and the deep circulation of the ocean.  If successful, the
              
primary outcomes will be an enhancement of infrastructure, in the form 
of
              better ocean modeling capability, and better insight into the 
dynamics of
              dense overflows.  The ocean model at the heart of the 
project is the Poseidon
              model which uses a generalized vertical 
coordinate.  The model development
              will center on improving the 
representation of ocean mixing, using existing
              observational data and 
theoretical results on dense overflows, such as the
              Mediterranean 
outflow, to define test problems and calibrate the results.  
              The 
project will also explore the effectiveness of several other
              
algorithmic refinements.
