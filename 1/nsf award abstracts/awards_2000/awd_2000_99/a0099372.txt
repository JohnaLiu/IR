Abstract    :
              Three topics in Rydberg electron dynamics in external fields will be studied:
              (1) spatial localization of atomic electrons, (2) ionization of Rydberg states
              in rotating microwave fields, and (3) chaotic scattering of Rydberg electrons. 
              Both classical and quantum approaches will be used.  Results achieved in
              problems involving Coriolis forces, where reduced dimensionality models fail
              due to unconserved angular momentum, will be utilized.
