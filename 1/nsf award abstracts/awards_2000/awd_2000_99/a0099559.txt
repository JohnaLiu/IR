Abstract    :
              This proposal addresses research in LIGO data analysis leading to gravitational
              wave astronomy.  In particular, methods for removing instrumental noise from
              the LIGO data stream, preparatory to its analysis will be developed.  This
              work, called "data conditioning", is critical to the success of the LIGO since
              the gravitational wave signals are expected to be weak and would most likely be
              totally masked by instrumental noise.  Several methods are proposed for
              conditioning LIGO data including the use of "artificial intelligence" tools for
              time-ordered data.  In addition, LIGO data will be analysed to 
1. set upper
              limits on the gravitational wave strength from known pulsars,
2. search for
              unanticipated sources of gravitational waves,
3. combine data from the three
              LIGO detectors synthesized to perform as a single detector.
On technique for
              identifying gravitational wave signals in the data stream invloves the use of
              filters designed to pick out a signal with specific characteristics.  Several
              innovative methods are proposed for the development of non-linear filters in
              the presence of non-Gaussian noise, involving the use of techniques to
              determine the most appropriate likelihood function for use when non-normal
              moments of the data distribution are known.
