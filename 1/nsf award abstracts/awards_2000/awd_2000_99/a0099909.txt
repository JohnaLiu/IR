Abstract    :
              MECHANICS OF SINGLE- AND MULTI-WALL CARBON NANOTUBES

Abstract


Carbon
              nanotubes exhibit superior mechanical properties with extraordinarily
high
              stiffness and strength.  There are, however, virtually no continuum
studies of
              carbon nanotubes because it is generally thought that continuum
mechanics
              theories are not applicable on the atomic or nanometer scales, and
one must
              rely on atomistic studies.  The atomistic studies, on the other
hand, have
              some limitations on both the time and length scales for
applications involving
              a large number of carbon nanotubes.The objective of the 
work is to develop a
              continuum theory for carbon nanotubes that incorporates 
the interatomic
              potential of carbon.  We will adopt a systematic approach to 
link the
              continuum and atomistic scales. The strain energy density on the 
continuum
              level will be obtained by averaging the bond energy in carbon 
bonds on the
              atomic level, which will lead to a continuum constitutive model 
for carbon
              nanotubes.  The nanoscale continuum will then be validated by 
the atomistic
              studies.
