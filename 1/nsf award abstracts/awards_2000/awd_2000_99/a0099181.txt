Abstract    :
              BSCS is developing a 10th-grade curriculum unit on evolution and on science as a
              way of knowing.  Included is a 100-page, six-chapter book to be used by
              students and a teacher's guide that contains background information,
              implementation strategies and student assessments.  The first chapter of the
              student book deals with the nature of science and the issue of diversity and
              unity within and between species, the second with historical materials
              regarding evolutionary theory, the third with basic questions about diversity
              and adaptation, the fourth with genetics and molecular biology, the fifth with
              how evolution can be demonstrated experimentally with viruses and by reference
              to the AIDS epidemic and antibiotic resistance, and the sixth with the effects
              of humans on the environment and on natural selection.  Two CD-ROMs complement
              the program.  One includes samples of the writings of Darwin, maps of his
              voyages, and other historical materials as well as 2-3 student investigations
              for each chapter of the book.  The second CD-ROM is an interactive simulated
              inquiry based on contemporary research on finches in the Galapagos Islands. 
              Also included on the CD-ROMs are professional development materials for
              teachers.
