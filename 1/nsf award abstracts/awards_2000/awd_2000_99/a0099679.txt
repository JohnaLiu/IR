Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for the purchase of a research grade microscope with
              epifluorescence and Nomarski DIC capabilities and of an integrated image
              analysis system to enhance the existing research facilities in the Department
              of Biology at the Humanco campus of the University of Puerto Rico. The
              integrated image analysis system will consist of a high resolution CCD camera,
              video CCD camera, controller/computer, image analysis software and printer. The
              instrumentation will significantly improve research capabilities in microbial
              ecology and neurobiology, and facilitate study of DNA damage by radiation and
              pollution in the environment.  The equipment will enable undergraduate research
              students to participate in collaborative projects with faculty, and to be
              trained in use of techniques that take advantage of recent progress in light
              microscopy, and related improvements in image collection and analysis.
