Abstract    :
              Prliminary paleomagnetic results from ODP cores from Leg 145 show their
              suitability for study of the magnetic paleointensity.  They span the same
              interval of time covered by deep-tow magnetometer survey near Juan de Fuca
              ridge that shows high-frequency wriggles within magnetic anomaly 5 (ca. 10 to
              15 Ma).  These wiggles are either due to high-frequency magnetic field
              reversals or variations in the Earth's magnetic field intensity.  Funds
              provided will allow the study of  these cores in detail and resolve the origin
              of the tiny wriggles.
