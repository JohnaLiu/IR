Abstract    :
              The proposer will work on Operator Theory problems,
problems related to
              invariant subspaces and to
stability. The proposer has developed a new
              technique
to construct invariant subspaces by using different
kinds of
              extremal vectors. This has, so far, led to
new and unified constructions of
              invariant subspaces 
for large classes of operators, including
              operators
commuting with compact or normal operators. It has 
also led to
              strengthenings of so called Two Sequences
Theorems, which are connected to
              invariant subspaces.
There are several directions to refine and improve
              this
techniques and the proposer intends to do so. 
The study of stability
              under perturbations of cyclicity,
supercyclicity or hypercyclicity is still in
              its
beginning, both for operators and vectors. This is
strongly connected to
              the study of which properties are
carried by large resp. small classes of
              operators. The
proposer intends to carry these studies further.

The study
              of operators and their invariant subspaces can
be seen as a generalization of
              linear algebra, where 
matrices and their eigenvectors are studied.
              Although
these are problems in "pure" mathematics, they are
closely connected
              to the many applications of linear
algebra to Physics, Biology, Genetics,
              Economics and other 
sciences as well as to the applications in industry.
              
Operators can be seen as infinite matrices and are a suitable
tool for the
              study of large and complex systems depending on an
unbounded number of
              parameters.
