Abstract    :
              Experimental and theoretical studies on enhancing nonlinear optical processes at
              very low light (single-photon) levels in multi-level atomic systems with and
              without an optical cavity form the focus of this activity.   The main
              objectives of the project include (i) understanding the nonlinear interactions
              between electromagnetic fields and multi-level atomic systems at low light
              level, especially the quantum correlation and quantum statistical properties in
              such systems; (ii) linking the fundamental researches of atomic coherence and
              quantum interference in multi-level systems to practical device applications in
              optical communication;  and (iii) demonstrating a practical opto-electronic
              device concept in semiconductor nanostructures based on quantum interference
              effects in multi-state systems.
