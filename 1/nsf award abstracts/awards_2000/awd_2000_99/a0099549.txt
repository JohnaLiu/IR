Dear Dr.
              Pang,

I enclose here the abstract for my proposal.
Let me know , please, if
              it's O.K.
Sincerely,

Research is proposed on various aspects of the modern theory
              
of financial markets and related mathematical  problems of 
stochastic
              analysis, filtering and control.  Issues that will 
be studied involve:
(i)
              finding algorithms to compute the diffusion term of
the optimal wealth/hedging
              process, and related questions
about Martingale Representation Property and
              Malliavin
Calculus;
(ii) questions on maximizing  Stochastic
              Differential
Utility and connections to Forward-Backward Stochastic
              
Differential Equations and problems of 
incomplete/asymmetric
              information;
(iii)  analytical and numerical methods for finding
              optimal
portfolio/consumption investment for retirement, in general
              
diffusion models;
(iv) theory of utility maximization/risk minimization
              in
general semimartingale models of markets with frictions;
(v) filtering and
              calibration of stochastic volatility models;
(vi) optimal design of executive
              compensation.
It is expected that tools from stochastic analysis and
              martingale
theory, convex duality theory, functional analysis, stochastic
              
control, Monte Carlo/simulation methods, will prove valuable 
in the
              resolution of  these questions, sometimes requiring 
development of new tools,
              thus enhancing the understanding of 
both the theoretical and applied aspects
              of these fields.


The optimal portfolio selection and  consumption
              selection 
is the theory that provides answers to the question of how 
to
              allocate money between investing in different assets in 
financial markets,
              and consuming it in order to buy various goods.  
The theory has been
              developed in almost full generality by now. 
However, it depends on a
              mathematical model of the markets, 
and our ability to estimate the model
              parameters.  For example, 
correct pricing of complex financial contracts,
              such as exotic 
options, depends on how well we can estimate the "volatility"
              
(riskiness) of the stock on which the option is written.
One of the problems
              we propose to study is how to do this 
estimation by using observed stock
              prices.  Similarly, the 
problem of actually  computing the corresponding 
              optimal 
trading strategies has not been resolved in general.  The
              
algorithms that are commonly used today typically do not work well
in more
              complex and realistic models for financial markets, that 
are becoming a
              standard, due to the increased sophistication of 
market modelers.  Thus, it
              is important to explore new analytical 
and computational methods for finding
              optimal trading strategies, 
some of which are suggested in this proposal. 
              Similar methods are 
suggested for exploring important problem of how a firm
              should  
compensate its executive so that the resulting behavior of the
              
executive is optimal.
