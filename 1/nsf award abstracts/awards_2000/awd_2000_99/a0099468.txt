Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on possible
              
extra dimensions of space, their role in the fundamental laws of nature and
              
in cosmology. The research will develop specific models which utilize
              
extra-dimensional mechanisms for resolving several outstanding puzzles in the
              
standard model of particle physics, and study their experimental
              implications. 
Extra spatial dimensions are strongly motivated by Superstring
              Theory, the 
best developed theory for unifying General Relativity with
              Quantum Mechanics. 
The experimental discovery of new dimensions would
              revolutionize our 
understanding of fundamental physics and initiate an
              exciting new frontier of 
exploration. For these reasons, the research is of
              the highest importance in 
our quest for a fundamental understanding of the
              physical universe.
