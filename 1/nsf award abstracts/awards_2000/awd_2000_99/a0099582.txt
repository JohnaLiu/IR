Abstract    :
              This research program focuses on quantum control of atomic motion in optical
              lattices, extended arrays of micron-sized traps formed by the AC Stark shift in
              laser standing waves.  Research will concentrate on two related problems:  (1)
              the study of quantum dynamics and the quantum to classical transition for
              atomic spinor wavepackets in magneto-optical double wells and (II) quantum
              feedback control in this same system, with the objective of creating specific
              quantum states or enforcing a desired quantum evolution.
