Abstract    :
              This project provides for continued operation of the armored T-28 meteorological
              research aircraft system as a national facility for research into cloud,
              thunderstorm and hailstorm processes.  The proposed cooperative agreement
              provides for the management, staffing, upgrading, testing, operation, and
              maintenance of the T-28 aircraft and associated instrumentation and software. 
              These efforts will maintain the performance and measurement capabilities of the
              aircraft and make it available for support of several upcoming research
              projects requiring observations within the around mature covective storms.  The
              focus of these investigations is on thunderstorm electrification and its
              relation to Nox production, and on validating and improving
              hydrometeor-identification algorithms for polarimetric radars.  The proposed
              agreement includes scientific effort to support facility deployments and
              analysis of the resulting data engineering effort to evaluate modifications to
              improve aircraft performance, and instrumentation and software upgrades to
              enhance the scientific and educational capabilities of the facility.
