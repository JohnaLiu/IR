The problem being addressed in this proposal,
              dissolution mechanisms in deep sea carbonate sediments, is essential to the
              interpretation of paleo-climate records and to provide a robust assessment of
              the role of the carbonate pump in the global carbon cycle.  The approach
              suggested here is an extension of the PI's previous NSF award investigating
              non-homogeneous carbonate dissolution.  Since the rain-rates of  CaCO3 and
              230Th to sediments should remain constant over time, variations in the 230 Th
              normalized accumulation rate of CaCO3 should provide a sensitive and
              independent indicator of any variable CaCO3 dissolution.. The PI proposes to
              use this at a number of selected and well-characterized sites (e.g. Ontong-Java
              Plateau in western Eq..Pac; Ceara Rise in west. Eq. Atl; Sierra Leone Rise and
              Cape Verde Plateau in east. Eq. Atl.) which he has sampled during the past
              decade. Correlation of the high spatial resolution (2 -3mm) 230Th  analyses
              with those factors thought to control CaCO3 dissolution (such as sediment
              composition, sediment mixing rates, pore water chemistry, pH, dissolved oxygen
              and organic carbon etc) will be undertaken for these sediment cores.
              Radiocarbon (14C) ages of calcite dissolving at the sea floor provides a
              centennial to millennial timescale with which to observe and interpret more
              complex mixing models for carbonate dissolution occurring in the deep sea
              sedimentary record. The interpretation of past climatic change through studying
              carbonate sediment accumulation in the  deep ocean is recognized as being an
              important component of climate change research.
