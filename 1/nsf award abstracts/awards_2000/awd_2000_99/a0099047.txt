Abstract    :
              This "proof-of-concept" project will develop a cognition-based assessment system
              (CBAS) to help determine the cognitive underpinnings students reach in
              understanding and mastering core mathematical ideas in grades K-8.  The project
              will identify these ideas in the areas of geometry and whole numbers.  The
              system is comprised of  a) the identification of core mathematical concepts in
              K-8;  b) research-based cognitive milestones and fluencies for each core
              concept; and  c) assessment tasks that track different positions of student
              understanding as students progress.  CBAS will be designed for use by teachers
              in formative and summative classroom assessment, and for use by districts,
              program evaluators and researchers in evaluating the quality of student
              learning in various curricular and instructional programs.
