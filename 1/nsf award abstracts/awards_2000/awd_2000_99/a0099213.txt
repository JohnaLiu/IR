Abstract    :
              The "Journey to El Yunque" is a website to improve middle school students'
              understanding of ecology and changing ecosystems.  The bilingual web-based
              learning environment allows students to investigate the effects of Hurricane
              Georges on the Caribbean National Forest known as El Yunque.  The materials
              address selected science standards.  Embedded assessments are included. 
              Teacher support materials are connected to the "Exploring the Environment"
              website hosted by NASA.  Parent support pages are provided
