This project requests travel support for 24
              participants from U.S. universities in the Student Paper Competition at the
              2001 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium (IMS).  The IMS is the annual
              meeting of the Microwave Theory and Techniques Society (MTT-S) of the Institute
              of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. (IEEE).  The IMS is also the
              major international symposium in the microwave field and a focus of research
              results in wireless telecommunications.  The 2001 IMS will be held in Phoenix,
              AZ, USA on May 20-25, 2001.

Each year, the Microwave Theory and Techniques
              Society promotes student education in microwave theory and techniques through a
              number of mechanisms.  One of the most important is the Student Paper
              Competition at the IMS.  This selective program brings the world's best
              students together in an integrated program in which they present their work not
              only to a technical audience but again to a group of judges.  The program helps
              develop the students' technical acumen as well as their communication and
              presentation skills.  It also helps introduce them to the international
              technical community and helps to build a community of students who will lead
              the next generation of microwave engineers.

The IMS provides financial
              support of various forms but does not reimburse travel expenses.  Travel
              support from NSF will ensure that the program is open to the widest range of
              interested applicants from U.S. universities.
