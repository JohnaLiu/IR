Abstract    :
              The broad objective of this interdisciplinary research project is to develop the
              fundamental knowledge required to reliably manufacture functional
              ceramic-polymer composites for ultrasonic sensor applications. 
A new approach
              for designing and rapidly screening functional materials referred to as
              combinatorial engineering has been developed.  This approach involves producing
              mesoscale periodic structures with both composition and design variations.  Its
              success hinges critically on exploiting recent advances in solid freeform (or
              additive) fabrication of materials, such as robotically controlled deposition
              (RCD) that offer the agility required to rapidly build complex 3D components. 
              The RCD process utilizes concentrated colloidal gels (as inks) during the
              deposition process.  The aim is to build and test the piezoelectric response of
              composites containing interpenetrating ceramic-polymer matrices connected in
              three dimensions.   

These components may find application as ultrasonic
              sensors in advanced medical imaging devices.  Moreover, such architectures may
              find broad application as photonic lattices, substrates for catalyst supports,
              and scaffolds for biomaterials.  Outreach to high school science teachers and
              their students will continue to be a focus of the research.  The current web
              site created by this research team to introduce materials science and
              engineering to a broader audience will be augmented with a demonstration based
              on robotically controlled deposition processing.  The research team will also
              include hands-on experiences for undergraduate students brought into the lab
              environment.
