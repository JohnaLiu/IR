Abstract    :
              
This is a proposal to continue the research supported by NSF Grant ECS 9725148
              along two direc-tions.

Computation of the reach sets of hybrid dynamical
              systems is needed to evaluate system perfor-mance. Prior work led to efficient
              algorithms for calculating the reach sets of linear systems with bounded
              control, with and without uncertainty. Those algorithms will be extended to
              hybrid sys-tems. Lambda-Shift is a new language for the specification and
              simulation of hierarchical, hybrid systems. It has the potential of providing
              an invaluable framework for the design of such systems. That potential will be
              explored.

The proposed research leverages efforts supported by the DARPA
              Program on Model Based Inte-gration of Embedded Software (MoBJES), and the ONR
              Program on Autonomous Vehicles.
