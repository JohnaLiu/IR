Funding is provided to complete the analysis of the
              comprehensive data set collected over the last data decade by the ARLINOD
              project in the Indonesian Seas. An array of CTD stations, with a lowered
              Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler in 1998, was sampled from 1991 to 1998 within
              the deep Indonesian Seas, east of Kalimantan, and moored current meter and
              temperature measurements were collected in the Makassar Straits from December
              1996 to July 1998. A comprehensive treatment of these data in conjunction with
              archived XBT data will be conducted to investigate various circulation and
              stratification characteristics with the Indonesian Seas pertaining to the
              Indonesian Throughflow and its monsoon and ENSO modulations. The central theme
              of the research is to place the Indonesian Seas into the context of larger
              scale climate phenomena and inter-ocean exchange. The specific objectives are
              to investigate: (1) spatial and temporal variability of the ocean
              stratification (surface, thermocline and deeper water) within the Indonesian
              Seas, and (2) the relationship of Makassar Strait mass and thermohaline fluxes
              to regional and larger scale stratification characteristics.
