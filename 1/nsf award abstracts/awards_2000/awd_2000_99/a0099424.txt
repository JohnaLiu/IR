Abstract    :
              The Association of American Universities (AAU) is developing an
              inter-institutional network of AAU institutions to sustain current exemplary
              practices in the mathematics, science and technology preparation of teachers
              and to promote the sharing of such practices in teacher preparation. AAU is
              convening a forum for vertical teams from AAU universities consisting of
              college and university administrators, including Deans of Science and Deans of
              Education, and science, mathematics, engineering, and education faculty. This
              invitational forum on Exemplary Practices and Challenges in Teacher
              Preparation, features presentations of models of teacher preparation in
              mathematics, science, and technology, discussions of implementation strategies,
              and a webcast of the conference. Outcomes of the forum include publication of
              the conference proceedings, identification of best practices, and the
              development of a Campus Action Plan to guide campuses in developing their
              individual implementation plans for engaging science, mathematics, and
              engineering faculty in teacher education. The forum reflects the goals of a
              1999 Resolution on Teacher Education adopted by the presidents and chancellors
              of AAU calling for an increased effort to certify disciplinary majors to teach,
              an ongoing commitment to integrate the research activities of universities with
              preservice and continuing teacher education, and a renewed emphasis on the
              importance of engaging the university faculty more fully in their roles of
              preparing future teachers, experienced teachers, and future teachers of
              teachers. AAU seeks to create a network of faculty and leaders in research
              universities who share, develop, and adopt exemplary practices in teacher
              education.
