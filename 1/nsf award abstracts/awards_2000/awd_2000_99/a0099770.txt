Abstract    :
              The proposed work addresses development of novel methods for enhancing the
              ability of humans to perform complex and delicate manipulation tasks at a
              microscopic level. The proposed approach is based on a combination of off-line
              programming and on-line adaptation of task-specific human-computer manipulation
              idioms. The work builds upon this group's experience in the development of
              steady-hand robotic augmentation. Specific tasks from microsurgery and
              micro-assembly will be used for testing the ideas and evaluating the results
              obtained.
