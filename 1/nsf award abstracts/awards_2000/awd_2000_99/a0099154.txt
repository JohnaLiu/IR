Abstract    :
              The northern boundary of the Galapagos microplate is defined by a relatively
              recent "Incipient Rift" that is a slow-spreading new rift oriented orthogonal 
              (along a flowline) to the active East Pacific Rise (EPR). The PIs propose to
              map this incipient rift completely with multibeam, to conduct basalt sampling
              by wax coring and dredging, and to run some towed camera traverses within the
              rift. Based on samples from a pilot study, the incipient rift offers the
              opportunity to sample the behavior of the EPR melting regime in the across-axis
              dimension and to examine changes in the amount of melting that takes place as
              one moves farther from the active EPR axis. The mapping and camera work will
              help to locate good sampling sites and will also help to determine whether the
              800m scarps of the incipient rift expose deeper rocks, potentially a useful
              complement to studies of Hess Deep and the nature of young crust formed at the
              EPR. The proposed study would be carried out on a large UNOLS vessel ( 23 days
              of Melville requested), with subsequent laboratory study of samples, and
              laboratory study of camera and multibeam results.
