Abstract    :
              The goal of this proposed study is to obtain data on the partitioning of rare
              earth elements (REE) between minerals and aqueous fluids under conditions like
              those existing in active hydrothermal systems. This will allow a more
              quantitative evaluation of hypotheses regarding mineral reactions in the
              so-called "reaction zone" of active systems. With a variety of starting
              materials and conditions, the experiments will help understand  REE
              partitioning during alteration of plagioclase and clinopyroxene, the main REE-
              carrying minerals in basalt and diabase. In addition, experiments will be done
              to evaluate the effect of anhydrite and barite precipitation on the REE
              patterns of hydrothermal fluids. This study will specifically test the
              hypothesis that the REE patterns of hydrothermal fluids are due mostly to the
              alteration of plagioclase.
