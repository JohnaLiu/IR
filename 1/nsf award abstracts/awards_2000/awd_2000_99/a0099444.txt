Phenomenological nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials, based on
              meson exchange, provide a high-precision description of the NN scattering data.
               A drawback of these potentials is that they are not derived from the
              fundamental theory of the strong interaction, QCD.  The symmetries of QCD are
              retained in a low energy effective field theory termed chiral perturbation
              theory.  The chiral NN potentials so derived do not, as yet, provide such a
              quantitative fit, nor are they suited for microscopic nuclear structure theory.
              The Principal Investigator has experience with the development of potentials
              that provide a high quality fit.  The proposal contains a plan for continuing
              development of the chiral NN potentials until they give a high-precision fit to
              the data.  An accurate chiral NN potential will have substantial impact on
              exact few-nucleon studies and microscopic nuclear many-body theory.
