ABSTRACT CMS0099638 "Performance of
              Electric Utility Lifelines in Urban Centers for Earthquake Hazards" PI: Dorothy
              Reed, University of Washington. 

The utility infrastructure system in the US
              is undergoing significant changes due to deregulation. Recently, structural
              component failures induced by natural hazards previously considered minor have
              caused widespread blackouts. The effects of shortages due to natural and
              man-made causes has been particularly critical for the Pacific Northwest, as
              compliance with environmental standards places constraints on the generation of
              power.  It has become clear that the US lacks a cohesive approach to electric
              utility infrastructure reliability.  Such a framework would be valuable in
              identifying the importance of system components and ultimately provide
              guidelines for improved performance. 

We propose to develop a
              reliability-based framework for the performance assessment of power delivery by
              an electric utility distribution system for earthquake hazards. The
              distribution system is defined to include components such as the distribution
              lines, poles, pole-based equipment and substations. Our framework will be
              focused on the performance of the structural system used to deliver power and
              its interactions with other critical lifelines.  Our approach will
              significantly expand the three-pronged model developed by Nojima of Gifu
              University in Japan in which component, system and societal performance
              measures are blended into a single standard. The valuable lessons learned
              through the Hyogoken-Nanbu (Kobe) and Nisqually earthquakes will also be
              incorporated into our investigation. This investigation will require the
              formulation of proposed performance levels in the context of the present US
              socio-economic, regulatory and political climate.   

A major contribution of
              our project will be to explicitly include, and ultimately clarify, the role of
              the non-technical constraints of regulations, and in so doing, implicitly
              evaluate the conditional influence of the political climate upon the
              development of levels of performance for a US location. Although we will focus
              on a specific locale within the US [the Pacific Northwest], the adaptation of
              our approach to other locations in the US should be straightforward.
