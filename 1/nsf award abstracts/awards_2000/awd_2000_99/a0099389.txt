Abstract    :
              Modern multi-terawatt, femtosecond chirped pulse amplification lasers easily
              make possible studies of matter subject to unprecedented light intensities. 
              The interactions of  this laser radiation with various types of materials have
              accessed a new regime of strong field nonlinear optics, a regime in which
              perturbation theory breaks down and very high order nonlinear processes are
              possible.  The experimental work in this proposal is aimed at understanding the
              nonlinear optical properties of particles of sizes ranging from a few
              nanometers to a few microns in the strong field regime.  These studies are of
              interest not only because they will elucidate the electron dynamics in these
              strong field interactions but also because such studies may lead to enhanced
              conversion efficiencies of laser light to short wavelength light, and therefore
              have a direct bearing on the development of coherent, ultrafast-laser-driven
              short wavelength sources.
