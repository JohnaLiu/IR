Abstract    :
              The goal of the present proposal is to search for new physics at the
deepest
              subnuclear level in order to improve our understanding of natural
phenomena at
              the very highest energies as well as at the very early stages
of the universe.
              We plan to employ both the ``bottom-up''
approach of supersymmetry and
              possible hidden extra dimensions in nature 
as well as the ``top down''
              approach where all particles are replaced by 
wiggly strings to seek new
              physics that can explain present experimental
observations related to
              neutrinos, dark matter and dark energy of the
universe, origin of matter etc.
              The results of this study may not only
broaden our understanding of the forces
              and matter in the universe but it
may also provide a window to its future
              evolution.
