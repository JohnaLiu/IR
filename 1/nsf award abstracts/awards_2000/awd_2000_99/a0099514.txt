Abstract    :
              
This grant supports the participation of the Penn State University in
the
              STAR experiment at Brookhaven, including a full time research
associate, Akio
              Ogawa, at Brookhaven Lab. The principal interest of the
Penn State group
              involves the study of proton spin structure with
experiments using polarized
              proton beams at RHIC. The approved upgrades
to the STAR detector for this
              physics include an EMC (Electro-Magnetic
Calorimeter). As this system comes
              online, STAR will be capable of
reconstructing the higher rate, higher
              transverse momentum interactions
that are needed for polarized structure
              function measurements. The
utilization of these new features for a meaningful
              measurement of proton
spin structure presents a very large software challenge.
              Penn State is
developing software that will be required to simulate, collect
              and
analyzed these data from STAR. Some polarized proton running at RHIC
              is
expected each year for the next several years and will likely be
              in
increasingly important component of the STAR program.  The
              central
objective of these experiments will be the measurement of
              the
contribution of gluon fields to the proton spin.
