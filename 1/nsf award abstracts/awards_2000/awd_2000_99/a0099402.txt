The dynamical evolution of collisions between heavy
              ions at medium energies, such as those studied experimentally at Michigan State
              University and other laboratories, will be studied in a framework of a
              semi-classical mean field approximation with an addition of density
              fluctuations.  The major issues of the study are a) the nature of the
              disassembly of the excited nuclear system, b) the time scales of this
              disassembly, and c) the equilibration of different degrees of freedom.
