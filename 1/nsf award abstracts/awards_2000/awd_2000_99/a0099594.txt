Abstract    :
              This project will develop industry purchasing power parity (PPP) for research
              and development (R&D) at the detailed sector level for several OECD countries. 
              Development of PPPs for the service sector will also be explored.  The
              construction of the R&D PPPs will utilize national source data coupled with
              follow-up interviews with R&D firms to validate and improve the results.  These
              PPPs will be used with newly created PPPs at the industrial sector output level
              to construct metrics of effort, efficiency, and competitiveness.
