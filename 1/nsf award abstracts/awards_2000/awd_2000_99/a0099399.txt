Abstract    :
              We want to investigate several projects in Dynamical Systems 
and in Partial
              Differential equations. We will also 
consider multi-particle systems that
              share properties with both/
One unifying thread is that we would like to
              understand the relation 
between variational approaches and more geometric
              ones. 
In particular, we would like to produce proofs of diffusion 
that use
              geometric and variational methods and to 
extend  results in  dynamics
              obtained by variational methods to partial 
differential equations. An
              important tool for 
geometric methods is the theory of normally hyperbolic
              
manifolds and we would like to extend it to Partial differential
equations
              and infinite particle systems.

Sometimes, small  short range causes may have
              large long term 
effects. For example, small periodic  forces may build up
              large changes in energy. 
Some small changes in  the local properties of 
a
              material may lead to the emergence of patterns that cover large distances. 
In
              other situations, however, local effects just average out.
We would like to
              device a broad based array of methods (including 
numerical studies and
              geometric techniques)
that can be used to decide whether build up or
              
averaging occurs. We would also like to pay special attention to
some
              concrete models appearing in technological applications.
