This award supports acquisition of a DNA microarray reader
              and supporting equipment.  The equipment is required for studies of the
              simultaneous  expression of all genes found in the genomes of yeast and other
              organisms.  Such analysis of whole genome expression is usually referred to as
              functional genomics;  the cost of purchasing and operating the equipment needed
              for functional genomics is high enough that it is generally beyond the means of
              single undergraduate institution.  The equipment purchased through this award,
              though located at one institution, will be available to a consortium of college
              faculty from across the country who desire to pursue such research, but
              currently lack access to the necessary equipment. Research to be enabled by the
              equipment includes studies of the effect of aging and of DNA-binding chemicals
              on  gene expression in yeast.  In addition, several participating faculty will
              collaborate on an effort to develop new algorithms for mathematical analysis of
               DNA microarray datasets. The users are members of a group of 23 faculty (from
              the US and Canada) who have formed the Genome Consortium for Active Teaching
              (GCAT). During the 2000-2001 academic year, GCAT will coordinate a series of
              functional genomics experiments using yeast DNA microarrays that can be
              measured using the equipment provided through this award.  The research efforts
              are expected to have a substantial impact on undergraduate training (including
              that of women and underrepresented minorities) in an area of biology of major
              importance.
