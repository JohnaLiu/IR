Abstract    :
              When ultraviolet light or soft x-ray radiation is used to illuminate a gas, it
              is possible for light particles (photons) to be absorbed by atoms, resulting in
              the emission of electrons (photoelectrons).  This process is termed
              photoionization.  It can be used to probe the electron structure of atoms and
              the interactions among the various atomic electrons.  Here the theory of these
              interactions will be investigated, especially for electrons lying deep within
              the atom.  One problem to be studied is core relaxation, the rearrangement of
              the remaining electrons in the atom after the departure of the photoelectron. 
              Another problem is core polarization, the change in the arrangement of the
              remaining electrons in the presence of the departing photoelectron.
