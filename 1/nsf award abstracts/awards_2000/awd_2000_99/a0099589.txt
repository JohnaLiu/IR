Abstract    :
              It is intended to study quantum effects in basic plasma processes (as occur in
              stellar interiors), and their consequences for plasma reaction rates and
              equations of state, with applications in stellar evolution (including the solar
              neutrino problem)  and in the early universe (its energy density). The studies
              will utilize the novel multiparticle quantum code recently developed at UCLA,
              which is designed to handle hundreds of quantum particles.
