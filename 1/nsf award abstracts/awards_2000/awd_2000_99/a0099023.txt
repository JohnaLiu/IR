Abstract    :
              The PI will test the Kennett et al. (2000) hypothesis that the prominent
              negative late Quaternary carbon-isotopic shifts in the Santa Barbara Basin
              cores resulted from methane hydrate dissociation.  The PI will study the
              molecular-isotopic record of two sets of samples from the interval with the
              high-amplitude negative isotopic anomalies in both the benthic and planktic
              foraminifera.  The biomarker record of organic carbon, especially from
              source-specific products of sedimentary microbes and algae could contribute
              independent evidence to test this and alternative hypotheses.
