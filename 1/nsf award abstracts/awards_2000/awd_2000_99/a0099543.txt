Abstract    :
              A program of research in theoretical physics will bring
together particle
              physics, gravitation, and cosmology to
focus on the physics of ``dark energy''
              --- what is now
known, from numerous observations and experiments, to be
the
              dominant form of energy in the Universe. The work will
develop theoretical
              models and develop tests which can be
used to reveal the properties of the
              dark energy.  The dark
energy exemplifies the synergistic relationship
              between
fundamental theory and cosmology. Discovery of the nature
of the dark
              energy will have a basic impact on many
branches of physics.
