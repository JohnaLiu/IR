Abstract    :
              This project involves the study of polarized electron collisions with chiral
              molecules and heavy noble gas atoms.  The proposed experiments address basic
              physics questions about the dynamics of electron-molecule and electron-atom
              scattering, particularly with regard to electron-spin-dependent effects.   For
              example, one experiment involves examining how molecular chirality influences
              scattering dynamics in electron-molecule collisions.   The work also provides
              important information for applications requiring knowledge of electron-molecule
              and electron-atom scattering cross sections.  Finally, improved sources of
              polarized electrons will be developed, with the goal of providing a "turnkey"
              polarized beam for general applications.
