This research project will examine gene
              expression as cells exit from stationary phase.  The dynamics of mRNA
              accumulation, including rates of mRNA turnover, will be determined using
              microarray analysis.  Data analysis will be carried out using the clustering
              and visualization program, VxInsight, to identify specific patterns of
              regulation. The relative abundance of selected transcripts will be confirmed by
              northern analysis.  To determine if genes induced during this process are
              essential for exit from stationary phase, strains carrying deletions of genes
              that are highly induced during stationary phase and reproliferation will be
              analyzed for growth-phase specific defects and other stress-related phenotypes.
               This will be done by both microarray and more classical growth analyses of
              strains carrying deletions in genes whose mRNAs are most abundant during these
              processes.  This work will contribute to our understanding of microbial
              physiology at the genomic level and provide insights into the dynamics of
              quiescent cells.
