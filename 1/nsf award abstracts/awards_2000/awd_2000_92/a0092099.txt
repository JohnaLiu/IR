This research program studies the nature of the phase
              transformation involved in the formation of the ferromagnetic tau-MnAl (L1o)
              phase in MnAl-base magnetic materials. The evolution of microstructure and
              defect structure which governs the development of magnetic properties in bulk
              alloys and thin films is examined. The research builds on the revelation that
              the metastable tau-MnAl phase emerges as the product of a massive
              transformation and that the microstructure and defect structures which evolve
              depend critically on the mechanistics of this phase transformation. The goal of
              this investigation is to use the fundamental knowledge of the transformation
              mechanism as a pathway for the design of new alloying strategies, heat
              treatments, and processing schemes to tailor the structure-property
              relationships in these materials. This research should also contribute to our
              understanding of an important genre of solid-state transformation.

These
              magnetic materials have tremendous potential in futuristic permanent magnet
              applications and for thin film devices including magnetic recording media. The
              full potential of the MnAl-base ferromagnets will only be realized when the
              evolution of microstructure and defect structure can be systematically
              controlled since their magnetic properties are extraordinarily sensitive to the
              structural state of the tau-MnAl phase.
