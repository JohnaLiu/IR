	This research investigates how computer automation is
              contributing to changes in the status, conceptualization and use of knowledge
              in American society by means of a case study of legal information. The
              researcher, a cultural anthropologist from the University of Kansas, will
              investigate the impact of artificial intelligence in the form of expert systems
              for automated processing of legal procedures and computer assisted legal
              research.  The difference between the traditional conceptualization of the law
              as a hierarchical, taxonomic form of knowledge and the more contemporary
              computer-influenced conceptualization of computerized keyword searching, which
              implies a more horizontal, loosely structured network will be studied for its
              impact on the practice of law.  Methods include a literature search and
              inventory of legal expert systems, open ended interviews with legal theorists
              and practitioners in law firms and courts, and comparative research in Europe
              and Australia where the use of legal expert systems is more advanced than in
              the USA.  The research will plot the number of citations to non-legal sources
              in opinions issued by selected state Supreme Courts and Federal District Courts
              over the past forty years, as well as perform other quantitative analyses to
              assess the permeability of the boundary between the law and other disciplines. 
              This research should advance our understanding of the impact of computerized
              information technologies on legal institutions.  The new knowledge to be
              created will be valuable to theorists as well as practitioners of the law.
