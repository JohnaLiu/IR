This project entails a five-year program of research
              and education.  Research focuses on the development and evolution of extreme
              shapes in animals. Dung beetles of the genus Onthophagus (Coleoptera:
              Scarabaeidae) often produce extraordinary horns not unlike the enlarged antlers
              of elk or moose. Horns in beetles generally are produced by males, and are used
              in aggressive contests over reproductive access to females. Here, building on
              almost ten years of prior research with these animals, the PI will integrate
              approaches of development, genetics, evolution, and behavior to eludidate
              mechanisms underlying the evolution of diversity in horns of beetles and to
              examine how functional costs of horn production may constrain their evolution.
              This research program is designed to provide meaningful research experiences
              for motivated undergraduates at all levels of the scientific process (design
              and implementation of experiments, analysis, writing, and dissemination of
              results). The PI will design a course on evolution that builds on this research
              program, as well as others at the University of Montana, so that immediate and
              tangible research projects provide vehicles for conveying major concepts in
              biology. This research- and concept-based approach to teaching evolution will
              also entail student internships in local high school biology classrooms, as
              part of an existing outreach program between the biology department at the
              University of Montana and the community at large.
