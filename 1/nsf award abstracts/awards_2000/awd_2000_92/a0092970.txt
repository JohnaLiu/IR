Abstract    :
              Animation is a tremendously powerful medium of expression.
Ideas that would be
              complex or even impossible to express
with still images or words can easily be
              conveyed using
animated sequences. Unfortunately, even when the concept to
be
              conveyed via animation is simple, the process of
producing the animation is
              inordinately difficult. Indeed,
this is one of the reasons computer animation
              has become so
dominant - it holds the promise of automating, and
              thus
significantly simplifying, the production process. Sadly,
the process of
              transferring ideas into computer animations
is still far from simple. For
              example, the animated feature
film Toy Story 2 required extremely hard work by
              as many as
200 highly skilled computer and animation experts for more
than
              three years.

My career goal is to develop the concepts and algorithms
that
              will enable effortless, rapid development of realistic
animations that
              effectively convey the creator's purpose.
This research hopes to create the
              theoretical and
experimental foundation for building much more
              powerful
animation tools than exist today. Such tools will sharply
reduce the
              production time needed by skilled animators and,
more importantly, enable
              average computer users to express
their ideas through animation. Such tools
              will also help
educators teach more effectively and allow each one of us
              to
become creators and directors of personal and fictional
stories. Only when
              animation production is easier will
animation be as commonplace on the web as
              images and text
are today. Moreover, intuitive methods for creating
realistic
              human motion will further enable the creation of
human avatars in
              tele-presence applications, new
anthropomorphic human-computer interfaces, and
              realistic
digital actors in feature films and video games. Computer
animation
              will not achieve its full potential until 1)
animation tools require little or
              no skill, 2) an animator's
creativity is not stifled by the limitations of
              the
animation tools, and 3) the animation systems are available
to every
              person with a computer and a story to tell. I hope
to significantly contribute
              towards these goals.

At the heart of this research is the observation that
              the
animator's creativity will not be fully realized until it
becomes easier
              to produce realistic motion sequences. This
problem is tremendously
              challenging because the underlying
physical models of motion are difficult to
              create and
control. I believe that the solution lies in the creation
              of
highly-flexible realistic motion libraries, together with
tools to modify
              them intuitively and extensively. The power
of libraries stems from the
              ability to reuse already
existing high-quality motion, reducing the need
              for
animation skills. In this paradigm, the process of animation
turns into
              selecting the specific motion library, and
modifying a set of motion
              properties that transform the
original motion into a final animation.

In my
              research, I propose to develop a methodology for
creating and using realistic
              motion libraries flexible
enough to be used in a wide range of applications.
              In 1995,
I proposed the use of motion transformation as new way to
create
              animations  - a method fundamentally different from
the traditional way of
              creating animations from scratch.
This transformation approach is particularly
              useful for
modifying realistic motion data captured from real-world
actors.
              Unfortunately, during the transformation process,
much of the realism tends to
              be lost. Recently, I published
a novel transformation approach which
              demonstrates that
animations can be intuitively transformed into a wide
              range
of new sequences without violating the fundamental dynamic
properties
              of motion. The realism is preserved by
maintaining a model of the dynamic and
              biomechanic
properties of the animated character.

In the future, I will
              further develop mathematical models
that can be combined with real-world data
              to create reusable
motion libraries. Aside from preserving the realism
              of
motion, the most important requirement for effective motion
libraries is
              the flexibility with which the libraries can be
adjusted to meet the needs of
              an animator. I plan to achieve
this flexibility by decomposing a character's
              motion into a
fundamental component and a style component in a way
that
              allows us to independently transfer these components to
new characters. For
              example, the animator can produce a
child's cheerful run sequence by starting
              with a running
motion library extracted from the captured human run.
              This
motion can be modified by applying a happy, exuberant motion
style,
              which is then transferred to an animated character of
a small child. Such
              decoupling of the fundamental motion,
style, and performing character provides
              an extremely
powerful and flexible animation paradigm that can produce a
wide
              range of animations from a very small motion dataset.

The main goal of the
              educational component of this proposal
is to demonstrate the utility of
              advanced animation tools in
education and story-telling. I am particularly
              interested in
introducing these new animation tools to Seattle
              high-school
students to verify that our research does indeed empower
every
              story-teller with an accessible medium of expression.
I am also planning a
              project-oriented animation course
intended for undergraduate and graduate
              students involved in
animation research, as well as in art and music.
              Together,
the students will work on using our tools to create an
artistic
              short film project. This synergistic effort will
expose the artists to the
              latest animation technology and
provide direct user feedback to students
              involved in
research. In addition, the created motion libraries as well
as
              the animation tools, will be freely distributed through
the web and CDs with
              the hope that they will help animation
become an effective communication
              medium across educational,
economic and cultural boundaries.
