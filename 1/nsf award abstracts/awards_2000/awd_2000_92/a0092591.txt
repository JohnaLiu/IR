Abstract    :
              In this project, trading agents---software programs that participate in
              markets---will be designed to ascertain the rules of auctions of interest and
              dynamically construct a decision representation.  A strategy generation engine
              is the component of a flexible trading agent that converts the inputs (user
              preferences, auction rules, and models of other agents) into a decisionable
              format. Game theory and Markov Decision Processes are techniques that will be
              applied to making decisions in these markets. Previous research in the area of
              trading agents assumes that the market configuration is predetermined. However,
              the Internet marketplace is far more fragmented; a particular product will
              often be offered for sale in a variety of auction formats. Thus, flexible
              trading agents are necessary. The software programs will be made publicly
              available as Web-based learning materials for e-commerce courses. These
              materials will enable instructors in e-commerce and artificial intelligence
              courses to use trading agent games for class projects.
