Abstract    :
              This research endeavors to consolidate and extend gains in the systematic
              processing of nanostructured polymeric materials.  Most specifically, for
              electro-optic materials, attention will be paid to improving
              thermal/photochemical stability and material optical loss, while continuing to
              improve electro-optic activity and material processability.  This will be
              accomplished by incorporating free radical scavenging moieties and effecting
              more systematic crosslinking exploiting the structural features of dendritic
              supramolecular building blocks.  Chromophores will continue to be improved
              exploiting lessons learned from previous research.  Moreover, the development
              of improved octupolar, as well as dipolar, chromophores will be undertaken. 
              Chromophore ligands will be used to develop new two-photon polymeric materials
              exhibiting record levels of optical nonlinearity, which can be exploited for
              sensor protection, optical circuit fabrication, medical imaging, and ultrafast
              all-optical switching.  Dendritic ligands will also continue to be developed to
              further refine light harvesting relevant to optical amplification and solar
              cell applications. 
%%%
This research is tied together by a common
              theoretical basis and by a modular approach that permits material components to
              be applied to several applications.  The development of multiple use materials
              and nanostructural construction concepts my enable a relatively small, but
              focused, materials research effort to have high impact on a number of diverse
              technologies.
