Abstract    :
              David Son, Chemistry Department, Southern Methodist University, is supported by
              the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for developing
              new synthetic routes to cyclic and polymeric silazanes and carbosilazanes. The
              synthetic chemistry will be applied to the synthesis of novel organosilicon
              dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers containing -SiNSi-motifs. Repeated
              halogenation of monomers such as N(SiMe2H)3 followed by condensation with
              difunctional units such as HN(SiMe2H) can lead to cyclic oligomers or polymers
              depending on reaction sequencing and conditions.  The syntheses of cyclic and
              ethynyl-substituted oligomers will be investigated to determine ring size
              preferences and the reactivity of these unusual molecules. The small strained
              rings will also be characterized to determine their unique bonding
              characteristics.

In addition to their fundamental interest, these polymers
              and dendrimers may be useful hybrid inorganic/organic materials for ceramic
              films, degradable polymers, and other specialty applications. By participating
              in this project, undergraduates and masters students will develop expertise in
              polymer synthesis and characterization.
