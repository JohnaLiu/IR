Abstract    :
              Professor William Geiger of the University of Vermont is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry program to study organometallic compounds
              electrochemically in novel electrolytes.  Of particular interest are
              noncoordinating fluoroarylborate anions.  These substances afford increased
              solubilities and conductivities in low-to-medium polarity solvents including
              fluorous solvents.  Work in fluorous solvents is attractive because of
              possibilities of product/reactant/catalyst separation.  There are
              electrochemical advantages which allow the study of ion-pairing interactions in
              these systems.  The PI also proposes to study rhodium-based complexes
              electrochemically for the purpose of developing new synthetic pathways. 
              

The outcomes of the work will be relevant to many areas including
              electroanalytical chemistry, materials and sensor development, synthetic and
              industrial chemistry employing homogeneous inorganic or organometallic
              catalysis and in efforts to replace toxic organic solvents with environmentally
              benign substitutes.
