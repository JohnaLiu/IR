Abstract    :
              Donald Truhlar of the University of Minnesota is supported by the Theoretical
              and Computational Chemistry Program to study electronically nonadiabatic
              reactive collisions in the gas phase and nonequilibrium solvation effects on
              liquid phase reaction rates, using methods in theoretical and computational
              chemical physics.  In the treatment of electronically nonadiabatic reactions,
              issues to be emphasized are: (1) development of accurate quantum mechanical
              scattering theories to calculate well converged state-to-state reaction
              probabilities of systems governed by coupled potential energy surfaces, (2)
              development of new semiclassical methods based on improved treatments of
              decoherence and continuous surface switching, (3) testing of semiclassical
              methods against accurate quantum mechanical scattering results for a variety of
              systems, (4) development of new methods for diabatic representations of coupled
              electronic wave functions and coupled potential energy surfaces, and (5) use of
              these methods to study electronically nonadiabatic systems for which
              experimental data are available.  In the treatment of nonequilibrium solvation
              effects, issues to be emphasized are: (1) delineating the range of
              applicability of generalized Langevin solvents coordinates for treating organic
              reactions in solution, and (2) application of new methods to the reactions of
              diphenylmethyl chloride and bromide.  

This research will impact our
              molecular level understanding of chemical dynamics and solvation, which in turn
              will have implications in areas such as atmospheric and environmental
              chemistry.
