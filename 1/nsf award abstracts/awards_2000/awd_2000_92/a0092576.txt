This project involves the dissertation research
              of a cultural anthropology student from the University of California Los
              Angeles.  The project investigates how children growing up in a multicultural
              setting (Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain) use communication as a way to create,
              resist or contest new identities and social roles as cancer patients.  Using
              methods of micro-ethnography, qualitative cross-sectional study of 20 children
              and longitudinal study of four children, the student will study the children's
              use of both verbal and non-verbal communication in three discursive practices,
              teasing, joking and concealing. The project will examine how children negotiate
              and transform their Catalan and Spanish identities and social roles imposed by
              parents and caregivers in the context of their life-in the cancer ward of a
              hospital. The project will advance our understanding of bilingualism as well as
              communication of emotion in this institutional setting, will bridge linguistic
              and medical methodologies by examining emotion, in particular pain not only as
              a subjective phenomenon/experience but also as an intersubjective experience
              emerging in interaction.  Finally, the project contributes to the ethnography
              of children, who are relatively unstudied, advances our knowledge of this
              region of the world, and contributes to the training of a young social
              scientist.
