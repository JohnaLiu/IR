Abstract    :
              We will develop and calibrate a model of polyether polyurethane solid foams for
              the realistic 
computational simulation  of occupant-seat interaction in
              automotive engineering. The project involves theoretical, experimental, and
              computational work at the forefront of research on materials governed by
              nonconvex potentials.  This will be  a cooperative effort with the 
Safety
              Research & Development Group at Ford Research Labs and the
              computational
mechanics group of Prof. Cuitino (Rutgers).We will perform
              measurements of displacement fields using a novel, finite element-based image
              correlation technique. A set of tests on rate effects and hysteresis will be
              performed at Ford. We will also undertake an unprecedented factor analysis of
              microstructural features.  The  results will serve to calibrate the
              computational model, which 
will be based on nonlinear, homogenized periodic
              cell structures.
