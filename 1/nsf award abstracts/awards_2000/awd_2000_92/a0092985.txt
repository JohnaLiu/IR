Abstract    :
              This project has two main objectives: 1) to understand the current communication
              and coordination activities in the Hospital Operating Room (OR), focusing on
              the surgical team as the center of activity, and 2) to develop and test a
              theory of situated learning of decision skills.  The first objective will be
              met through observations of surgeries and interviewing key personnel.  We will
              collect video data, audio data, and code the communication activities between
              personnel in the room using verbal protocol analysis. We will also conduct a
              series of structured interviews with surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologists and OR
              staff to specifically ask these personnel about communication and coordination
              practices. The second objective will be met by developing a part-task
              simulation of the surgical environment using computer-based training, and
              measuring the ability to teach key situation assessment skills for various
              surgical cases with this simulation. This research will impact our
              understanding of surgical decision making, and provide a tangible means to
              train surgical decision making in a safe, simulated environment.  The impact of
              this research will be to reduce medical error, improve training practices, and
              improve team communication and coordination in the OR.
