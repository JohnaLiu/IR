Abstract    :
              The proposal addresses research issues of distributed vision. In particular, new
              techniques will be developed to vertically integrate vision algorithms that
              enable loosely configured large networks of cameras to be treated as a single
              logical sensor. The proposed work includes: 1) calibration of large
              heterogeneous sensor networks; 2) wide-area object tracking and recognition; 3)
              a cooperative processing framework; and 4) development of new distributed
              multimedia courses and a community outreach program
