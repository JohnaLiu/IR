Abstract    :
              Most words in natural language have multiple possible meanings.  This simple
              fact causes no end of difficulties for computer systems that seek to understand
              and generate natural language.  The semantic ambiguity of words impacts natural
              language subtasks such as prepositional phrase attachment and pronoun reference
              resolution, as well as large-scale applications such as machine translation and
              information retrieval.   Automatic methods that resolve ambiguity in word
              meaning have the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in natural language
              processing as a whole, but most approaches to word sense disambiguation have
              proven difficult to deploy on a wide scale because they are dependent on the
              availability of specialized sources of knowledge that do not exist across a
              range of domains.  The PI's goal in this project is to develop techniques that
              will ease and ultimately eliminate knowledge acquisition bottlenecks for word
              sense disambiguation.   He will achieve this by pursuing three specific
              objectives:  1) develop methods that automatically identify the most relevant
              contextual features for determining the sense of any ambiguous word;  2)
              develop disambiguation algorithms that learn from "just a few" manually created
              examples; and   3) develop unsupervised methods that allow any set of word
              meanings to serve as the target of the disambiguation process.   The combined
              effect of meeting these objectives will be to liberate word sense
              disambiguation from dependence on particular knowledge sources and thereby
              simplify their integration into natural language processing systems
