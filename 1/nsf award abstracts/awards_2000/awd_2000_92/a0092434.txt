Abstract    :
              The nucleophility of imidazole and benzimidazole carbenes will be explored. 
              Novel achiral and chiral [2.2] imidazolophanes will be synthesized and their
              nucleophilic reactivity investigated.  The educational component of the plan
              will introduce a form of collaborative learning into an honors organic
              chemistry lab course.  Students will be divided into small groups and visit
              several stations (self-contained experiments) during their lab periods. 
              Outreach to elementary schools in terms of demonstrations and hands-on
              activities is also part of the educational plan.

With this CAREER award, the
              Organic Synthesis Program is supporting the research and educational activities
              of Professor Steven T. Diver of the Department of Chemistry at the State
              University of New York, Buffalo.  The fundamental chemistry of a class of
              compounds known as imidazole carbenes will be studied.  Encapsulation of these
              carbenes into a rigid framework which may confer unusual properties onto these
              molecules will also be accomplished.  The educational portion of the plan will
              continue the PI's visits to elementary schools to give demonstrations and allow
              the implementation of the PI's cooperative learning modules into an honors
              organic chemistry lab course.
