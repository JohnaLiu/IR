unc-13 and Synaptic Neurotransmission in C. elegans

The
              long-term objective of this research is to better understand the regulation of
              neurotransmitter release in the nervous system. Many of the proteins involved
              in neurotransmitter release are known, but the mechanisms regulating the
              release process are not fully understood. The gene unc-13 in Caenorhabditis
              elegans codes for several protein products that are necessary for proper
              release of neurotransmitters at synapses. The roles of these proteins will be
              examined by (a) determining the subcellular localization of UNC-13 proteins
              using indirect immunofluorescence, (b) exploring regulation of unc-13
              expression through GFP fusions to putative promoters, and (c) identifying
              proteins that interact with UNC-13 using genetic screens and the two-hybrid
              system. 

The broad impact of this research project will be a more thorough
              understanding of the function of the nervous system. The study is
              scientifically important, because it will increase our knowledge of how a
              neuron sends a signal to another neuron, or to a muscle. Similarities between
              the nervous system of the worm, C. elegans, and more complex animals, including
              mammals, make C. elegans an excellent model organisms for exploring the details
              of neuronal regulation.  Laboratory techniques that would be prohibitive with
              mammals are straightforward in C. elegans. This CAREER research project will
              engage undergraduate students, including minority students, in cutting edge
              research. Some students will pursue independent research projects, while others
              will utilize research tools developed in the laboratory in their coursework.
              The research program will have an impact on basic scientific knowledge, and on
              the future careers of undergraduate students.
