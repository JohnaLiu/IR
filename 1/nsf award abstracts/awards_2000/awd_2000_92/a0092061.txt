Abstract    :
              The transition metal catalyzed [2+2+2] and [4+2+2] homo Diels-Alder reactions of
              norbornadiene lead to highly caged products with the creation of as many as
              nine new stereocenters from achiral precursors. Use of chiral bisphosphine
              ligands imparts significant stereoselectivity to these reactions. The proposed
              studies focus on the expansion of this chemistry to functionalized dienes and
              dienophiles and to other homoconjugated dienes, including
              bicyclo[2.2.2]octadienes. In addition, regiocontrolled cleavage reactions of
              the caged adducts will be developed, affording access to bicyclic targets.
              Synthesis of portulal and related diterpenes will illustrate the effectiveness
              of this methodology.

Formation of carbon-carbon bonds represents an
              essential component of the synthesis of the complex molecules displaying
              biological or pharmacological activity. Certain classes of reactions result in
              the formation of multiple carbon-carbon bonds in a single synthetic step, and
              in addition, such "cycloaddition" reactions are often highly selective, forming
              only one of many possible isomers of the product. With this award, the Organic
              Synthesis Program supports the studies of Professor John K. Snyder, of the
              Department of Chemistry at Boston University. Professor Snyder is developing
              and exploring the use of an unusual type of cycloaddition reaction for the
              synthesis of complex polycyclic structures. Additional investigations of the
              chemistry of these complex structures lead to the development of novel and
              efficient strategies for organic synthesis, as illustrated by the synthesis of
              a plant growth regulator, portulal.
