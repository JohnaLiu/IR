Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Southern California
              will acquire an X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector for small molecule
              diffractometry. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including the following: a) studies on metal hydride complexes and other metal
              compounds; b) covalent fluoride, oxofluoride and nonmetal main group chemistry;
              c) studies of long lived carbocation salts and related studies; d) studies on
              organic light-emitting diodes; e) ruthenium complexes as polymerization
              catalysts; and f) synthetic and mechanistic organotransition metal
              chemistry.

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements
              of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances
              and angles, and it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement
              of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.  These studies will have
              an impact in a number of areas, including the preparation of more efficient
              catalysts and materials chemistry.
