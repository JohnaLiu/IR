Abstract    :
              As the complexity of dynamic systems and networks grows through the continuous
              deployment of embedded systems and the availability of novel sensor and
              actuator technologies, the likelihood of temporal or permanent failures at
              certain components or communication links increases significantly and the
              consequences can become highly unpredictable and severe.  Even within a single
              digital device, the reduction of voltages and capacitances, the shrinking of
              transistor sizes and the sheer number of gates involved has led to a
              significant increase in the frequency of so-called "soft-errors," and has
              prompted leading semiconductor manufactures to admit that they may be facing
              difficult challenges in future.  The occurrence of failures becomes a major
              concern when the systems involved are life-critical (such as military,
              transportation or medical systems), or operate in remote or inaccessible
              environments (where repair may be difficult or even impossible).  
The
              synergistically developed research and educational programs of this project aim
              at obtaining systematic approaches for modeling, detecting, identifying and
              correcting failures in order to ensure the proper functionality of
              discrete-time dynamic systems or networks.  Unlike traditional control where
              the goal is to stabilize a given dynamic system (while perhaps maintaining some
              sort of optimality in the applied control input), a fault-tolerant design aims
              at ensuring that any deviation from the expected system behavior is confined
              within a small time interval (usually one discrete-time step).
In addition,
              the designer of a fault-tolerant system needs to account for the possibility of
              failures in the sensors or communications links, or even in error
              detecting/correcting mechanism itself. 
This project takes a system-theoretic
              viewpoint towards the design of fault-tolerant dynamic systems.  The main goals
              are to obtain resource-efficient fault-tolerant implementations and to
              characterize their fundamental limitations by jointly exploiting system-,
              coding-and information-theoretic techniques.
