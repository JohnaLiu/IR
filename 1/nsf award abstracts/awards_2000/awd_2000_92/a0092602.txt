Abstract    :
              This CAREER project addresses the formation, strain relaxation, and
              morphological evolution of metamorphic buffer layers and their impact on the
              properties and performance of device applications specific to the wireless
              communication industry. Buffer layers based on Sb-containing alloys will be
              studied to achieve flat and low defect layers. Layer designs that reduce
              roughness and threading dislocations will also be studied. Properties will be
              characterized using a in situ (Multi-Beam Optical Stress Sensor, Reflection
              High Energy Electron Diffraction, Scanning Tunneling Microscopy)and ex situ
              (triple axis x-ray diffraction, transmission electron diffraction,
              photoluminescence, Hall measurements) techniques to assess microstructure and
              morphology, and their impact on electronic and optical properties.
              Additionally, MHEMT devices will be fabricated based on optimized metamorphic
              buffer layers, tested, and performance compared to the state-of-the-art
              devices. The project will be integrated into educational activities that
              include undergraduate and graduate curriculum development, undergraduate
              research opportunities, and outreach to young women.
%%% The project addresses
              fundamental research issues in a topical area of materials science having high
              technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science
              and physics knowledge at a fundamental level to important aspects of
              electronic/photonic materials. The scope of the project will expose students to
              challenges in materials synthesis, processing, and characterization. An
              important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, outreach
              to young women, and the integration of research and education. ***
