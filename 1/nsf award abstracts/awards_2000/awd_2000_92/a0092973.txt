Abstract    :
              This is a computer graphics project that will research the interactive rendering
              of large-scale geometric datasets.  This is an increasingly crucial problem
              because model sizes grow faster than the hardware speeds up.   Specifically,
              this project will study:

- perceptually-based simulation,

- out-of-core
              and distributed simplification, and

- dynamic simplication.

The material
              will also be used to design and teach computer graphics courses, in order to
              foster student talent and interest.
