Abstract    :
              Amphibian metamorphosis provides a unique opportunity to understand the changes
              necessary to adapt from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment.  Within a
              single lifetime, an amphibian must undergo structural and physiological changes
              that allow it to make the transition that took our ancestors millions of years.
               The goal of this project is to determine the structural and molecular features
              of the amphibian nose that adapt it to smelling in air vs. water.  In this
              study, the detailed structure of the nose in larvae and adults of a
              representative salamander, caecilian, and frog, and lungfish (the closet living
              relative of tetrapods) will be examined by histology, scanning electron
              microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.  In addition, the genes that
              code for odorant receptor proteins (the proteins that actually bind and respond
              to smells) will be cloned from each of these species and the stages and regions
              of the nose in which the genes are expressed determined.  Finally, experiments
              with vital dyes will be used to determine which regions of the nose are exposed
              to water vs. air in living animals.  The results from this study will provide
              the first broad overview of metamorphic changes in the amphibian olfactory
              system, and of adaptations of the adult nose for smelling water.  This research
              will significantly enhance our understanding of the changes in the olfactory
              system that occurred in the ancestry of amphibians, and thus in our own
              ancestry; in addition, this research at an undergraduate institution (RUI) will
              provide an important opportunity for undergraduate to gain the experience,
              skills and perspective needed to attract them to, and prepare them for, a
              career in science.
