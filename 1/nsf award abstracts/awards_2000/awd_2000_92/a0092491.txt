Abstract    :
              The project  addresses  research issues of handling complex texture patterns in
              the context of computer vision. The tasks planned include surface modeling and
              surface measurement, integration of surface models into synthesis and
              recognition algorithms, and object and scene modeling with a large range of
              cues such as depth and motion. The final stage of the project will be
              integration of visual cues in order to use surface models as the building
              blocks of higher level object and scene models.
