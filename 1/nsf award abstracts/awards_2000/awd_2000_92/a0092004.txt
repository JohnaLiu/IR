Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemical Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln
              will acquire an X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector for small molecule
              diffractometry. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including the following: a) development of synthetic routes to novel materials
              based on rare-earth nitrides and carbides; b) design, synthesis and
              characterization of chelate monomers; c) studies of novel ligands and
              complexes; d) polar hydrophobicity; e) asymmetric synthesis of peroxide natural
              products; f) mechanism-based inactivation of cysteine proteases; g) iron (IV)
              chemistry; h) tin (IV) chemistry; i) Mo/W polyoxoanion clusters; and j) Zn(II)
              box and dibox catalysts.

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and
              precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule,
              including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about
              the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. 
              These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, including the
              preparation of more efficient catalysts, materials chemistry, and biochemistry.
