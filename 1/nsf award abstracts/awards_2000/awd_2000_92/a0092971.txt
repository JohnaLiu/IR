Abstract    :
              This project investigates how informal collaboration in the workplace can be
              supported by calendar information available via personal digital appliances.
              The goal is to retain the flexibility and individual usability of personal
              devices while also enabling collaborative sharing of data, such as schedule and
              location information. However, the leap from personal use to group
              collaboration is not trivial, as individuals must assess what information they
              are willing to share, how they currently use that information, and how they
              value the benefits of collaboration. To explore these issues, the research will
              use probabilistic reasoning techniques to ascertain the likelihood of finding a
              colleague at a scheduled event. The system will analyze and distribute personal
              calendar information to faculty, staff and students at the PI's institution.
              Different visualization techniques offer trade-offs among precision, privacy,
              self-explanation, aggregation and effort in obtaining information. By analyzing
              the feasibility, adoption, use and social norms formed in response to these new
              capabilities, we contribute to the growing interest in informal collaboration,
              interfaces for serendipitous information, and the use of Bayesian
              networks.
