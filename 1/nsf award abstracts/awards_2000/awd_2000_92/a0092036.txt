Abstract    :
              This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program  will enable the Department of Chemistry at The University of
              California in Los Angeles to acquire a Fourier Transform Mass Spectrometer
              equipped with electrospray, electron ion and laser desorption sources. This
              equipment will enhance research ranging from singlet oxygen damage to
              biological tissues, to modification and synthesis of fullerenes, to dendritic
              based host molecules with multiple ligands for cell binding, to gated
              carcarands.  

Mass spectrometry is a technique used to probe intimate
              structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of
              organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules.  The acquisition of this
              capability in mass spectrometry is essential for carrying out frontier research
              in many fields of chemistry.
