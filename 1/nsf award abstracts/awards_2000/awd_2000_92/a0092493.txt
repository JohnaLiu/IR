Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program
              supports Lawrence Sita, University of Maryland College Park, for work on
              amidinate-based olefin polymerization catalysts. Compounds such as
              cyclopentadienyl dimethyl zirconium acetamidinate are activated with borate
              cocatalysts to provide an active species that promotes the stereospecific
              living Ziegler-Natta polymerization of olefins and the living
              cyclopolymerization of non-conjugated dienes. New catalysts will be designed,
              synthesized and evaluated. Kinetic analyses will probe the detailed mechanism,
              including identification of factors  that control the stereochemistry of the
              growing polymer chain. 

Polyolefins are a large class of commercial plastics
              that includes polyethylene and polypropylene. Block copolymers often show
              desirable properties such as elasticity, crystallinity, thermoplasticity and
              solubility. These new specialty plastics are used in the packaging, electronics
              and textile industries. Metallocene and amidinate catalysts provide routes into
              new and useful polyolefins.
