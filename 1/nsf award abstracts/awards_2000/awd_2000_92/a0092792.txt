Proposal
              Number: 0092792

Successful replacement of SiO2-based
              metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) gate dielectrics by
              a high-permitivity dielectric is a critical step in the continued drive to
              build smaller, faster, lower-power, more-integrated circuits.  The planned
              research addresses this challenge by integrating studies of extremely thin
              (<10nm) Al2O3/ZrO2 alloy film deposition, synthesis and evaluation of
              precursors, determination of reaction mechanisms and kinetic expressions,
              characterization of material properties of the deposited films, and measurement
              of the films' electrical properties via testing of capacitor and transistor
              structures.  The goal of the CAREER project is to develop a material system
              that has the proper materials and electrical properties that are required of a
              gate dielectric and that can meet the processing and integration challenges of
              a microelectronic device process flow.

The educational component of the work
              will involve integrating the MOSFET process, developed as part of the research
              program, as laboratory modules into an existing course on semiconductor
              materials processing.  It will also be used to design a new laboratory course
              for Vanderbilt's Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Materials Science.
