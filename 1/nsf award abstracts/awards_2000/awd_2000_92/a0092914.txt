Abstract    :
              Digital information has become an inseparable part of our daily life due to
              significant advances in affordable high-speed internetworking technologies,
              high performance computer and peripherals, and the World-Wide Web.  The
              explosive growth of the Web has imposed a heavy demand on networking resources
              and Web servers, resulting in long delays when requesting remote Web
              services.

This project will develop an integrated research and education
              program that investigates various effective and efficient strategies for
              caching information on distributed system such as Web caching to reduce service
              delays and wide-area-network bandwidth consumption.  The research work will
              focus on (i) gaining a deep understanding of important and unexplored
              characteristics of Web usage; (ii) developing accurate performance models of
              these characteristics to measure the effectiveness of existing and newly
              developed caching strategies; (iii) designing novel load-balancing techniques
              that best utilize the aggregated capabilities of distributed systems including
              cache servers and client machines; and (iv) developing scalable technologies
              for video caching.  Performance of these techniques will be measured via
              simulation and experimentation.  The research efforts will have a significant
              impact on the evolution of the Web.

The education part of the program is
              centered around various strategies to motivate and retain potential students
              for the graduate program that emphasizes quality research.  Through a healthy
              synergy of both research and education efforts, the PI will influence students
              through teaching and student mentoring, contribute to the research community,
              and impact the general public.
