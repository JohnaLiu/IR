Abstract    :
              The issue of evaluation for mathematics and science education programs has been
              a concern for the field of evaluation and NSF for several years.  The pool of
              qualified evaluators is not large enough to keep pace with the growing need for
              and interest in evaluation.  To this end, in 1996 the AERA Grants Program
              created the Evaluation Training Program (ETP), designed to train doctoral
              students in state-of-the-art evaluation theory and practice, and to stimulate
              the development of evaluator training programs at four select higher education
              institutions.  As the ETP winds down, there exists a window of opportunity to
              evaluate the program and use the experience gained to assist NSF in developing
              new programs to train qualified evaluators for mathematics and science
              education programs.  This proposal includes a formal evaluation of the ETP,
              meetings of ETP students and PIs and the creation of an Advisory Panel to
              assist NSF staff as they consider the next steps for NSF-funded evaluator
              training.
