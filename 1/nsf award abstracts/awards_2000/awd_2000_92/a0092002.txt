This grant provides three years of partial salary support
              for technical assistance in the stable isotope geochemistry laboratories at
              Penn State University.  Technical help will operate and maintain a facility
              consisting of six gas-source stable isotope ratio mass spectrometers and
              associated peripherals (i.e. gas chromatographs, elemental analyzers, vacuum
              lines).  Additionally, technician will train new users and students and develop
              new techniques utilizing continuous flow technology for compound specific
              analysis of Hydrogen, Oxygen, Carbon and Nitrogen isotope ratios of geological
              samples including atmospheric gases occluded in ice cores and organics and
              carbonates in modern and lithified marine, estuarine and freshwater sediments. 
              Research that will be facilitated at this lab is focused on studies of the
              biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen and the feedbacks
              between greenhouse gases, global climate, and terrestrial and marine
              ecosystems.
