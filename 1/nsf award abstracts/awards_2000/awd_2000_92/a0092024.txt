This grant provides three-years of partial salary support
              for a computer systems administrator within the Department of Geological
              Sciences at Arizona State University (ASU).  The technician will be responsible
              for oversight and maintenance of departmental wide computing facilities
              including a newly established Geophysics computing commons, the ASU CAMECA 6f
              ion microprobe facility computers, the active tectonics research facility, the
              computational geochemistry lab, the mineral physics computing lab and support
              of a soon-to-be acquired 8-node broad band seismic array (ASUArray).  This is a
              Phase I technician support grant under the Instruments and Facilities (IF)
              Program.
