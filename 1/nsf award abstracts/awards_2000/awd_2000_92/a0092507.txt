Abstract    :
              This proposal seeks modest support for two senior researchers in the field of
              photosynthesis, who wish to collaborate with others several others in the
              preparation of plans for a special issue of the journal "Photosynthesis
              Research"devoted to the history of this field of biology.  One of the PIs
              (Govindjee)  has for 13 years edited a feature of the same journal entitled
              "Personal Perspectives,"  which are prepared by investigators describing their
              careers and activities.  Twenty-six of these perspectives have appeared.  The
              proposed volume will build upon this record with other recollections and
              additional information in seeking to provide a historical overview of research
              in photosynthesis.

One PI (Govindjee) is especially well prepared for this
              project by his previous forays into history;  the other (Gest) is also
              well-recognized.  Their careers give them personal experience and knowledge of
              many of the key events and people that they intend to examine.   The PIs have
              been invited to spend time at Scripps Institution of Oceanography where they
              will work with two other senior scholars and researchers in this field (Andrew
              Benson and George Feher) to fine tune their plans for the special historical
              issue on photosynthesis research.
