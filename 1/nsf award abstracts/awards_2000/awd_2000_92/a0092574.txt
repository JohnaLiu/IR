Abstract    :
              Professor Daniel Neumark of University of California Berkeley is supported by
              the Experimental Physical Chemistry program to perform experimental studies on
              time resolved dynamics in molecular and cluster anions.  One of the goals of
              the work is to understand the significant differences in the gas phase and
              solution dissociation dynamics of solvated anions, paying particular attention
              to the effects of the excess electron.  The work continues studies using
              femtosecond photoelectron spectroscopy and also will include new investigations
              into photoelectron angular distributions. 

The fundamental study of anions
              in clusters will lead to insights about solvation of these species, which are
              of great importance in electrochemical and biochemical processes, as well as in
              chemical synthesis.  Understanding the changes that occur in reactivity when a
              process is transferred from the gas to the solution phases will allow us to
              better utilize decades of gas phase data in applications in the condensed
              phase, where most industrial applications occur.
