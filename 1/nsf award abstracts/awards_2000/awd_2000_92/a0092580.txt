Abstract    :
              Professor Dor Ben-Amotz of Purdue University is supported by the Experimental
              Physical Chemistry and International programs to perform experimental and
              theoretical studies on solvent effects on chemical reactions.  These studies
              combine pressure and temperature dependent Raman measurements with Monte Carlo
              simulations, quantum calculations and the development of new theoretical
              approaches to solvation modeling (based on molecular hard sphere and
              generalized mean field approximations). Experimental studies include
              conformational reactions, such as the gauche-trans isomerization of alpha,
              beta-dihaloalkanes, and addition reactions, such as the condensation of
              methanol and acetone.  The pressure work utilizes diamond anvil cells, making
              very high pressures possible. The theoretical component involves collaboration
              with Dr. Igor Omelyan of the National Academy of Science, Ukraine.  The PI
              seeks a global model to quantify the effects of solvation on chemical reaction
              and partition thermodynamics.  

Solvation has extremely important industrial
              and biological applications, and studies of reactions in solution are much less
              advanced than those of reactions in the gas phase.  A more complete theoretical
              understanding of this phenomenon could have an important impact.
