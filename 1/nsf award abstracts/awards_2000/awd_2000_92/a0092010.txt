Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, Texas A&M University  will acquire an Electron Paramagnetic
              Resonance (EPR) Spectrometer.   EPR spectroscopy will play a vital role in the
              studies of a) mixed-valence dimetallic complexes as models for biological
              hydrogen activation processes; b) metal-RNA interactions, metal-peptide
              complexes and dinuclear manganese (II) centers; c)  the magnetic properties of
              clusters and materials; d) tetrahydropterin-dependent enzymes; e) boron-boron
              and boron-carbon one-electron sigma bonds; and f) EPR of acetyl-CoA
              synthase.

An electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer is an
              instrument used to obtain information about the molecular and electronic
              structure of molecules. It may also be used to obtain information about the
              lifetimes of free radicals which are often essential for the initiation of
              tumor growth and/or a variety of chemical reactions.  These studies will have
              an impact in a number of areas, in particular biological chemistry and
              materials sciences.
