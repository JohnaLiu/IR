Abstract    :
              The combination of device complexity and design diversity point towards
systems
              that will be constructed from components that are both inherently
              and
observably heterogeneous. What is needed is a new design discipline
              that
accounts for inherently erratic component behavior, and facilitates
              the
design and implementation of robust and predictable systems.  

The
              necessary infrastructure for robust application development is being
developed
              within the context of a new system for cluster programming known as
Ice.
              Research proceeds along four axes: the creation of fully robust
data-transfer
              mechanisms, the exploration of advanced techniques for
adaptation, new
              approaches to automation and ease-of-use, and development of
the theoretical
              underpinnings of robust systems. 

The overall goal of this work is to
              develop a fundamental understanding of how
to build scalable clustered systems
              that ``work well'', even when some of the
underlying components do not. Such
              truly robust systems are predictable,
reliable, and available, perform well in
              spite of fluctuations and failures of
constituent components, and require no
              human intervention. One of the main
advantages of such systems is the
              reduction of the burden of administration:
new components are simply added and
              utilized to their full capacity.
