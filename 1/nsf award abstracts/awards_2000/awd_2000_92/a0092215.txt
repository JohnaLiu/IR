Abstract    :
              With this CAREER award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
              the work of Dr. Jeehiun K. Lee in the Department of Chemistry at Rutgers
              University New Brunswick in Piscataway, New Jersey.   The purpose of the work
              is twofold: 1) to understand the intrinsic hydrogen bonding ability of nucleic
              bases through a combination of gas phase mass spectroscopic acidity
              measurements and theoretical computations, and 2) to illucidate the enzymatic
              transformation of orotic acid to uracil, catalyzed by 5'-monophosphate
              decarboxylase, using kinetic isotope effects.

Dr. Lee plans fundamental
              studies to understand the fundamental chemistry determining the bonding between
              the pairs of bases of DNA and RNA, the molecules in biology  which store and
              transmit the genetic code.   Studies of the enzyme which transforms orotic acid
              to uracil, one of the bases in RNA, could lead to improved antitumor agents.  
              In addition to her own research and teaching, Dr. Lee is developing a mentoring
              network, the Rutgers Women In Physical Sciences Network, to increase the number
              of women choosing and surviving in careers in the physical sciences at Rutgers.
