Abstract    :
              The purpose of the conference is for individuals from leading edge projects who
              are creating ways to focus professional development on actual classroom
              practices and, more specifically, using video as a tool for professional
              development, to:

     * share lessons they have learned about video tape
              design, platforms and software that facilitates video              case study,
              and the use of videos with teachers; and

     * identify issues that still
              need to be addressed related to the use of video to improve
              instruction.

Researchers and Developers of such video programs will convene
              for three and one-half days to consider these lessons and issues, using four of
              five "cases" of video development and use to focus the discussion.  Based on
              these discussions, a monograph in print and web-based formats will be produced,
              which discusses the important challenges faced by professional development
              leaders as they develop and use videos in their own settings.  The monograph
              will capture the lessons learned about overcoming these challenges and about
              using videos successfully in a side range of settings.
