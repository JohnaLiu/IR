Abstract    :
              Professor Daniel Higgins of Kansas State University is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry program and Solid State Chemistry in the
              Division of Materials Research to perform highly spatially-resolved experiments
              on polymer dispersed liquid crystals.  The tiny droplets of liquid crystals
              studied here are of interest from standpoints both fundamental (for the new
              physics involved) and practical (optical device technology).  This work seeks
              to elaborate on previous studies in which near field spectroscopy was used to
              generate a local field to reorient molecules in the liquid crystal. The
              dynamics of electric-field induced liquid crystal reorientation and ion
              generation, migration and recombination are to be studied using new
              time-resolved forms of NSOM and multiphoton-excited fluorescence microscopy. 
              Droplet sizes will be controlled using latex sphere-produced templates. 
              

Work on new aspects of liquid crystals is especially timely because of its
              applicability to new materials for diffractive optics, switchable holograms and
              photorefractive devices.  The work is also related to nanotechnology and
              biologically important effects.
