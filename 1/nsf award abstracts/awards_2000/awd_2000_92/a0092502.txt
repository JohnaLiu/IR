Abstract    :
              PI's objectives are to establish a biomedical engineering research and training
              program
dedicated towards the development of novel artificial cells as
              drug/protein/gene delivery systems. He hypothesizes that encapsulation of
              naturally occurring cytoskeletal polymers along with naturally occurring
              regulatory cytoskeletal severing and cross-linking proteins inside liposomes
              will induce the formation of an artificial cell. Use of these regulatory
              proteins will allow me to engineer cytoskeletal polymer length, and
crosslink
              density. This will consequently influence the three dimensional cytoskeletal
              network's structure, and mechanical attributes. The resulting encapsulated
              cytoskeletal network's structure will impart its mechanical stability to the
              vesicle bilayer making it mechanically stable. These mechanically strengthened
              hybrid vesicles will have the unique ability to dynamically respond to
              externally generated shear forces through rearrangement of their cytoskeletal
              network. In essence these vesicles will self-heal themselves if sheared past
              their yield strain. 

The educational component of his goals is to train
              underrepresented African-American Undergraduate students with this award.
              Students will have the ability to participate in all aspects of the proposed
              research activities. Currently, there exists a shortage of minorities in the
              biomedical sciences. This proposal will help reverse this deficit.
