Abstract    :
              This award to Washington University is a renewal of an earlier one, and is
              supported by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the Chemistry
              Division and the Solid State Chemistry Program in the Materials Research
              Division.  In this project, William Buhro will develop refined
              solution-liquid-solid phase-separation methods to prepare nanowires and tubes
              from semiconductor alloys.  Nanowires with controlled composition, narrow
              diameter and quantum confinement regions will be prepared from indium and
              gold-gallium eutectic alloys at low temperatures for potential applications in
              blue and green light emitting diodes.  In addition, the project will study
              detailed mechanisms that affect light emission from the nanowires prepared from
              different semiconductor alloys.

Under the award, nanowires and nanotubes
              with defined size, shape and composition will be prepared from semiconductor
              alloys for potential applications in high performance blue and green light
              emitting diodes and lasers. The broader impact of the project is the
              understanding of the formation of nanowires from semiconductor alloys to be
              fabricated at lower temperatures with enhanced electrooptic properties at
              reduced cost.  In addition, the research program will provide a rich
              multidisciplinary education and training opportunity in materials chemistry to
              graduate and undergraduate students.
