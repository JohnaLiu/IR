Abstract    :
              The State Science & Technology Institute (SSTI) annual conference, "Beyond the
              Hype: Tools for Building Tech-Based Economics", will focus on practical
              applications of successful techniques employed for science and technology
              policy.  The conference will include a series of sessions tailored to examine
              the role of universities in today's economy.  The conference will help serve as
              forum for nurturing the alliances between university and economic development
              officials necessary for regions to compete in New Economy. One third of the
              sessions will be geared to topics addressing investment in universities and
              commercialization of university research.  A proposed series of
              university-related sessions would be incorporated into SSTI's promotional and
              marketing materials for the entire conference.
