Abstract    :
              Proof is central to the discipline and practice of mathematics.  In school
              mathematics proof is rarely encountered outside the realm of Euclidean
              geometry.  Recent reform efforts in mathematics education call on schools to
              provide all students with opportunities and experiences throughout the
              mathematics curriculum.  Yet little is known about the ways grade school
              students learn to conjecture, to justify and to prove mathematically.  More
              specifically, the grade-levels where least is known are 6th through 8th.  With
              this in mind then, the objectives of this middle school proof study are as
              follows:
    Understand the development of students' competencies in
              justifying and proving:
    To understand the conditions and pedagogy
              necessary to promote the development of those competencies; and 
    To
              develop teacher preparation and professional development materials designed
              both to enhance teachers' understandings of proof and to support them in
              fostering the development of students' competencies in justifying and
              proving.
