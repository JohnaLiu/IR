Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to enable the manag.  The project addresses
              four XML data management tasks: XML publishing from relational databases,
              transport of XML data over the Internet, storage of large amounts of XML data,
              and stream processing XML data.ement of XML data on the Web to be done
              efficiently  In XML publishing, a declarative mapping is specified from a
              relational database to XML.  The project develops techniques for efficiently
              translating XML queries on the view back into SQL queries on the relational
              database.  For XML transport, the project creates new compression techniques
              that exploit patterns and datatypes in a given XML data instance.  Today, it is
              difficult to store XML data in a relational database system, because XML
              differs radically from the relational model.  This project creates new methods
              for splitting XML data optimally into relations to be managed by a relational
              database system.  Finally, the project develops alight-weight XML query
              processing method, by providing a set of tools for simple XML transformations
              that can be combined into pipelines performing complex processing.  Several
              software tools will result from this project, and will be made available in the
              public domain, with an expected impact both on the research community and on
              the industry. Parts of this research project will be integrated in the database
              course being offered at the University of Washington.
