Abstract    :
              With this Accomplishment Based Renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular
              Chemistry Program continues its support for the work of Dr. Bart E. Kahr in the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington in Seattle.   The
              research involves the study of the intermolecular interactions which take place
              during crystal growth, and will use a variety of light measurements, including
              absorbance, luminescence, linear dichroism, linear birefringence, and circular
              birefringence (optical rotation).   

The influences of crystals on light
              will be used to image actively growing crystal surfaces and measure effective
              electrical charges.   Eventually it may be possible to provide a catalog of
              luminescent molecules for identifying particular crystal growth processes.  
              Combining effects from various optical methods, including optical rotation
              imaging, will make it possible to learn much about these changing heterogeneous
              samples.   Eventually it may be possible to design mixed crystals with
              prescribed optical properties, and to understand the role of mixed-crystal
              growth in the success of matrix assisted laser desorption ionization in mass
              spectroscopy.
