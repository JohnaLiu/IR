Abstract    :
              This project investigates the categorization of emotional ingroup and outgroup
              faces,  using event-related functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The
              goal is to compare the hemodynamic response to emotional ingroup versus
              outgroup faces. An investigation of the brain regions common to both types of
              processing will be informative regarding the existence of general emotional
              processing and facial processing pathways. A rich set of stimuli composed of
              targets drawn from a number of racial backgrounds will be viewed by subjects
              drawn from an equally diverse population. By assessing ingroup/outgroup
              processing differences across a much broader range of racial groups than have
              been examined in previous research, this study will extend understanding of the
              neural substrates of emotional and social facial categorization. Moreover, the
              use of event-related fMRI will enable comparisons with previous
              psychophysiological (ERP) studies examining the processing of outgroup
              emotional faces. This is a small grant for exploratory research, as part of the
              behavioral and cognitive science emphasis on cognitive neuroscience.
