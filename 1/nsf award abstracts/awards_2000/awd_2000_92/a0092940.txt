Abstract    :
              Professor Kathleen P. Howard of Swarthmore College is funded by the Experimental
              Physical Chemistry CAREER program to develop novel NMR and EPR techniques for
              oriented samples, and to apply these methods to problems in membrane protein
              structure and dynamics.  The nature of transmembrane helical interactions
              within bilayer lipids will be probed using advantages of orientation in liquid
              crystalline states of those lipids.  

Professor Howard plans to improve
              chemistry instruction at her institution at all levels, to be involved in
              national education and outreach activities through the Biophysical Society and
              to involve undergraduates in her research program.
