Abstract    :
              This is a high performance scientific computing project.  It will develop a
              class of robust scalable preconditioning techniques for solving large sparse
              linera systems, using multilevel recursive incomplete LU factorization
              techniques preconditioning techniques to achieve robustness.  This research
              will benefit sectors of American industry using large scale numerical
              simulations, such as aerospace engineering and nuclear reactor simulation.
