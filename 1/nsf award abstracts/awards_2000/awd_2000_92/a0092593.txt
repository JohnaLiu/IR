Abstract    :
              The goal of this research project is to develop agent-based systems--for
              electronic commerce, automated manufacturing, or supply-chains, for
              example--where the agents adapt their behaviors so as to maximize their
              individual rewards. A general predictive theory is developed, which can
              determine expected emergent behaviors from initial agent capabilities and
              interaction protocols.  A methodology for the engineering of utility-based
              adaptive multi-agent systems is derived from these studies. Finally, the
              theories are applied to the development of an incentive-compatible information
              exchange protocol and its implementation in a prototype information exchange
              multi-agent system. Information serves as a currency in the protocol, and its
              value is determined via the agents' adaptive behavior. The aggregate of all the
              users' knowledge, opinions, and biases are immediately accessible to all users.
              Such research is critical to begin to predict the emergent behavior of systems
              and to move in the direction of integrating multi-agent systems theory and
              practice. New graduate curricula with an emphasis on decentralized systems and
              an undergraduate course on agent-based software engineering will be developed.
