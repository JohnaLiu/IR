Abstract    :
              Cellular electrical activity controls neuronal activity. 
              Multi-subunit
membrane proteins called ion channels are directly responsible
              for cellular
electrical activity.  In addition to ion channels, many other
              proteins are
composed of multiple subunits.  Multi-subunit proteins have
              evolved to
exhibit regulation by mechanisms that include
              phosphorylation.
Stoichiometric analysis refers to the study of how the
              relative number,
composition, and structure of different subunits influences
              the activity of
a multi-subunit protein.  Such analysis has been applied
              spectacularly to
the study of the oxygen-carrying blood protein hemoglobin. 
              Our
understanding of hemoglobin provides a vivid example for
              introducing
students to the beautiful intricacies of the relation between
              protein
structure/function and physiology.  In contrast to our deep knowledge
              of
hemoglobin, relatively little is known about the stoichiometric behavior
              of
multi-subunit ion channels.  Thus, such approaches applied to the study
              of
ion channels may provide a deeper understanding of how these
              important
proteins work.  An powerful array of molecular and
              computer-based
bioinformatic tools has been combined here to reveal answers
              to
evolutionary and physiological questions of how ion channels work. 
              The
thrust of this CAREER proposal emphasizes the unity of biology on many
              levels,
thus benefitting both classroom and laboratory inquiry.  New
              information
gathered in the laboratory will be carried into the classroom.  In
              turn,
teaching helps inform which questions to ask in the laboratory.
