Abstract    :
              In this effort, the fundamental fluid mechanics and chemical kinetics that
              control acoustic radiation from flames are investigated, and, using this
              knowledge, the capability is developed for using acoustic measurements as a
              high-bandwidth diagnostic of heat release in turbulent flames.  Detailed flow-
              and  flame-characterization studies are performed over a wide range of Reynolds
              and Damkohler numbers.  Experiments include two- and three-dimensional velocity
              field characterization, hydroxyl (OH) planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF)
              to determine flame-front characteristics, and high-frequency pressure and
              temperature measurements using microphones and fine-wire thermocouples. 
              Measurements are made for different burner diameters and flow velocities to
              systematically assess turbulent velocity and length-scale effects on
              flame-generated noise, and also over ranges of equivalence ratio, inlet air
              temperature, and fuel type in order to assess the effects of laminar flame
              velocity, laminar flame thickness, and Lewis number on acoustic properties.
