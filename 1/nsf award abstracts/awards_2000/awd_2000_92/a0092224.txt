Abstract    :
              Working memory capacity is associated with activation of information from long
              term memory for the purposes of completing a current computational task. In the
              proposed model of emotion generation, emotions are emergent phenomena that are
              the result of applying complex emotion knowledge from long term memory to core
              affective feelings. Thus, working memory capacity should be involved in emotion
              generation, and should be directly related to emotional granularity. To study
              the role of working memory in the emotion generation process, it is necessary
              to first determine whether cognitive and emotional tasks operate via distinct
              systems of working memory. The proposed investigation would be an initial step
              towards addressing this question. This is a small grant for exploratory
              research, as part of the behavioral and cognitive science emphasis on cognitive
              neuroscience.
