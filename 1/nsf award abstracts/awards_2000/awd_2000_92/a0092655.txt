Abstract    :
              The central theme of this research plan is to formally study
numerical issues
              concerning algorithms for continuous
optimization. A primary goal is to
              address central topics in
numerical analysis - such as perturbation
              theory,
conditioning, and sparsity - in the continuous optimization
context.
              A second objective is to gain further insight into
interior point methods for
              convex programming. Special
attention will be paid to numerical aspects such
              as the
solution of the linear equations arising at each main
iteration and
              the effects of limited precision in arithmetic
computations. Properties of the
              central path and local
convergence results will be studied. Applications of
              the
analytical perspective for convex optimization in
probability and
              discrete optimization will be explored. The
educational plan involves
              activities both at the master and
doctoral levels. At the master level,
              further development of
courses in quantitative methods and applications
              of
operations research will be pursued. Special emphasis will
be placed on
              the role of mathematical models in a variety of
industrial applications. At
              the doctoral level, exposure to
interior point methods, semidefinite
              programming, and real
model computation will be provided through the
              graduate
nonlinear programming course, seminars, and reading courses.
