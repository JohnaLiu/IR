Abstract    :
              This project explores the question of whether American state supreme court
              justices vote strategically or sincerely.  The study will investigate, in
              particular, the agenda-setting stage and the decision-on-the-merits stage of
              judicial review.  Several hypotheses will be tested: 1) whether institutional
              rules that make retaliation more likely affects judges' likelihood of voting
              strategically; 2) whether strategic behavior varies in response to changes in
              federal-state relations and across areas of law with varying degrees of
              saliency; and 3) whether competing risks for judges are created by multiple
              actors who pose electoral and policy threats to state supreme court justices. 
              Cases from eleven years of state supreme court decisions will be collected in
              four areas of judicial review cases (campaign and elections, workers'
              compensation, unemployment compensation, and welfare). Data also will be
              collected on judge biographical characteristics, state elite and citizen
              ideology, as well as institutional rules, constitutional designs, and other
              state and court characteristics for each year during the 1994-2004 period.  In
              addition to these data, interviews will be conducted with state supreme court
              justices, members of the legislature, and the state governor in twelve American
              states with variation across institutional rules, formalized
              legislative-judicial relations, and political contexts.
