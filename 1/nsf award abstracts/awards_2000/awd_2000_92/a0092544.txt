Abstract    :
              In this US-Brazil experimental project, John Malin of the American Chemical
              Society (ACS) will initiate a pilot program of traveling seminars in Chemistry.
               In this project a group of first-rank U.S. scientists will visit several
              Brazilian institutions over a period of a month.  During this time the group
              will give colloquia in their specialty areas and interact with Brazilian
              colleagues and their students.  The mission to Brazil will be scheduled during
              the period June-August, 2001. In cooperation with the Sociedade Brasileira de
              Quimica and the Associacao Brasileira de Quimica, the American Chemical Society
              will coordinate visits at key research universities in some five locations.
              Participants will help develop a new climate of research interactions between
              the U.S. and Brazilian chemistry by establishing new personal contacts,
              assessing the chemical research environment of the institutions visited, and
              identifying special scientific opportunities.  The visit and the participants'
              report will establish a new basis for enhanced U.S.-Brazilian cooperation in
              the chemical sciences and also provide a model for interactions with other
              countries.
