Abstract    :
               Technology is clearly changing the way children live and learn.  What is not
              clear is how our classrooms will change in the future due to these new
              technologies.  Today there are numerous questions when it comes to infusing
              technology into the classroom environment, particularly when it involves early
              childhood education environments.  What will our pre-school classrooms look
              like with new technologies?   What, if any, are appropriate new technologies
              for young children?   Will early childhood teachers approach teaching in the
              same way? Will children learn differently because of these technologies?    In
              this research the PI will explore issues relating to the  development,
              evaluation, and dissemination of new technologies and infusion methods in early
              childhood education.  The goals are:  to understand the unique needs of young
              children (ages 3-6) in learning environments;  to develop new technologies in
              partnership with children and teachers;  To develop new strategies for teaching
              in a technology-infused early childhood education environment;  to understand
              the impact these technologies can have on young children and their early
              childhood educators;   and to understand when technology is an appropriate
              catalyst for early childhood education.  The research will be an important
              demonstration of new approaches in interfaces, technologies, and design
              practices for and with children, and will further offer new educational tools
              that can have a broad impact on how we educate our children in our classrooms
              of the future.
