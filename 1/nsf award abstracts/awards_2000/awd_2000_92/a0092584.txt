R. Lueptow, Northwestern University


The 12th
              International Couette-Taylor Workshop will be held at Northwestern University
              in September 2001 with Dr. Lueptow  as the organizer.   Besides Couette-Taylor
              flow, the research topics to be discussed in the workshop will include
              non-linear dynamics, instability, Goertler/Dean vortices, and other vortical
              flows.  It is anticipated the workshop will have 80-100 participants with 50-60
              contributed papers.  It provides an excellent opportunity for fluid dynamicists
              in this field of research to have an open exchange of ideas.
