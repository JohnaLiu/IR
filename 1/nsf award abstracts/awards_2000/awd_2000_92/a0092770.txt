Abstract    :
              With the rapid emergence of Internet related applications, providing integrated
              services such as data, voice, and video in mobile computing systems has become
              increasingly important. However, mobile communication
systems such as cellular
              networks are primarily designed for supporting voice. Due to the different
              workload characteristics and quality of service (QoS) requirements of
              integrated services, prior resource
management techniques may not be efficient
              for handling the increasing demand of emerging applications. To address this
              issue, the research focuses on the design and evaluation of (1) bandwidth
              management schemes
to provide QoS guarantees and efficiently utilize the
              frequency spectrum; (2) cache management mechanisms to reduce the bandwidth and
              power consumption; and (3) efficient protocols to allow mobile devices to
              power
off most of the time. The research proposes to integrate these three
              components to provide a resource management infrastructure that can efficiently
              support integrated services in mobile computing systems. The
research results
              will be used and emphasized in the wireless networks and mobile computing
              courses developed in this project.
