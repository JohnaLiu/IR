Abstract    :
              This action is for partial support of a field survey of the Marquesas Islands to
              identify evidence of the April 1, 1946 Aleutian tsunami, such as possible
              watermarks from the tsunami when it impacted the Marquesas. During a recent
              survey of a tsunami in the island of Fatu Hiva, large rocks were discovered
              that had reportedly moved inland in 1946 at about the time of the Aleutian
              tsunami, some as much as 300m.   The objective of this joint US/France
              expedition is to document these findings, take measurements, and investigate
              other anecdotal reports of similar tsunami rocks in other islands in the
              Marquesas, and assess the local impact of the April 1, 1946. tsunami 

This
              work is very timely, as the exact generation mechanism of the April 1, 1946
              Aleutian tsunami remains controversial -- it is often speculated that there was
              coseismic tsunami generation due to a massive landslide.  The existing
              hydrodynamic inundation data from Hawaii are not sufficient to perform
              meaningful hydrodynamic inversion to identify the likely source mechanism. 
              Discovering if a landslide was involved in the Aleutian tsunami is quite
              important now, as inundation maps for Hawaii are currently being re-evaluated,
              and inundation maps for the Pacific states of the US mainland are being
              developed for the first time.  Tsunamis from the Aleutians are a concern that
              needs to be carefully reassessed, particularly in view of the landslide
              potential.  The findings may also help re-evaluate the work in progress on
              landslide generation of tsunamis, which since the PNG event has helped refocus
              global tsunami hazard mitigation efforts.
