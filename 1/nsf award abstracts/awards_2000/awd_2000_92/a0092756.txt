This grant looks at the formation mechanism, coarsening
              behavior, and applications of nanoporous gold (NPG).  NPG is formed by
              dissolving silver from gold/silver alloys in acid, a dealloying process that
              leaves behind an open sponge of nearly pure gold.  By varying the experimental
              conditions such as the pre-alloyed composition and post-dealloying annealing
              time, the size of the spongy ligaments is tunable over length scales from 5 nm
              to many microns.  For this research NPG is a model system for studying
              nanoscale surface kinetics.  NPG films will be grown by electron beam
              evaporation, and the time evolution of the porosity will be characterized by
              SEM and TEM.  Coarsening behavior will be examined to measure surface
              diffusivity as a function of chemical environment.  The research includes
              refinement of a general-purpose atomistic simulation program.

NPG holds
              great promise in applications where high surface open structures are
              advantageous, e.g. sensors and electrodes. A simple MEMS hydrogen fuel cell
              will be built with NPG coated with platinum catalyst as the electrodes.
