Caves form as water flows
              underground, dissolving tubes and canyons that mark the water-table elevation
              at the time of cave development.  Relict cave passages and their sediments can
              thus be used to decipher the history of regional water-table lowering, which is
              often regulated by river incision or tectonic uplift.  The protective
              environment in a cave can preserve fragile sediments and minerals for millions
              of years, during which time the surface may be sculpted by erosion and tectonic
              forces may uplift entire mountain ranges in which the caves lie.  PI proposes
              to use caves and cave sediments in three distinct projects, each with important
              implications for regional climatic and tectonic geomorphology.  Cosmogenic 26Al
              and 10Be will be used to date sediments in a suite of large caves along the
              Cumberland Escarpment of Tennessee and Kentucky, which appear to record a pulse
              of regional river incision related to glaciation in the Ohio River basin.  PI
              will survey and date cave mineral deposits that mark ancient pools in the
              Sierra Nevada, California, to constrain tectonic tilting of this mountain
              range.  Beach-deposited sediments preserved in caves that are now high in the
              mountains of New Zealand will be dated to determine uplift rates in this
              tectonically active region.  In addition, PI will use this work to educate
              students and the public about caves and their unique hydrology through
              workshops, teacher training and educational literature provided to the National
              Park Service.
