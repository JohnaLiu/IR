Abstract    :
              Computing is rapidly moving away from traditional computers.  Programs
in the
              future will run on collections of mobile processors that interact
with the
              physical world and communicate over ad hoc networks.  We can
view such
              collections as swarms.  As with natural swarms, such as a
beehive or ant
              colony, the behavior of a computational swarm emerges
from the behaviors of
              its individual members.

This project focuses on developing methods for
              creating,
understanding and validating properties of programs that execute
              on
swarms of computing devices.  The work builds foundations to create and
              reason
about swarm programs in principled ways.  A promising approach is
              to
construct swarm programs by combining primitives.  The functional
              and
non-functional behavior of a primitive is described using
              formal
notations.  The project investigates techniques based on both
              experimental
and analytical approaches for predicting the functional
              and
non-functional properties of compositions of swarm primitives.

Although
              the practical applications of swarm computing are in their
infancy, there is
              great potential for useful applications.  Successful
swarm programming will
              depend on our ability to reason about swarm
programs and construct device
              programs based on high-level goals.  This
Project establishes the first steps
              towards that target.
