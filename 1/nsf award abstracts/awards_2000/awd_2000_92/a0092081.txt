Title: "QEIB: Quantitative Environmental
              Biology Workshop, Fall 2000"

The PIs proposes to hold a workshop to bring
              together leading environmental biologists, mathematicians, and statisticians to
              identify research opportunities for collaboration in environmental sciences. 
              Further, they will identify cultural inhibitions to collaboration, and possible
              programs to help foster collaboration.  The workshop will be held at the San
              Diego Supercomputing Center on the University of California campus, on
              September 7-9,2000.  The participants will produce a report and publication
              that will be broadly available to the community.  These documents will discuss
              the research opportunities and new modes of interdisciplinary interactions that
              the participants identify.
