Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemical Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wyoming will upgrade
              a 400 MHz Solid State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer. This equipment
              will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) zeolite catalyzed reaction
              chemistry; b) amorphous materials characterization and polyamorphic dynamics;
              c) spider silk and other biopolymer elucidation; d) ion diffusion in fuel cell
              and battery materials; e) solid state luminescence matrix characterization; and
              f) optical pumping and detection enhanced spectroscopy.   

Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists
              for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify
              unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
              solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
              who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will
              have an impact in a number of areas including materials chemistry, battery
              research, and catalysis.
