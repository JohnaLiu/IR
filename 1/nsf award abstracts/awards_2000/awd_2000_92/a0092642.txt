CAREER:  Ecosystem responses to rising CO2 and
              climate change: Feedbacks through the nitrogen cycle

Scientists now agree
              that concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere are increasing,
              and that this is causing temperatures to rise around the globe. Yet, how these
              changes will affect ecosystems, particularly processes that occur below ground,
              is not at all well understood. Nitrogen is required by plants, and both rising
              CO2 and climate warming could profoundly alter rates of nitrogen cycling in
              ecosystems and the ability of plants to acquire the nitrogen they need. For
              example, both warming and rising CO2 could change the way water moves through
              ecosystems, and thereby alter the process of decomposition through which soil
              microorganisms make nitrogen available to plants. This CAREER project combines
              research on how rising CO2 and warming will affect nitrogen cycling in soil,
              education of undergraduate and graduate students about the significance of
              these issues, as well as efforts to convey the findings of this research
              project to the public.
