Abstract    :
              0092504 Stern

The diapycnal heat and salt flux in an unbounded ocean with
              Prandtl number of 7, Lewis number of  0.01, and various density ratios between
              1 and 2, will be determined by a combination of numerical calculations from the
              three-dimensional and two-dimensional Boussinesq equations, The undisturbed
              state of the model consists of a uniform temperature and salinity gradients,
              wherein salt fingers form and eventually lead to a statistically steady state.
              The non-dimensional heat flux, i.e., the Nusselt number, and the heat/salt flux
              ratio then depend only on the Prandtl number, Lewis number and density ratio.
              The numerical results will be compared with observations taken in the Central
              Atlantic based on dye dispersion and on the Cox method for interpreting thermal
              microstructure. The numerically obtained flux laws should also be locally
              applicable to regions of the thermocline containing relatively larger vertical
              gradients in thin lateral intrusions of temperature and salinity on isopycnal
              surfaces.
