Abstract    :
               

This PECASE award is a longitudinal study of how elementary teachers learn
              to teach science. Of particular interest is supporting new elementary
              teachers--preservice teachers and teachers in their first four years
              ofteaching--in learning to teach inquiry-based science, and investigating how
              these teachers learn from a supportive, integrated, technology-mediated
              instructional resource and learning environment.

The research will
              characterize teacher learning and propose a mechanism explaining that learning;
              investigate ways that specific supports provided using technology and
              contextual features of their larger environment are related to that learning;
              and identify links among teachers' learning, their practice, and their
              students' learning. Research objectives will be met through interrelated series
              of longitudinal learning studies, design studies, community studies, and
              context studies.

As a context in which teacher learning and ways of
              supporting that learning can be investigated, an integrated instructional
              resource and technology-mediated learning environment for teachers called CASES
              will be developed. CASES will provide teachers with curricular materials they
              need in their first years of teaching, and will help them make sense of the
              complex ideas about science teaching in the context of their practice. The
              development of CASES will be based on a theoretical foundation grounded in
              current sociocognitive approaches to teaching, learning, and technology
              design.

The teaching plan involves integrating the CASES learning
              environment in the researcher's elementary science methods courses for
              undergraduate and masters students preparing to be elementary teachers. The
              work will also be discussed in a doctoral course, and doctoral students will
              serve as mentors for new teachers.
