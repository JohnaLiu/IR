Abstract    :
              This CAREER project combines a research component--designing a practical
              approach to program termination verification that includes both theoretical
              study and actual implementation--with an educational component--undertaking the
              enhancement, for both undergraduates and graduates, of programming language
              education.  The research on termination verification recognizes that,  in
              practice, the programmer often knows for some reasons that a particular program
              should terminate if implemented correctly and would therefore find great value
              in a termination checker able to detect program errors that cause
              non-terminating program execution.  Unfortunately, termination checking in a
              programming language that supports general recursion is often prohibitively
              expensive.  In order to design a termination checker for practical use, the
              project explores some recent results on the use of dependent types in practical
              programming, allowing the programmer to encode into dependent types the metrics
              needed for ensuring program termination and then use type-checking to verify
              that the provided metrics indeed suffice.  The research focuses on providing a
              mechanism that truly can be applied in practice.
