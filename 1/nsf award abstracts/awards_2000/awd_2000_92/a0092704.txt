Abstract    :
              Predicting and mitigating the effects of climate warming requires an integrated
              program of teaching, research, and community outreach.  This research program
              focuses on understanding the interactions among vegetation, climate change, and
              disturbances in northern biomes.  Interactions among these variables will
              likely produce complex vegetation dynamics over the next century that are
              different than models assuming simple correlations between climate and
              vegetation.  This work across a broad climatic gradient in Manitoba, Canada,
              examines long-term records in peat and lake sediments to reconstruct the
              temporal and spatial interactions of these processes at local, regional, and
              subcontinental spatial scales.  This research will be integrated into a new
              global change ecology curriculum at Carleton College, including courses in
              ecosystem ecology, paleoecology, global change biology, and plant physiological
              ecology.  Innovative teaching methods, such as case studies, inquiry based
              labs, and community service learning, are being developed for these courses and
              will be disseminated online for science educators nationwide.
