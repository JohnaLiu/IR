Abstract    :
              The project considers sandwich structures consisting of a relatively thick and
              weak but light core, sandwich between two strong and stiff composite material
              skins.  The emphasis in on large structures such as ship hulls and wind turbine
              blades.  The research includes development and refinement of: 
-a new "smart"
              manufacturing method
-an ultralight sandwich for aerospace use, developed
              mainly for general aviation aircraft such as the Cirrus SR_20
-a new heavy
              duty sandwich core, tailored for applications such as the US Navy's DD21
              destroyer.
The research encompass analytical and numerical analyses and
              optimization, experimental testing, and post-mortem evaluations.  The new
              knowledge generated will be transferred to the industry via an industrial board
              and to academia via both in-house courses and via intimate collaboration with
              two local undergraduate colleges.
