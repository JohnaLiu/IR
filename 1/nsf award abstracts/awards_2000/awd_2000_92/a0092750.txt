Abstract    :
              This is a very strong proposal in an important field with great potential for
              impact. Two applications proposed, one to composite materials processing and
              the other to cryopreservation. The application to cryopreservation is less
              focused but more exploratory; however, strong collaboration with other
              investigators in the latter area is noted. May want to consider how to obtain
              interfacial properties (measured or predicted from microscopic models such as
              the molecular dynamics method). How to account for asymmetry of dendrites?
              Two-dimensional modeling may have to evolve to three-D eventually in order to
              more accurately capture various phenomena.
