Abstract    :
              0092631
Rapid emerging information technologies (IT), new sensors, wireless
              communications, and high tech controls will likely form a foundation for the
              next generation of  transportation systems. To jump-start the evolutionary
              process a technology oriented basic research program is needed. This project
              outlines a plan for developing such a program centered around a workshop titled
              "A Basic Research Program for Surface Transportation Systems." The workshop
              will bring together 25 to 30 leaders in technology and transportation from
              academia and industry to structure the research program and draft a research
              project solicitation.

The purpose of this proposed activity is to develop a
              10-year basic research vision with a 25-year focus to be implemented through a
              partnership between the National Science Foundation and the US Department of
              Transportation. It will incorporate the technologies noted above that are not
              traditionally included in transportation research. The objective to identify
              "Areas of Influence" and impacts of science and technology on transportation
              from the perspective of those supporting disciplines.

The goal of this
              program is to support basic research that provides the science and technology
              to ensure the following:
1. The use of IT to make our surface transportation
              system safer, more reliable, and more productive.
2. The impact on our human
              and natural systems of the use of IT to sustain and revitalize our
              transportation system must be understood well enough that we can capitalize
              upon the opportunities it presents to improve performance, as well as to
              identify and mitigate any unwanted consequences.
3. Knowledge must be made
              available that will support "managing" both the complexity and the
              vulnerability of surface transportation systems.

Products from the workshop
              will include a report documenting a proposed 10-year research vision and the
              rationale behind the development of such a sustained program
