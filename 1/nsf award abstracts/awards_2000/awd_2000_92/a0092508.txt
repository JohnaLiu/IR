	This award provides funding for the construction and
              testing of a new high-intensity cesium sputter ion source to be installed in
              the accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) system at Purdue University. The new
              ion source is expected to improve the precision, detection limits and sample
              handling capacity of the Purdue AMS facility. The facility measures extremely
              small concentrations of 10Be, 14C, 26Al, 41Ca, 129I and other radionuclides
              that are used in research as tracers or in dating for a wide-range of research
              applications such as archeology and anthropology, paleoclimatology, landscape
              evolution, glaciology and paleoseismology.
