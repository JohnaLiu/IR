Song
Functional MRI (fMRI) is a new method that can non-invasively
              study brain function. Since its inception nine years ago, it has seen rapid
              progress both in the technical development and in vivo applications. However,
              there are still limitations in the acquisition methodology that may affect the
              reliability and sensitivity of fMRI. The need for more reliable, efficient and
              innovative imaging acquisition strategies that improve the sensitivity and
              specificity is urgent. In the meantime, the educational curriculum concerned
              with this new field is relatively limited and teaching materials addressing
              some current and critical issues are few.

In this proposal, we plan to
              develop new data acquisition methods and to create educational curriculum for
              fMRI. The first goal requires the development of fMRI acquisition methods that
              are reliable, sensitive and efficient. Specific emphasis will be placed upon
              improving the specificity of the functional signal to better co-localize with
              the neuronal activity, improving the sensitivity of fMRI to subtle changes, and
              recovering signal from brain regions that experience signal drop-out from
              large-scale susceptibility artifacts. The second goal requires the creation of
              undergraduate course work on MRI and fMRI and graduate research program for
              fMRI. The new educational curriculum will build a solid foundation of the MRI
              and fMRI knowledge for the students and also educate them with the latest
              development in the literature, thus better preparing them to participate in and
              contribute to this rapid evolving research field.
