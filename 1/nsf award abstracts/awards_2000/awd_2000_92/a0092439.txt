This grant provides partial support for the 2001
              Gordon Research Conference on Plant Herbivore Interactions, to be held in
              Ventura, California from 25 February to 1 March 2001.  The conference was
              organized to be forward-looking, and stresses new and emerging approaches and
              topics related to the interactions between plants and their herbivores. 
              Indeed, an agreement has been reached with all of the speakers, limiting
              presentations to issues at the frontiers of science.  The conference will
              feature 24 speakers.  To maximize the likelihood of including novel coverage,
              23 of the invitees have not spoken at the conference in the last 6 years.  Nine
              are from outside the US and four are female.  Moreover, a broad cross section
              of ages is represented in the suite of speakers.  The lead presentation will be
              by the founding director of the Max Plank Institute for Chemical Ecology, Ian
              T. Baldwin.

Diverse topics will be considered at the conference, including
              herbivore-induced defenses, herbivore-pathogen communication, community and
              multi-trophic interactions, mechanisms at the plant-herbivore interface,
              interactions at large scales, and evolutionary issues.  The "consequences of
              deploying transgenic herbivore-resistant plants" will be the topic of a special
              session.  A poster session in the middle of the conference is organized to
              facilitate participation by the scientific community at large, and especially
              students.  Formal sessions are scheduled in the mornings and evenings, allowing
              the afternoons as a time for informal meetings and discussions.  The conference
              likely will set the tone for the study of plant-herbivore interactions during
              the coming years of the 21st century.
