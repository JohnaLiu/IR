Fields
The goals of this project are to test the consistency between
              predictions of the primordial
abundances of cosmic baryons from the big bang
              nucleosynthesis (BBN) theory and the measurement of these abundances obtained
              from an analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations planned
              for the future satellite missions "MAP"(2002) and "PLANK." (2008). The work is
              divided into three phases, before, during, and after the release of the "MAP"
              results. In Phase 1 Fields will develop and hone the tools needed for this
              comparison, refining the Monte Carlo methods in current use by improving their
              treatment of the nuclear reaction uncertainties involved in the calculations.
              He will also improve the nuclear database used in the calculations, introducing
              a set of thermonuclear reaction rates and temperature-dependent errors in a
              user- friendly, publicly available form. In Phase 2, Fields will use the MAP
              determinations of the baryon density, to accurately compare the BBN and CMB
              measures of cosmic baryons, having developed the statistical tools to compare
              the results prior to the MAP mission. Finally in Phase 3 the MAP measurement of
              the baryon density will be used to remove the last free parameter from the BBN
              theory and permit its use as a probe of the early universe and basic nuclear
              physics by setting a limit on such parameters as the number  of light neutrino
              species as well as such astrophysically interesting quantities as the rate of
              Galactic evolution,  AGB star nucleosynthesis, dwarf galaxy evolution, and
              globular cluster ages and stellar rotation and evolution.

In addition,
              Fields will develop a new course in Astronomy for Teachers, designed for
              K-12
science and mathematics teachers, that will include both a survey of
              astronomy, and activities to bring this information to the classroom. 
              Initially held as a summer course on campus, it will eventually be offered in a
              distance learning format, and will use the Web as a resource for curricular
              material and activities developed by the teachers who take the course.
