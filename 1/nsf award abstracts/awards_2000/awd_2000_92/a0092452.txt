When
              moving around the environment, animals generate a pattern of visual
motion
              called optic flow.  Optic flow provides information about where and
how fast
              the observer is moving.  This information is crucial for safely
moving through
              the environment.  Despite its importance, very little is
known about how the
              ability to perceive optic flow develops early in life.
This project will
              examine how young infants develop the ability to
determine which direction
              they are moving or heading through the
environment.  It will examine the role
              that changes in visual factors, such
as acuity or sensitivity to motion, play
              in the ability to perceive one's
heading.  The project will examine how
              infants' emerging abilities to crawl
and walk shape their perceptual
              capacities.  The project also will examine
how infants develop the ability to
              use visual information to maintain
balance and control posture.  The results
              will provide new information
about the development of a perceptual skill that
              is critical for maintaining
balance, avoiding collisions, and moving safely
              through the environment.
In turn, the results will lay the groundwork for
              future research into the
impact of postnatal brain development on other
              aspects of perceptual and
motor development.  Finally, this CAREER project
              will incorporate educational
activities that will help to train a new
              generation of students in the
emerging field of developmental
