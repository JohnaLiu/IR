Abstract    :
              The purpose of the BIO AC workshop will be to provide advice that will help
              crystallize NSF's role in The Microbe Project.  The workshop will summarize the
              accomplishments, challenges, and opportunities in the microbial genomics field
              that are relevant to the NSF, provide some direct advice (such as criteria for
              selection of microbes that should be sequenced with NSF support), and also
              identify issues that should be addressed in greater detail in future workshops
              or other venues (e.g. informatics, standards for annotation, infrastructure
              needs, etc).  

The workshop will be held at the J. Erik Jonsson Center of
              the National Academy of Sciences in Woods Hole, MA from August 10 (all day)
              until noon on August 11, 2000.
