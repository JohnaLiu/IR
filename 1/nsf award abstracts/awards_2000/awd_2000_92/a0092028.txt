Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              Program, the Department of Chemistry at Arizona State University will acquire
              an instrument for ultrafast fluorescence and multipulse transient absorbance. 
              Research will focus on a) artificial photosynthesis, such as studies of
              biomimetic reaction centers coupled to artificial antenna systems; b) oxidative
              damage in DNA; c) redirecting electron transfer in photosynthetic reaction
              centers of purple nonsulfur bacteria; and d) ultrafast spectroscopic studies on
              photosynthetic pigments, antennas and reaction centers.  

Transient
              absorption spectroscopy is an extremely versatile tool that can be used to
              probe fundamental photophysical and photochemical processes.  These studies
              will have an impact in a number of areas, in particular biochemistry.
