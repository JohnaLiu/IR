Abstract    :
              This research focuses on devising practical methods for high-level design
              validation of microprocessors and supporting CAD tools based on explicit design
              error modeling, design error simulation, model-directed test generation, and
              design error correction. Specifically, the research concentrates on the
              following issues: (a) the development of a high-level design error simulation
              method based on a new high-level critical path tracing approach; (b) the
              establishment of high-level controllability and observability measures that can
              be used to guide the test generation for design errors; (c) the development of
              high-level test generation algorithm(s) that generate instructions to detect
              modeled and actual high-level design errors in microprocessors; (d) the
              development of high-level design error location, diagnosis, and correction
              methods that pinpoint the error location and suggest ways to correct it; and
              (e) the formation of a set of guidelines that facilitate design for validation
              and post-silicon validation.
