Abstract    :
              Prasad L. Polavarapu of Vanderbilt University has support from the Experimental
              Physical Chemistry Program to continue his spectral studies using vibrational
              circular dichroism.  During the three-year award period, he will undertake the
              following investigations:  a) the elucidation of guest-host interactions for
              molecules encapsulated in cyclodextrin cavities; b) the determination of
              absolute configuration of chiral suboxides; c) the determination of structural
              changes in peptides; d) the determination of the structure of bioactive
              peptides in membrane environments; e) the structural characterization of
              peptides that adopt b-hairpin structures; and f) the determination of
              conformations of chiral herbicides.  The principal investigator will also
              undertake ab initio theoretical calculations in order to fully analyze the
              experimental observations.  

These studies will advance knowledge and
              understanding in a number of fields:  chemical, biochemical and environmental. 
              The activities will not only advance scientific knowledge in these areas but
              also promote training, teaching and learning.  One of the more practical
              impacts of this work will be in the development and design of new herbicides
              with greater specificity and cost-effectiveness.
