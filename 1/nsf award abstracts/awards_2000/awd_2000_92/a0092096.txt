Abstract    :
              This award is for an exploratory operation to investigate the possibility of
              obtaining continuous ice cores from the Puruogangri ice cap on the Tibetan
              Plateau.  It is an international collaborative operation in which the Chinese
              will provide considerable logistical support, and the Ohio State group will
              supply their expertise and specialized ice-coring equipment.  If this
              exploratory operation is successful, it will lay the groundwork for obtaining
              the best ice-core record of climate and environmental history yet obtained from
              Tibet.
