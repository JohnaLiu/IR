F. Jaberi, Michigan State University

The PI proposes
              to study the following two areas: one is the development of Sub-Grid Scale
              (SGS) models for the implementation of the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of
              turbulent reacting flows, and secondly, the exploratory research on monitoring 
              indoor air quality and multiphase & multifluid transport.  In both areas of the
              research, the PI proposes to use the "filtered mass density function" (FMDF)
              developed by the PI for the closure methodology in LES application. He also
              plans to incorporate more realistic  chemical  kinetics in the turbulent
              combustion problem.  Advances in simulation of  turbulent combustion will
              result in improvements of combustion efficiency and better prediction of
              pollution production.  A better monitoring of indoor air quality will lead to a
               healthier living environment.
