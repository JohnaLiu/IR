Abstract    :
              This proposal addresses the applicability of high-speed communication networks
              to replace on-chip global and semi-global interconnects. Macrocells with the
              limited number of gates and wires are connected through the communication
              network. Limiting the number of gates per macrocell is shown experimentally to
              reduce the number of metal layers needed for circuit implementation.
              Additionally a basic research on 3-D interconnect standard cell design for
              predictability of interconnect related parameters is proposed. This is a
              combined educational and research effort. The goal is to overcome the
              limitations imposed by ultra-large scale integrated (ULSI) interconnects. Basic
              research is being conducted is in: (1) the applicability of high-speed on-chip
              communication networks to replace dedicated semi-global and global
              interconnects for use in microprocessor, ASIC, or SoC designs; (2) the
              incorporation of new 3-D interconnect standard cell design for capacitance and
              inductance predictability and hence timing, power, and area predictability; and
              (3) educational tools for grades 5-12 that promote student discovery in the
              problems and opportunities in present and future microprocessor design.
