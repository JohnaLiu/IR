              ABSTRACT


PI proposes  to study the Shared Mental Models of Teams, the
              knowledge structures that evolve over time as team members' individual mental
              models converge through interaction. Shared knowledge structures are seen as
              crucial for effective performance of project teams. This carefully phased study
              proposes, first, to establish a potential set of measurable constructs to guide
              later phases. Next, in Phase 2, to explore the preliminary conceptualization
              through interviews and observations to validate the conceptualization and
              investigate the notion of convergence. Phase 3 will develop and validate a
              shared mental model measurement instrument through a triangulation process of
              interview, archival and questionnaire data collected from industry partners'
              teams for comparison (250 subjects). Phase 4 will formulate further research
              hypotheses based on the earlier work, construct a questionnaire and pre-test
              it. Phase 5 will expand the questionnaire data collection and analyze the
              results (100 project teams). A diagnostic tool and associated intervention
              techniques will be created in Phase 6 based on research results. In the final
              phase, dissemination of results will take place through a seminar;
              presentations to participating organizations; scholarly and practitioner
              publications, and professional conference presentations.
