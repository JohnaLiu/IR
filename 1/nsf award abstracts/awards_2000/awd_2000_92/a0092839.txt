CAREER DESPOT: Enhanced
              Dynamic Process Management for Beowulf Clusters on the Grid

Current systems
              for managing workload on clusters of workstations, particularly those available
              for Linuxbased (Beowulf) cluster, are typically based on traditional
              process-based, coarse-grained parallel and distributed programming.  In
              addition, most systems do not address the need for dynamic process migration
              based on differing phases of computation.  As we have outlined in the proposal,
              the DESPOT project will first build a sophisticated thread-level
              resource-monitoring system for computational, and network resources.  This
              information will be used in an intelligent scheduling system to perform
              adaptive process/thread migration within the cluster.
