Abstract    :
              Many recent innovations in science education are designed to embed science
              learning into meaningful contexts.  These task-structured curricula are
              organized around specific projects, goals, or issues that cut across multiple
              content areas at varying levels of depth, unlike content-structured curricula
              that are organized around disciplinary topics.  The content covered in these
              new curricula has different properties when compared to content-structured
              curricula, which makes the description and measurement of learning difficult. 
              This project aims to develop theoretical frameworks and methodological
              strategies that can be used to characterize conceptual change in
              task-structured curricula.  The project will result in three outputs: (1) an
              assembly of theoretical frameworks and methodological strategies referred to as
              the Conceptual Dynamics program, (2) application of the program to analyze
              existing task-structured curricula, and (3) development of resources for
              teaching students in the learning sciences.
