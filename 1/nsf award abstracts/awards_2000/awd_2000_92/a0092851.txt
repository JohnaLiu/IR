The research and teaching efforts in this CAREER
              proposal will be directed towards examining fundamental activated sludge
              microbiology using novel molecular techniques. Specifically, the research will
              focus on the most important component of the most widely used wastewater
              treatment process: the separation of solids from the effluent in the activated
              sludge process.
This separation leads to the production of a clear effluent in
              activated sludge and depends on the intricate balance between the populations
              of filamentous and floc-forming bacteria. However, despite over 80 years of
              experience with the process, the main parameters affecting the microbial
              selection of floc-formers over filaments are not thoroughly understood.
              Consequently, methods
for controlling excessive filamentous growth that causes
              settleability problems (bulking) are empirical. A unified theory of microbial
              selection is thus necessary to provide a sound basis for designing control
              technologies  The research component of this project will combine molecular,
              modeling, and reactor studies to integrate theories of microbial selection of
              floc-formers over filaments and develop design guidelines for reactor design
              and operation. 
The education component involves the training of undergraduate
              and graduate students in the
principles and practices of molecular techniques,
              the integration of treatment process modeling
in graduate water quality
              courses, the development of a teaching module on applications of
molecular
              methods in environmental engineering, the integration of full-scale treatment
              plant
exposure experiences in undergraduate and graduate courses, and
              participation in the Video-
Based Engineering Education program at North
              Carolina State University. ***
