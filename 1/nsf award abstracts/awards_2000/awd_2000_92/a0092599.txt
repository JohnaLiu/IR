Leaves of higher plants are the primary photosynthetic
              structures and 
account for energy exchanges on a global scale and are
              responsible 
for plant survival.  While two types of leaves, simple and
              complex, 
can arise from any given shoot apex, the developmental and
              
evolutionary basis of these divergent leaf morphologies is not known. 
The
              phylogenetic relationships in higher plants suggest that complex 
leaves arose
              multiple independent times during the evolution of land 
plants.   Do simple
              and complex leaves differ at the level of some 
basic cascade of processes or
              are new genes and regulatory networks 
involved in generating each independent
              event of leaf complexity? 
The role of well-defined genes like the
              KNOTTED-Like HOMEOBOX Class 1 
genes (KNOX1), LFY. PHAN in the generation of
              leaf complexity needs 
to be defined.  Further, as yet unknown loci that
              regulate the 
process also need to be identified.  The proposed research will
              
utilize gene expression analyses in unrelated families with complex 
leaves,
              differential gene expression analyses in clonal individuals 
exhibiting
              contrasting leaf forms, and the cloning of factors that 
regulate leaf
              complexity in related species.  The goal of this 
research is to identify the
              genes that regulate leaf shape and form, 
and to help us understand how leaf
              form is developed to uniquely suit 
the photosynthetic function that leaves
              perform.
