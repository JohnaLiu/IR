Abstract    :
              Professor Shaowei Chen is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry
              CAREER program to study electron transfer through ordered films of monolayer
              protected nanoclusters.  Exchange reactions will be used to insert alkanethiols
              into the organic protective layers supported on gold particles. 
              Electrochemical studies of the electron transfer kinetics will be carried out,
              as well as spectroscopic studies.  The discrete electron-charging properties of
              monolayer protected nanoclusters will be studied, providing insight that might
              lead to applications as building blocks for single-electron transistors in
              nanocircuits.

The educational component of this award involves integrating
              nanoscale research into the undergraduate curriculum and undergraduate research
              programs.
