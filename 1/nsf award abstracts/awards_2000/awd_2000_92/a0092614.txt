Digital Government:  A
              Multinational Investigation of New Models of Collaboration for Delivering
              Government Services

The intention of this research is to enhance
              understanding of multi-organizational partnerships in the innovative delivery
              of government services.  Studies will include not only cross-sector
              partnerships, but also partnerships between government agencies.  Collaborating
              in the project's leadership is Canada's Centre Francophone d'Informatisation
              des Organisations; several other countries around the world are also
              participating in the study.

Questions to be addressed by the project
              include:

1. Which political, socio-economic and cultural factors promote
              successful interorganizational collaboration?
2. What are the characteristics
              of organizations that engage in such partnerships?
3. What are critical
              success factors?
4. Which technologies offer the most promise?
5. What are
              the advantages and disadvantages of different forms of collaboration?
