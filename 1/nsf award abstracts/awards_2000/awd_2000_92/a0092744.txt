This grant provides one fourth  support of the costs of
              acquiring digital data sets for nine deep seismic sounding (DSS) profiles from
              the Center GEON in Moscow.  The other 3/4 of the costs will be borne by the
              Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).  The Russian DSS data sets are a truly
              unique source of seismic data which image the upper mantle structure below a
              large fraction of the Eurasian continent.  These data sets are unique in that
              they were produced using well controlled and powerful seismic sources, i.e.
              peaceful nuclear explosions (PNE) equivalent in size to M > 5 earthquakes and
              chemical explosions.  Nine continental transects were produced using over 20
              PNEs and 300 chemical explosions recorded at over 200 sites.  These data
              contain structural information about the Earth's interior in the intermediate
              depth range (0-3200 km) between what can be learned from earthquake seismology
              and conventional controlled source seismology.  In addition, these are data
              sets that are likely never to be reproduced.  The data sets will be digitized
              and quality-controlled by Center GEON scientists in Moscow, transferred to
              University of Wyoming scientists for further QC, and finally reformatted and
              delivered to the IRIS Data Management Center where the data will be freely
              accessible to all interested academics scientists.  The project should be
              complete in four years.
