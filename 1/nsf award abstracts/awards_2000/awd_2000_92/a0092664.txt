Abstract    :
              The project focuses on integration of two learning paradigms for modeling
              stochastic visual patterns, and on developing a computational paradigm for
              effective stochastic inference. The work will strengthen the move from
              descriptive to generative models. Algorithms for learning and inference
              stronger than those existing today will be developed. A few order of magnitude
              improvement is expected for the mew methods. There is a good education program
              that includes improvement in the curriculum and design of new courses. Strong
              collaboration with industry and governmental labs will provide students with
              interesting experience.
