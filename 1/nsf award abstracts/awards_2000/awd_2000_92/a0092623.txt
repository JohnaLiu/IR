Title: A Regulatory Loop at the Neuromuscular
              Junction

Synapses are the nodes of communication between cells in the
              nervous system.  Their precise position and function enables us to perform
              tasks as simple as moving our limbs, and as complex as formulating new memories
              and ideas.  The neuromuscular junction, or synapse between a spinal cord motor
              neuron and a muscle cell, is by far one of the largest and simplest to study. 
              During development, proper synapse formation requires ongoing nerve-muscle
              electrical activity.  Without this activity, synapses fail to form properly. 
              The purpose of Dr. Loeb's project is to determine what are the molecular
              factors that regulate the formation of synapses and how normal synaptic
              activity orchestrates these factors.  Dr. Loeb's hypothesis is that regulatory
              factors are released both from the muscle cell and the neuron in response to
              the degree of electrical activity of the synapse and that these factors, in
              turn, have regulatory effects on each other that ultimately bring together
              necessary synaptic building blocks.  It will be studied how disrupting
              electrical activity of the synapse during synapse development modulates the
              production of two families of regulatory factors: the neuregulins, expressed in
              neurons, and the neurotrophins, expressed in muscle.  Dr. Loeb will also use a
              model system in the chick embryo that prevents the development of the limb on
              one side to see the effects of neurotrophic factors derived from that limb on
              the expression of neuregulins in neurons. From these studies, Dr. Loeb hopes to
              generate a unifying hypothesis of how synapses are formed and how this process
              is fine-tuned during development.
