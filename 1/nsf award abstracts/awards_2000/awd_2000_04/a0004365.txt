Abstract    :
              The investigators will study the role played by quasi-steady magnetotail
              reconnection in magnetospheric dynamics.  Time-of-flight effects can produce
              distinctive particle signatures during reconnection, when plasma is introduced
              onto previously unpopulated field lines.  Such indications of reconnection in
              the magnetotail are seen as velocity dispersed ion structures in data obtained
              by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program satellites in low Earth orbit. 
              There are three goals to the study.  The first goal is to learn what controls
              quasi-steady reconnection in the magnetotail.  The second goal is to examine
              the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling associated with velocity dispersed ion
              structures by characterizing their association with field-aligned currents. 
              The third goal is to ascertain any correlation with bursty bulk flows in the
              magnetotail.  The study will lead to a better understanding of how plasma
              enters the magnetosphere and how the entry process is manifested in ionospheric
              signatures.
