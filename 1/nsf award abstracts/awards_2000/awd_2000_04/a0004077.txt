	This award provides partial funding support for the
              development of a new, high-resolution, geochronological electron microprobe
              X-ray analyzer to be installed and operated in the Department of Geosciences at
              the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. The project involves development of
              new X-ray spectrometer systems, electron gun and column elements, new automated
              sample stage hardware, as well as new software for X-ray mapping and
              quantitative analysis aimed at improved trace element analytical precision and
              spatial resolution. The new instrumentation package will enable application of
              a new age-dating technique capable of resolving the complex thermochronology of
              metamorphic provinces. Development of the new electron microprobe will be a
              collaboration between the University of Massachusetts and a manufacturer of
              electron beam instruments, with both parties contributing cost sharing.
