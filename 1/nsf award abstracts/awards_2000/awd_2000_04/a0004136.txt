Abstract    :
              The last decade has seen an explosion in the introduction and use of interactive
              media. Yet, little is known about the impact of such media on child
              development. The American Psychological Association (APA), the National
              Communication Association (NCA), and the Society for Research on Child
              Development (SRCD) have developed a partnership to set a collaborative research
              agenda on the effects of interactive media on child development. This
              conference will bring together scholars, funders, policy-makers, and members of
              the press to hear about what is already known and to discuss future research
              needs.
