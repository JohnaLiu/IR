 The Seventh International Conference on Precipitation
              is being held in Rockport, Maine, June 30 - July 3, 2001.  Following the
              tradition of the previous six conferences, this meeting aims at fostering
              interdisciplinary interactions between atmospheric scientists, hydrologists,
              mathematicians, and statisticians.  The central theme of the conference will be
              research issues related to observations, estimation, and prediction of
              precipitation variability.  Particular emphasis is placed on the following
              topics:   (i)  application of modern observational techniques, including remote
              sensing, for precipitation estimation and prediction, (ii) dynamical modeling
              of clouds and precipitation, and (iii) limits of predictability
