Description:  This award supports a US-India cooperative
              research project on Aerosol Optical Characterization and Investigation of
              Aerosol Radiative Forcing at the Surface and Top of the Atmosphere.  The
              collaborators are Professor Rachel Pinker, University of Maryland and
              Professors G. Pandithurai and P.C.S. Devara, Indian Institute of Tropical
              Meteorology (IITM), Pune.  The effect of radiative forcing by anthropogenic
              aerosols is one of the largest sources of uncertainty in climate prediction,
              particularly for poorly understood tropical aerosols.  The PIs propose to add
              to the knowledge of aerosol optical characteristics through direct observation
              of the forcing at a tropical site.  A radiometer from the US PI's home
              institution for characterizing aerosol optical properties will be deployed in
              India to augment existing IITM instrumentation for both active and passive
              remote sensing of aerosols.   

Scope:  This research further enhances
              current collaborative efforts between the University of Maryland and the IITM
              on radiative effects of aerosols.  Dr. Pandithurai spent two years as a
              postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland and worked in the areas
              pertinent to this research.  The proposed activity will provide a coherent set
              of observations on aerosol optical properties, their vertical distribution, and
              their radiative effects.  It will     
also help extend the results obtained
              from the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) to other continental regions.  This
              award is jointly supported by the Division of International Programs and the
              Division of Atmospheric Sciences.
