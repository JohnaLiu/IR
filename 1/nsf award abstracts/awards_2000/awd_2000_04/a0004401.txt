Abstract    :
              This award supports a three-year Cooperative Agreement between the Barrow Arctic
              Science Consortium (BASC) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) that allows
              BASC to provide a variety of support services to the NSF's Office of Polar
              Programs.  These are:

1. Provide logistical support and coordination to NSF
              funded science projects working in the Barrow area.
2. Management of the
              Barrow Environmental Observatory, a 7,644 acre section of land just to the
              north-east of Barrow reserved for scientific studies.  BASC will also continue
              to recapture unpublished data associated with BEO and other North Slope and
              northern research.
3. Outreach and Education - providing strong links between
              the science community and the local community of the North Slope.
4. Work
              towards implementation of the recommendations of the report The Future of an
              Arctic Resource:  Recommendations from the Barrow Area Research Support
              Workshop (ARCUS 1999) to the degree that NSF accepts them.
5. developing a
              mechanism to provide improved logistical and permitting support for U.S.
              scientists working in Chukotka (Russia).

The agreement expires on 29 
              August, 2000
