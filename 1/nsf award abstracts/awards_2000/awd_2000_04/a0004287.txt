Abstract    :
              This project examines law's indeterminacy and the process of making and remaking
              law in the appellate courts, as seen in judicial decision-making in custody
              cases involving gay and lesbian parents. While there are records of such cases
              beginning in the 1950s, the explosion of homosexual parenting as both a legal
              issue and a site of public debate is most evident in the 1980s and 1990s. In
              deciding these cases, reliance on the "best interest of the child" standard is
              common if not universal; however, judges' determinations of what constitutes
              the "best interest" is anything but static. This project addresses three
              questions: 1) to what extent are judicial rationales and outcomes indeterminate
              in custody cases involving homosexual parents? 2) what are the specific
              discourses invoked in these rationales and decisions and how do they help to
              shape the meaning of the judicial decisions and legal rationales? and 3) what
              patterns of judicial language and legal meaning can be revealed over time in
              these decisions? Using archival data spanning a fifty-year time period, the
              project will investigate the patterns of reasoning and meaning-making apparent
              in judicial decisions in homosexual parents' custody cases.  More specifically,
              the project will examine discourses related to social movements, psychology and
              psychiatry, criminality, family structure, morality, and sexuality.  This
              project will shed light on the processes of legal change and
              institutionalization of meaning over time in the appellate courts.
