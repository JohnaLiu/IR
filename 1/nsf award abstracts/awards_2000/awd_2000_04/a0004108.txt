Abstract    :
              To provide student travel support to enable graduate students to attend the
              Integrated Photonics Research Topical Metting July 12-15, 2000, Quebec City,
              Canada.  This is a premier meeting for research in integrated and guided-wave
              photonics, which is a topic of considerable importance especially in the area
              of current fiber optical systems.  Most students attending this meeting present
              papers, and others attend for information.  In both cases, and to encourage
              student attendance at this and future IPR meetings, this application is to
              provide student travel grants, to some maximum value of $200 per student.
