This is a collaborative
              proposal between Principal Investigators at the Universities of  Rhode Island
              and Minnesota-Twin Cities.   The Arctic Ocean is much more dynamic than
              previously believed, characterized by large spatial and seasonal variations in
              productivity and associated particle flux, significant estuarine input and
              lateral intrusions of shelf water extending into the interior basins, and
              topographically-steered boundary currents along the perimeters of basins that
              result in regional extremes in water mass age.  The Principal Investigators
              hypothesize that "boundary scavenging", controlled by a combination of lateral
              advection and particle flux, plays a significant role in the removal of
              particle-reactive chemicals from the water column of the Arctic Ocean.  They
              will evaluate the role of boundary scavenging as it has an important bearing on
              such key geochemical processes such as the export of carbon to deep waters, the
              sediment accumulation of reactive chemicals, including contaminants, and the
              export of these chemicals to the Atlantic.  The objective is to constrain these
              fundamental processes on a basin-wide scale and to develop predictive
              biogeochemical models for this poorly understood and extreme environment. The
              Principal Investigators will determine whether that natural radionuclide
              Protactinium-231 (231Pa) - Thorium -230 (231Th) pair can be used as tracers to
              provide an integrated picture of water mass age and particle flux on a
              basin-wide scale in the modem and last glacial Arctic.

To provide an
              increased understanding of the processes that control the redistribution of
              these tracers in the Arctic Ocean, the Principal Investigators will undertake a
              comprehensive study that includes paired 231Pa - 231Th analyses in dissolved
              and particulate samples from the water column, sediment trap material, surface
              sediments and sediment comes.  This should help with a better understanding of
              the importance of particle composition on 231Pa - 231Th fractionation by
              quantifying the chemical composition of suspended particulate matter, sediment
              trap material and surface sediments.  Boundary scavenging should be pronounced
              in the Arctic, due to the combined effects of the high ratio of shelf to open
              ocean, the regional extremes in water mass age and particle flux, and a dynamic
              circulation.  This environmental setting is markedly different than other ocean
              regions where Pa and Th tracer studies have been conducted and provides a
              unique opportunity to investigate boundary scavenging and, in turn, constrain
              some outstanding questions regarding the paleo-application of 231Pa - 231Th.
