This grant provides partial support to the Department of
              Earth & Space Sciences at UCLA for the acquisition of a state-of-the-art
              electron microprobe (EMP) equipped with five wavelength dispersive
              spectrometers and capabilities for the analysis of light elements (Z < 9) and
              digital imaging of backscattered electrons.  The new EMP will replace the
              current but antiquated (vintage 1984) Camebax EMP that is beginning to show
              signs of instrument failure (i.e. stage positioning drift, frequent computer
              control crashes and failing vacuum pumps).  This state-of-the-art instrument
              will serve a large number of faculty including Craig Manning, Paul Warren,
              Frank Kyte, John Wasson, Mary Reid, Mark Harrison, Kevin McKeegan, Anne Yin and
              Alan Rubin for studies ranging from Himalayan tectonics to subduction zone
              metasomatism to chemical processes in the early solar system.  Support for this
              acquisition is shared roughly equally between NSF, NASA and UCLA.
