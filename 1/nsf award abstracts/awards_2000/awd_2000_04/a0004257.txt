Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to focus on enzymes of technical importance
              from two key organisms, Pyrococcus furiosus and Thermotoga maritima.  Both of
              these have been well characterized by the Principal Investigators and are
              suitable models for this project.  Basic and applied objectives are to be
              pursued.  The 
project is divided into five main areas.  Areas one to four
              focus on answering specific biochemical questions on four enzymes:  chitinases,
              glycosyl transferases, prolidases, and aminoacylases.  The fifth area addresses
              the optimization of the hyperthermophile gene expression in E. coli.
