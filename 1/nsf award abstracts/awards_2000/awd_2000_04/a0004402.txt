Abstract    :
              This project examines the cause of political and electoral violence in Mexico's
              democratization and the efficacy of the emergent strategies of legal control
              designed to diminish it. Over 600 opposition political party members have
              fallen as victims of political-electoral homicide between1988 and 2000. Many of
              these homicides occurred while an individual was engaged in legal activities,
              such as organizing political meetings, attending a post-election fraud protest,
              and conducting a "get out the vote" campaign. The project will test three
              hypotheses explaining the use of violence: 1) the "peasant-landlord conflict"
              thesis posits that violence against peasants is a manifestation of underlying
              agrarian struggles over land and wages; 2) the "violence as a political
              strategy" thesis asserts that political-electoral homicide is a response of the
              authorities to the violent tactics of a political party; and 3) the "lack of
              juridical uncertainty" thesis maintains that political-electoral homicide is
              the result of insufficient legal clarity surrounding election outcomes. The
              study will examine both qualitative data (biographical accounts of
              approximately 650 homicide victims) and quantitative data (survey data on the
              attitudes about political violence of 1,000 party members as well as
              prosecution rates for electoral crimes). The project's contributions include
              assessing the effectiveness of control over electoral crimes and linking
              violence with the study of the evolution of the rule of law and
              democratization.
