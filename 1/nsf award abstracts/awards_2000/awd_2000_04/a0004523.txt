Proposal Title: 	High-throughput Synthesis and Screening of
              Catalytic Materials for NOx

The objective of this proposal is to apply combinatorial catalysis
              to the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of the oxides of nitrogen (NOx) by
              hydrocarbons.  The proposed research entails the generation and screening of
              large libraries of supported catalyst materials for NOx SCR activity.  Initial
              compositions will be based on catalysts and supports known to have some amount
              of activity.  Catalyst testing will be conducted by placing the catalyst
              materials into wells of array channel microreactors over which simulated
              exhaust gases will be passed.  Each array microreactor system will allow the
              parallel testing of 80 different catalytic materials.  Screening will be
              accomplished by analyzing the reactor effluents using mass spectrometry or
              resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) spectroscopy.  Algorithms
              used in genetic research will be applied to this problem. This work will help
              develop the methodology for combinatorial catalysis coupled with an informatics
              approach for guiding optimization.  Application of the techniques to an
              important environmental problem will demonstrate their utility.
