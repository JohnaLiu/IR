This Doctoral
              Dissertation Improvement project examines spatial segregation in a
              post-socialist city.  The study will take place in Sofia, Bulgaria, which
              provides the opportunity to examine the issue within the contemporary process
              of transition towards a market economy and its related increasing social
              differentiation.  The investigators' prior research shows that Sofia resembles
              other former socialist capital cities in that there is a widening gap in urban
              inequality.  The PIs hypothesize that the economic and political changes that
              have occurred since 1989, together with the regional processes in Europe, are
              shaping an urban environment of sharper social polarization. This research will
              contribute to the literature on post-socialist cities in transition and allow
              us to better understand (1) how people make decisions about housing in a
              capitalist system as opposed to a communist one; and (2) how residential and
              mobility patterns correspond to household family structure, employment
              structure, education, ethnic background and income in a post-socialist
              system.
