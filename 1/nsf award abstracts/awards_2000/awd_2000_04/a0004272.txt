Abstract    :
              This is a planning grant to Independent Broadcasting Associates, Inc. to enable
              them to obtain and evaluate scientific data about the ecological condition of
              the Ganges river in South Asia in preparation for a series of documentaries for
              National Public Radio.  The series would combine both science and humanities to
              consider the meaning of the river in terms of the broad continuum of the Ganges
              ecosystem. 

During the planning stage, the PI will:

review published
              literature and determine whether relevant unpublished information is
              obtainable;
screen the obtainable information on the ecological condition of
              the Ganges/Padma river and identify major causes of the degradation of the
              river;  contact relevant government related bodies within India in order to
              locate suitable experts and written reports; establish relationships with and
              conduct interviews amongst relevant non-governmental parties including
              scientists, industrialists and agriculturalists in order to facilitate future
              interactions for the purpose of producing the series ; and  assess the
              suggestion that one of the problems with initiatives such as the Ganga Action
              Plan has been its reliance upon Western models -- both technological and
              conceptual -- which are often inappropriate to local conditions and
              realities.
