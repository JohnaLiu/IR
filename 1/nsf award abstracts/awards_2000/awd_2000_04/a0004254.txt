Abstract    :
              The Potomac Institute for Policy Studies will convene a conference in June 2000
              to address two broad questions of importance to US Armed Forces:  what
              opportunities do advances in science offer to US forces and how do scientific
              advances change the type of threats to US forces.  The workshop will bring
              together representatives of the military, Congress, and scientific communities
              to present their views of changes pertinent to these questions.  Specific areas
              addressed at the workshop include military perspectives on maneuver and power
              projection and protection, firepower and precision targeting, air warfare,
              space warfare, information and networking, and intelligence and threat
              assessment.  Science perspectives on topics such as energy, human factors and
              neuroscience, nanoscale technologies, information and knowledge, biomedical
              advances, and advanced materials will also be provided.  The workshop
              organizers will prepare a report that summarizes the presentations and
              conclusions.
