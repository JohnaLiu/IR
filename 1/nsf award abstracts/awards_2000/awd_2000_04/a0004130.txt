This grant provides partial support for the costs of
              acquiring a large sector gas-source mass spectrometer for the Isotope
              Geochemistry Lab at the University of Maryland.  The PI, James Farquhar
              recently joined the Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center and
              Department of Geology at the University of Maryland as an Assistant Professor. 
              The instrument will be the primary tool for Farquhar's research program in
              multiple isotope geochemistry of sulfur and oxygen (meant to imply measurement
              of 17O/16O in addition to 18O/16O, and  33S/32S and 36S/32S  in addition to
              34S/32S).  The information provided by a knowledge of isotope ratios involving
              these less abundant oxygen and sulfur isotopes allows us to gain important new
              insights into chemical and physical processes and provides the potential to
              address a whole new class of geological and biogeochemical questions.  The
              applications of the multiple isotope approach include the study of biological
              fractionation processes, the study of atmosphere-surface interactions, the
              study of the evolution of the atmosphere, studies of meteorites, and studies of
              crustal and mantle geochemistry.  The facility will complement present and
              planned research capabilities of the University of Maryland geochemistry group
              (Becker, Candela, Kaufman, McDaniel, McDonough, Morgan, Ondov, Prestegaard,
              Rudnick, Tomascak, Walker) and will be accessible to researchers at the
              University of Maryland and in the wider geological and geochemical community.
