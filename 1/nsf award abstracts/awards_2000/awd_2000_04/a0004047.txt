Abstract    :
              Summary:  This research will test the concept that leaf wax abundance in deep
              sea sediments and ice from Greenland represents a proxy for atmospheric dust
              and can be used to precisely synchronize climate records from ice cores and
              deep sea sediments.  This project will measure leaf wax abundance in sediments
              from the Bermuda Rise and Bahama Outer Ridge and in two ice cores from
              Greenland over the interval of ~ 39,000 to 36,000 years ago.  The objective
              will be determine if abrupt climate events believed to occur during this
              interval can be identified and correlated between the ice core and sediment
              records by changes in leaf wax abundance and isotopic proxies.
