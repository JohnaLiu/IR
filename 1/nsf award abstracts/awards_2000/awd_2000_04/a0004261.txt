Abstract    :
              The proposed project will perform and analyze uncoupled Atmospheric Model
              Intercomparison Project (AMIP-2) type integrations of the Climate Community
              Model (CCM) at T 42, T85 and T170 resolutions. The PIs will test if biases in
              simulated sea level pressure(SLP)  are caused by (i)  insufficient resolution
              of flow over orography, especially Greenland, (ii) insufficient resolution of
              transient circulations including surface effects on cyclogenesis and cyclone
              evolution in the storm tracks of high northern latitutes, (iii) poor simulation
              of clouds and atmospheric radiation due to model physics and (iv)
              over-simplification in the prescribed surface boundary conditions over sea ice.
              Improving GCM simulations of arctic surface winds and SLP is a prerequisite to
              obtaining useful coupled simulations of the arctic climate. The work is
              important because it will  provide  strong diagnostics underpinning to the CSM
              project from a university based group engaged in dynamical diagnosis of
              observed climate variability at high latitudes.
