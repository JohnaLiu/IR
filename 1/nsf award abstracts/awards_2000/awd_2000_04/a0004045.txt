This award to University of Alaska Fairbanks provides funds
              for a design study for an Alaskan Regional Research Vessel (ARRV).  The study
              will include Concept and Preliminary Design development, and will be carried
              out in collaboration with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  It is
              anticipated that the design developed under this award will have applications
              to both the ARRV, anticipated to replace R/V Alpha Helix, and to other
              intermediate vessel requirements in the UNOLS fleet.
