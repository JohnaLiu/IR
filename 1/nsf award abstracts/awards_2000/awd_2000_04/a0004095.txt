This grant provides partial support for the acquisition of
              a magnetic sector-based inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer
              (HR-ICP-MS) and an ultraviolet laser to be housed in the Geology Department at
              the University of Maryland, College Park.  Laser-assisted and solution-based
              ICP-MS analysis will aid the research of the PI's and numerous other
              departmental faculty in studies of the geochemical evolution of the crust and
              mantle, cosmochemical research, U-Pb geochronology of accessory phases,
              carbonate petrology, experimental petrology and the biogeochemistry of surface
              and groundwaters.  This instrument will complement existing geochemical
              instrumentation in the department including stable isotope ratio mass
              spectrometers, thermal ionization mass spectrometers, a multi-collector ICP-MS,
              and electron beam instrumentation.  The critical mass of faculty trained in
              geochemistry (many newly appointed) and the arsenal of state-of-the-art
              geochemical instrumentation leave UMD-CP well poised to be leaders in both
              research and the training of undergraduate and graduate students in the
              geological sciences for many years to come.
