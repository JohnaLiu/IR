Abstract    :
              This study will document the development and impact of an after-school program
              for elementary students in school district in California.  This after-school
              program will also serve as a pedagogical laboratory and
professional
              development site for new teachers.  The specific goals of the study are
              two-fold: 1) to document and examine the processes of learning among children
              who are enrolled in the after-school pedagogical
laboratory and 2)to document
              and analyze the process of teachers learning to teach in the pedagogical
              laboratory.  Consequently, this study will directly and simultaneously address
              the underachievement of
African American students and other students of color
              and the preparation of their teachers.
