Abstract    :
              	Three-dimensional model simulations will be performed of storms during STERAO-A
              (Stratosphere-Troposphere Experiments: Radiation, Aerosols, and Ozone, 1996).
              The objectives of this field project were to examine trace gas transport,
              lightning production of nitrogen oxides (NOx), and photochemistry in convective
              storms. Events from the EULINOX (European Lightning NOx) project will also be
              simulated.  
	The Goddard Cumulus Ensemble (GCE) model will be modified to
              allow nonuniform initial conditions and consideration of terrain. A 3-D
              cloud-scale chemical transport model will be constructed, to be driven by data
              fields generated by the 3-D cloud model. The CTM will include an advection
              scheme, a photochemistry solver and mechanism, a cloud-perturbed photolysis
              scheme, a lightning NOx parameterization algorithm, and a wet scavenging
              scheme. The characteristics of the observed cloud dynamics and microphysics
              will be replicated as closely as possible using the 3-D GCE model. Simulations
              will be conducted of the convective redistribution of trace gases within the
              thunderstorms. For lightning NOx, the approach observed flash rates and
              locations in the model will be used. The goal of the lightning analysis will be
              to better determine the amounts of NO produced per flash. 
	This project is a
              collaboration with Kenneth Pickering, University of Maryland, College Park,
              ATM-9912336.
