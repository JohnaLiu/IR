Rudnick

This grant provides two years of partial salary support for
              a technician to work in the ICP-MS lab in the Department of Geology, University
              of Maryland.  This is a Phase II technician support award under the
              Instrumentation and Facilities program and follows three years of Phase I
              support (EAR- 9711008) that was awarded when the PI's were at Harvard
              University. The PI's Rudnick and McDonough recently joined the faculty at
              Maryland (8/2000) after a long stint at Harvard University where they, together
              with technician Dr. Ingo Horn, were responsible for much of the early
              development of laser-based ICP-MS trace element analyses of geological
              materials.   Since arrival at the University, the PI's have also been
              successful in garnering NSF funds for a new magnetic sector ICP-MS and UV laser
              for in situ trace element and isotopic analyses of deep crustal and mantle
              rocks and phases.  Continued support of an ICP-MS  technician for this team at
              the University of Maryland will also serve a large and active faculty and a
              strong graduate and undergraduate program in the geosciences for research in
              igneous, metamorphic and carbonate petrology, surface and groundwater
              geochemistry, economic geology, experimental petrology, and radiogenic isotope
              geochemistry.  The University has committed to full support of this position
              for a minimum of two years beyond expiration of this grant.
