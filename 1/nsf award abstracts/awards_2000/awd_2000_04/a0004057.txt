Abstract    :
              DGE-00-04057

This project represents the continuation of the activities, I
              began as a PFSMETE Fellow at Northwestern University. The project has three
              components: 1) continued curricular materials development, testing, and
              refinement for geography and environmental science education; 2) developing new
              tools and materials to facilitate hands-on, inquiry-based learning in the
              geosciences; and to promote and facilitate the pedagogical use of
              computer-based geographic visualization and analysis tools at the undergraduate
              level.
