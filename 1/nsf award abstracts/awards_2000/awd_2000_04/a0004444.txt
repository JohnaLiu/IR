Abstract    :
              This grant supports the deployment of a fast-response, airborne instrument for
              measuring the concentration of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) during the DYCOMS-II
              project in July 2001 (Dynamics and Chemistry of Marine Stratocumulus).  DMS is
              an atmospheric trace gas which is an effective indicator of mixing between the
              marine boundary layer and the free atmosphere.  Its main source is the ocean
              surface and its lifetime in the atmosphere is about one day.  It therefore has
              relatively high concentration in the boundary layer and low concentration in
              the free atmosphere.  Fluctuations in the concentration at the top of the
              boundary are an indication of the strength of mixing and the rate of mass
              transfer between the boundary layer and the air above.  The instrument is a
              fast-response ionization mass spectrometer capable of yielding data with a time
              resolution of 50 ms.  In combination with other aircraft instruments that
              measure temperature, vertical air velocity, humidity, cloud droplet
              concentration and sizes, and aerosol sizes and composition, it will provide
              information on entrainment processes at cloud top.  The data will be used in
              the testing and evaluation of large eddy simulations of mixing in marine
              stratocumulus clouds.
