Abstract    :
              The research investigates how human infants represent numerical concepts and the
              relationship between learning to count verbally and pre-linguistic number
              representations.  Specifically, the objective is to determine if there are two
              representations of number in infants, one for small numbers (1, 2, 3, and
              perhaps 4) and one for large numbers (numbers larger than 3 or 4). 
              Furthermore, we take the first step in investigating how learning the integer
              list of English (i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.) may change children's later
              numerical concepts.  Previous studies on number representations in infants and
              preschool children have shown that there may be a major developmental change in
              infants' number representations when they have acquired the meaning of the
              number words at around 3 to 3.5 years of age.  Young infants may begin with two
              systems of number representations, one for small number (1, 2, and 3) and one
              for large numbers (e.g., 8, 16, etc.).  The proposed study tests the hypothesis
              these two representations are distinct and that verbal counting allows the
              child to combine these two representations to yield adult-like numerical
              representations.  In other words, because the verbal counting list (1, 2, 3,
              etc.) imposes certain constraints on conceptual representations, the child has
              to use both the small number and the large number representations in order to
              make sense of the counting list.  These hypotheses will be investigated with
              several methods, including a violation of expectancy looking time method with
              infants, a training-then-transfer method with toddlers, and the how-many and
              give-a-number tasks widely used in assessing children's understanding of number
              words.  The results of these experiments should lead to a more detailed and
              deeper understanding of the relationship between pre-linguistic representations
              of number and children's learning to count.  The proposed research will shed
              basic light on the relationship between language and cognition in the domain of
              number representations.
