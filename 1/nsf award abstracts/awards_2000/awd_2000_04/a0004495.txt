Abstract    :
              This is funding to subsidize expenses of student participants in a special
              poster session the PIs are organizing as part of the 18th annual International
              Conference on Machine Learning (ICML'2001), which will be held June 28-July 1
              in Williamstown, MA  (the PIs are the Program Co-Chairs of the conference).
              This is the premier conference for machine learning research.  The PIs' goals
              are to integrate students into their research sub-communities and to give them
              a forum to talk to the leading researchers in the field about their PhD
              research.  To this end, a poster session will be organized on one of the first
              nights of the conference where each sponsored student will have a poster.   To
              ensure sufficient traffic, the PIs will require each program committee member
              to sign up ahead of time on the Web to see at least 5 posters that evening, on
              the basis of the students' abstracts.  The students will also get a one page
              abstract submission to the conference proceedings.   The PIs feel this plan has
              benefits over the more traditional PhD workshops organized by other
              conferences, as detailed in the proposal.  The PIs will choose among the
              applicants for the scholarships, on the basis of a submitted abstract and vita
              plus a letter of recommendation from the student's advisor.   They expect to
              make 30-40 awards of approximately $500 apiece.  The mentoring work will be
              distributed among the members of the program committee.   The poster session
              will provide students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives on their
              work at a critical time in their research.  This is an inexpensive yet highly
              effective means of encouraging young and upcoming researchers in machine
              learning.
