Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Michigan State University, Percy A. Pierre,
              Principal Investigator, for the support of a project entitled, "Planning a
              Program to Enhance the Infrastructure of NSF's ERC's to Graduate More U.S.
              Students--Especially Women and Minorities."  This planning grant will provide

              engineering workforce for research and development by strengthening the
              infrastructure of the NSF ERC's to significantly increase the number of
              domestic engineering graduates--especially women and underrepresented
              minorities.
