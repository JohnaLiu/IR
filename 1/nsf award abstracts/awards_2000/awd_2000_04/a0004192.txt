Abstract    :
              The American Statistical Association will administer a research program under
              this grant with the objective of fostering collaborative and interdisciplinary
              research efforts that will continue to stimulate the development and
              advancement of the methodology and research relevant to a wide range of
              statistical 
programs.  The results of research conducted under the
              ASA/SRS-NSF Research Program will be made available to the scientific community
              through articles that the researchers will submit to scientific journals;
              papers prepared for the ASA and other professional society meetings that may be
              published in proceedings; and papers and other publications that agencies
              disseminate in working papers, statistical notes, or technical report
              series.

The ASA/SRS-NSF Research Program will benefit the academic
              researchers who participate and the larger scientific and statistical
              communities.  The researchers will benefit from the opportunity to work on
              important problems in a non-academic setting and exposure to the environment of
              Federal statistical agencies.  The larger scientific and statistical
              communities will be enriched by the addition to scientific knowledge that
              results from the research conducted under the auspices of the program.
