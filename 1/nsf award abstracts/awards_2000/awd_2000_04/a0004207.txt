Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to investigate the influence of stratospheric
              quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) on regional convection and precipitation in
              the tropics, including hurricane genesis. The PI and his collaborators will
              analyze various data sets (Outgoing Longwave Radiation, Highly Reflective
              Cloud, and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and
              European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) reanalysis data
              sets) to document the QBO impact on tropical upper-tropospheric wind,
              temperature, and radiation fields. The impacts will be determined using several
              techniques, including straightforward compositing of fields during the easterly
              and westerly QBO phases. Since QBO is a fairly regular low-frequency
              oscillation, its impact on tropopause environment is potentially predictable.
              Dr. Hitchman argues that the QBO impacts are also significant, and that the
              project will advance long-range forecasting of tropical climate.
