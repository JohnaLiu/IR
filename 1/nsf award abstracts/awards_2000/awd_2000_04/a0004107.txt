Abstract    :
              The planning project, "Is Global Warming Just a Lot of Hot Air?," is a
              consortium of twenty (20) research institutions, science centers and
              environmental organizations which will plan exhibits and outreach programs to
              address climate change and its affect on communities and ecosystems of northern
              New England.  Research scientists will work with informal science educators to
              develop innovative approaches to presenting what is known about climate
              change.

The planning project will investigate strategies for helping the
              1.85 million visitors in the region understand the issues in relation to the
              landscape and social environment.  There is a wide-ranging group of advisors
              drawn from science, research, classrooms and informal learning centers to guide
              the 18-month planning project.
