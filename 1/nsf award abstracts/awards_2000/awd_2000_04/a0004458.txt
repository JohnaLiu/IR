Description:  This award supports the International
              Workshop on Space Weather Effects on Communications and Navigation Signals,
              Boston, Massachusetts, June 7-8, 2001.  The principal organizer is Professor
              Cesar Valladares of Boston College.  The two-day workshop, which immediately
              follows the International Beacon Satellite Symposium of the International Union
              of Radio Scientists (URSI), will promote discussion among researchers from the
              United States, Canada, Europe, South America, China, Taiwan, India, and Africa.
               The prime topic for discussion is the ionospheric effects on space-based
              communication and navigation systems.  Following the plenary presentations,
              workshop and poster sessions will provide the opportunity to exchange
              information on worldwide and regional ionospheric problems and on current
              research activities aimed to assess and understand ionospheric effects on
              space-based systems.

Scope:  The Global Positioning System (GPS), which
              originally was developed by the Department of Defense as a military system, has
              become a global utility.  Conversion of the GPS has resulted in dramatic
              improvement in its accuracy for civilian users worldwide.  Applications include
              air, road, marine, and rail navigation, telecommunications, emergency response,
              oil exploration, mining, and many more.  The workshop will provide a forum for
              the exchange of knowledge developed in the United States and Europe on
              utilizing the GPS for space-based navigation and communication systems. 
              Likewise, colleagues from various equatorial countries will be able to share
              their knowledge of local ionospheric conditions and current research
              activities.  The workshop offers a unique opportunity for international
              colleagues to develop a research agenda for understanding ionospheric effects
              on space-based systems.  This award is jointly supported by the Division of
              International Programs and the Division of Atmospheric Sciences
