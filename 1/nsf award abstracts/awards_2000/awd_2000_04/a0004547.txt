This is a three-year cooperative project between Dr. Dashan
              Shen, the University of Alabama and Professor Yu Yuehui, the Shanghai Institute
              of Metallurgy, Chinese Academy Science, to study novel Silicon-On-Insulator
              substrates using Amorphous Aluminum Nitride and Amorphous Diamond as Insulating
              Layers. This project will experiment using Amorphous Aluminum Nitride and
              Amorphous Diamond as an insulating layer on Silicon-on-insulator substrates to
              improve the thermal conductivity of integrated circuits (IC).  This is
              important research in high power IC applications.  Success in developing this
              technology can overcome the self-heating effect of the circuit due to the poor
              thermal conductivity and heat diffusion of the insulating layer.  This proposal
              also provides an opportunity for a U.S. graduate student from an EPSCoR
              institute to work with one of the best Chinese research institutes in
              metallurgy.  This proposal addresses an important scientific question and meets
              the NSF objective of human resource development. The Chinese Academy of Science
              and the NSF jointly support this project.
