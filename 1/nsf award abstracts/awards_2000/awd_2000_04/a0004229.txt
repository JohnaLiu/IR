Abstract    :
              This project is examining the impact of information technology on the
              educational enterprise, and considering how the needs of the educational
              enterprise may inform new IT research. The project addresses the use of
              information technology to enable new forms of student learning assessment tools
              and new forms of delivery of those tools. The work will be performed by a team
              of undergraduate students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, working at the
              NSF offices following a course in research methods and proposal writing at
              their home institution. At the conclusion of the project, the students will
              defend their work in a formal oral presentation to NSF personnel, WPI faculty
              and other representatives of the university. In addition, the students will
              deliver a completed final report to NSF, containing a literature review and
              methodology, a presentation of data with data analysis, conclusions, and
              recommendations.
