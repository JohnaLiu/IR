Abstract    :
              The insect neurohormone bursicon is essential for formation of the insect
hard
              outer cuticle.  Although discovered in 1935, bursicon and its action
have
              remained poorly understood. The primary aim of this collaborative project is
              the
characterization of the gene sequence coding for this ubiquitous
              insect
neurohormone. Degenerate primers derived from several partial amino
              acid
sequences of cockroach bursicon will be used to amplify bursicon cDNA
              from
messenger RNA by reverse transcription and PCR. In addition, existing
              cDNA
libraries from other insects will be used for screening with probes
              derived
from PCR.  Knowledge of the full sequence of bursicon will
              facilitate
identification of the bursicon active site and its
              receptor.
Because insects 'wear' their skeletons on the outside, they
              must
periodically shed them as they grow or metamorphose.  During each
              molt
cycle, new cuticle must be synthesized.  The hormone bursicon, triggers
              the
hardening of the new cuticle once the old cuticle has been shed. 
              Cuticular
hardening provides not only protection, but also a framework for
              muscle
attachment enabling locomotion.  Clearly, interference with
              bursicon
release or its actions will result in the death of the animal. 
              This
investigation will provide a basis for new methods of biological
              pest
management by disrupting the function of bursicon.
