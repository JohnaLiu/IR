Abstract    :
              The hypothesis of this research is that anthropogenic aerosols increase the
              concentration of cloud droplets but decrease their average size, thus reducing
              the snowfall rate by decreasing the efficiency with which falling ice crystals
              sweep out the supercooled droplets.  The approach is to monitor the chemical
              and physical properties of clouds and aerosols and the snowfall rate at the
              Storm Peak Observatory, a laboratory operated by the Desert Research Institute
              at an elevation of 3210 meters near Steamboat Springs, Colorado.  At this
              altitude, the Observatory is frequently above cloud base during snow.  The
              measured quantities include the size distributions of cloud droplets, ice
              crystals, and aerosol particles, the chemical composition of cloud water and
              snow, and the snowfall rate.  A radar wind profiler and balloon sounding system
              complement the measurements at the ground by providing vertical profiles of
              wind, temperature, humidity, radar reflectivity, and Doppler spectra.  This
              work has significant economic and demographic implications. If pollution
              aerosols are significantly reducing snowfall rates, this will decrease the
              amount of water available from snow pack, which in the West is an important
              source.
