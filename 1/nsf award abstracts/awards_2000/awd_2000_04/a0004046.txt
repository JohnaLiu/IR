Abstract    :
              Lawrence Berkeley National laboratory (LBNL) will host a workshop to promote the
              formation of research partnerships between faculty at colleges and university
              in designated EPSCoR states and the scientific staff from DOE national
              laboratories and facilities.  The date will be August 16-17, 2000 in the San
              Francisco Bay Area, near LBNL.  Attendance will include up to 200 researchers
              from the 20 EPSCoR jurisdictions and the Department of Energy (DOE) National
              Laboratories.
The primary objective of the meeting is to provide a forum for
              research scientists from the EPSCoR states to:  1) report advances in EPSCoR
              funded research activities; 2) update their knowledge of DOE programs and
              initiatives; 3) learn about LBNL National User Facilities and research
              directions; 4) explore opportunities for research with DOE scientists; 5)
              develop plans for future research projects; and 6) learn about DOE laboratory
              opportunities for training and hands-on research experience for undergraduate,
              graduate, postdoctoral fellows and new faculty.
The workshop  will be
              sponsored by the DOE, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences EPSCoR
              program and co-sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) EPSCoR
              Office.
Project leaders and participants in both DOE and NSF EPSCoR are
              invited to attend and provide technical poster presentations.  Workshop
              participants are requested to submit an abstract of their research activities
              and/or updates on their particular program.
