Abstract    :
              The ability to perform machining operations in a comprehensive simulation
              environment and to obtain realistic predictions of its outcome in terms of
              workpiece attributes (dimensional tolerance, form, and surface finish) and
              process capabflities is the vision motivating this proposal.  An initial
              framework for the realization of this capability, epitomized by the designation
              Virtual Machine Tool (VMT), will be defined.  The envisioned VMT environment
              will ultimately allow machine tool builders to evaluate alternative machine
              designs and configurations, and will assist machine tool users to predict the
              achievable workpiece attributes during planning, selection, and use of' metal
              cutting machine tools. The underlying assumptions, interrelation between the
              necessary functions, and the envisioned methods and approaches to the
              computational simulation of the functional elements of the VMT will be
              addressed. The principal emphasis will be on fundamental issues related to the
              integration of machine and process related funttions, and on the development of
              predictive models for workpiece attributes and process capability measures that
              are essential missing ingredients of the VMT concept. The outcome, consisting
              of prototype code for the characterization, visualization, and mapping of
              workpiece attribute deviations from the nominal, will be experimentally
              verified on the example of end milling, drilling, and tapping operations.
