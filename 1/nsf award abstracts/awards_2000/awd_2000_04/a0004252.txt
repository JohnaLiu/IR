Abstract    :
              The UC-AGEP, comprised of all nine UC System campuses, is working in partnership
              with federal and state sponsored preparation programs for underrepresented
              minorities in SMET.  The programs that are formally linked to the UC-AGEP
              include: LSAMP, MESA-MEP, Ronald McNair Scholars, MARC, MBRS, and UCLEADS. 
              Additionally, each UC campus has developed links to undergraduate institutions
              that graduate large numbers of minority students with bachelor's degrees in
              SMET.

In this proposal, the UC Office of the President assumes
              responsibility for routine coordination, data management, and communication
              with NSF regarding funding and reporting requirements.  To facilitate
              communication and collaboration among the campuses, two working groups (one in
              Northern California and one in Southern California) have been formed, and will
              meet at least twice each year.
