Abstract    :
              This research investigates the macroeconomic and welfare implications of  
              social security reform in models with aggregate shocks. It is motivated by the
              observation that the great depression in the U.S. led to an introduction of an
              unfunded social security system, yet the role of an unfunded social security
              system for the allocation of intergenerational aggregate risk are not well
              understood theoretically or quantitatively.

A primary goal of this research
              is to quantitatively evaluate the aggregate economic and welfare effects of a
              social security reform from a pay-as-you-go to a fully funded system within an
              overlapping generations model with stochastic production, idiosyncratic
              uncertainty, and a  large number of generations. Given the current debates
              about reform of the social security system, another goal of this research is to
              inform policy makers about the trade-offs involved in moving from an unfunded
              to a funded system of social security in the presence of aggregate economic
              fluctuations.
