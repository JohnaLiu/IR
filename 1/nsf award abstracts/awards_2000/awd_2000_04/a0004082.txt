This grant provides three years of continued partial support
              for the operation and maintenance of the University of Texas Computed X-ray
              Tomography (CT) Facility as a national multi-user facility for the geosciences
              and ancillary fields.  This facility has been supported for the last two-years
              by the IF program (EAR-9816020) to allow geoscientists subsidized access to the
              capabilities of CT for non-destructive imaging of the interiors of geological
              samples.  Continued support will foster further use of the CT scanner at UT for
              investigations in a multitude of sub-fields of the geosciences including,
              vertebrate paleontology, igneous and metamorphic petrology, volcanology,
              sedimentology and stratigraphy.  High resolution CT imagery will aid our
              understanding of, the physiology and evolution of both mammalian and
              non-mammalian species, crystallization processes in metamorphic environments,
              the paleoelevation of ancient eruptions, subsurface fluid flow, and basic
              materials properties.  In many cases, CT imagery offers unprecedented 3-D views
              of geologic structures and skeletal remains that otherwise would have remained
              obscured to human observation.
