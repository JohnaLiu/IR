The objective of this project is to understand the surface reactions
              involved in the growth, doping, and passivation of indium phosphide (InP),
              indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs), and indium gallium arsenide nitride (InGaAsN)
              by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).  The research combines
              experimental studies of the surface structure using scanning tunneling
              microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, reflectance-difference spectroscopy, and
              x-ray photoemission spectroscopy with ab initio quantum chemistry calculations
              to provide insights into the surface processes that control MOCVD growth.  The
              research plan encompasses a study of three different topics: the decomposition
              reactions of group V sources on InP, the surface chemistry of intentional
              dopants, and the surface passivation by organic monolayers.  The surface
              reaction chemistry of phosphine, arsine, ammonia, dimethylhydrazine, silane,
              tetrasilylmethane, and cyclopentene on InP will be determined.  To help
              identify adsorbed species, infrared bands will be compared with results from
              quantum chemistry calculations.  The work has application in the fabrication of
              heterojunction bipolar transistors used in wireless and optical communications
              systems.
