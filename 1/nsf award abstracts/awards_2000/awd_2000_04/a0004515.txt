Abstract    :
              Abstract:
The main objective of the proposed research is to develop
              novel
Software-Implemented Fault Tolerance (SIFT) techniques for
              increasing
the dependability of the distributed and networked environments
              based on
COTS.
The issues of dependability will be addressed by the design
              and
implementation of (SIFT), dynamic reconfiguration in distributed
              systems
and high-speed computer networks. Novel fast dynamic
              reconfiguration
techniques for various irregular network topologies will be
              developed and
analyzed. An analytical method is proposed for evaluating the
              reliability
improvement by using  SIFT for any size of distributed systems
              .
The  goal of this research  is to identify and develop new key
              building
blocks
for reliable distributed systems built with inexpensive
              off-the shelf
components. The platform consists of computing nodes connected
              via
multiple interfaces to networks configured in fault-tolerant
              topologies.
Thus, the research community and a large number of users will have
              the
opportunity  to build reliable distributed systems based on COTS in a
              user
transparent way.The goal will be to achieve a high reconfiguration
              rate
and a small recomputation overhead in the presence of faults in
              the
distributed
systems and high-speed computer networks in a way transparent
              to the user,
which will provide a high dependability.
This research project
              will have a positive impact on a large community
implementing applications in
              distributed and network environments such as
: e-commerce, telepresence,
              telemedicine, Internet data centers,
distributed applications running
              concurrently across
