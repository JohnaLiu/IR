The origin of large mountain belts
              like the Andes at ocean-continent convergent margins remains enigmatic despite
              centuries of study beginning with Darwin. Various hypotheses have been advanced
              to explain the Andes, but by themselves none seem capable of explaining the
              formation of this vast region of elevated, thickened crust. For example, the
              investigator's preliminary GPS data suggest that the Andes are growing today at
              roughly their long term average rate despite significant slowing of subduction
              since the Miocene, problematic for models that call on fast subduction alone to
              form the Andes. This collaborative team from the University of Miami and
              Northwestern University proposes a series of GPS measurements that exploit a
              network first occupied in 1994, coupled with related seismic studies, aimed at
              understanding the processes forming Andean mountain belts. They will focus on
              the Central Andes of Peru and Bolivia, where the high, wide Altiplano plateau
              is best developed, and where an active fold and thrust belt accommodates rapid
              crustal shortening. To enhance their ability to discriminate models and to
              conserve resources, the measurements will be densified in two transects that
              cross the entire plate boundary zone, in regions of flat and normal subduction.
              The new measurements will span a total of four years to obtain velocity
              accuracy at the new sites adequate to distinguish among several competing
              hypotheses.
