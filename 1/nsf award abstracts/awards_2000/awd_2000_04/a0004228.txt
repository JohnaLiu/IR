Abstract    :
              Dissemination and assessment opportunities are established for current and
              potential NSF grantees in CCLI, CRCD, ATE, and Action Agenda programs at the
              2001 and 2002 ASEE Annual Conferences. Events include a poster session and two
              NSF Showcases at each conference for grantees in each of the four programs.
              Selected presentations are published in the conference proceedings. Impact of
              this dissemination on promoting awareness of NSF programs and on stimulating
              new proposal submittals are assessed through a series of surveys directed at
              both presenters and attendees.
