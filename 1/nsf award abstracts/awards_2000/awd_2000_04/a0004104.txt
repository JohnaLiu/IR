This grant will provide three years partial salary support for
              a laboratory technician in the stable isotope laboratory at the University of
              Tennessee-Knoxville. This is a Phase I technician support grant under the
              Instrumentation and Facilities (IF) Program. The stable isotope technician will
              provide routine maintenance and operation of the isotope ratio mass
              spectrometers and vacuum extraction lines, help to develop and maintain proper
              analytical technique, and provide quality instruction to laboratory users,
              including undergraduate and graduate students and researchers from other
              universities. Support of this technician will permit more active research
              engagement of the P.I. and other UTK faculty in their research on soils and
              paleosols, plant-soil interaction, Precambrian carbonates, fluid-rock
              interaction, and bat ecology, enhancing research and educational activities
              within the geological sciences and across several disciplines. This will
              ultimately broaden the base of operational support for the lab and increase the
              institutional value of a permanent, state (i.e., University)-funded position in
              the lab.
