Abstract    :
              This is a planning grant to Timothy Ferris to develop a PBS documentary film
              about amateur astronomy and stargazing.  The film will bring viewers into
              direct contact with the night sky, introducing them to the constellations and
              showing how even a small telescope can open a window onto the cosmos.

Ferris
              has previously produced two highly regarded science documentaries, "The
              Creation of the Universe" and "Life Beyond Earth."  The director for the
              "Seeing In the Dark" program will be Thomas Levenson who most recently served
              as producer/director/writer for the "Dome" program in Building Big.  Andrew
              Fraknoi, Chair of the Astronomy Department at Foothill College and Educational
              consultant for the Astronomical Society of the Pacific will be the Science and
              Outreach Consultant for the project. 

Activities during the planning stage
              include:

Developing preliminary storyboarding, determining locations and
              people to appear in the film and working out special effects
              sequences
Acquiring and digitizing images for use in the film
Planning
              educational and public outreach efforts
Identifying and consulting with
              potential creative contributors to the film
Shooting and editing a test night
              scene at a "star party" to establish which techniques can produce the best
              results in these conditions.
