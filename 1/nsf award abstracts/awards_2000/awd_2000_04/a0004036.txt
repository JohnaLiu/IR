The 3rd
              International Symposium on Environmental Hydraulics with a special theme in
              urban fluid dynamics will be held in Tempe, Arizona in December 2001with Dr.
              Boyer as the Chairperson. The overall theme of the Symposium is the application
              of basic research to address issues facing policy makers in the management of
              air and water resources. Several invited speakers will evaluate the present
              state of knowledge.  A number of oral and poster sessions in environmental
              hydraulics and in urban fluid dynamics have been planned and the session Chairs
              have been assigned.   It will provide researchers in this field an excellent
              opportunity for open exchange of ideas.
