Description: This award is for support of a cooperative
              project by Professor Vladimir Lifschitz, Department of Computer Science, the
              University of Texas, Austin, Texas, Drs. Ferda Nur Alpaslan and Ismail Hakki
              Totoslu, Computer Engineering Department, Middle East Technical University,
              Ankara, Turkey, and Dr. Varol Akman, Department of Computer Engineering,
              Bilkent University, Ankara Turkey.  These scientists plan to study the
              application of artificial intelligence to workflow management.  Action
              languages are formal models of parts of natural language that are used for
              talking about the effects of actions.  The Causal Calculator is a software
              system that allows the user to automate planning and reasoning about actions in
              domains described in an expressive action language called C.  The scientists
              plan to develop a translation tool that will translate from a workflow
              specification language into Action Language, C.  This will allow permit the 
              automation of the process of workflow management.  They will also design a tool
              for the graphical representation of C programs that will help the users to
              visualize the entire workflow.  

Scope:  In this project the collaborators
              plan to combine their expertise in an important area of scientific research. 
              The expertise of the US scientist and his team has been in the design,
              implementation and use of the Causal Calculator.  The Turkish researchers have
              been working on workflow management and its relation to action languages.  Two
              US graduate students from Dr. Lifschitz' department will participate in the
              project and will work in Turkey with their foreign counterparts, thus gaining
              an international research experience early in their careers. The project meets
              INT criteria for support of cooperative projects that are mutually beneficial,
              and which help give international experiences to young scientists and graduate
              students.
