Abstract    :
              This proposal funds a set of interactions, in particular a workshop next
month,
              between humanists and computer researchers to expand on the
possible uses of
              new technology in humanities research and teaching.
The proposal comes from
              the National Initiative for a Networked Cultural
Heritage.  It supplements
              Rockefeller Foundation funding.

The major purpose of the workshop and the
              related activities is to
prepare a research agenda for the area of
              computational humanities and
define problems and needs for new technology,
              both to help the humanists
in their scholarship and educational activities,
              and to help explore the
new challenges and opportunities for information
              technology presented
by these areas.
