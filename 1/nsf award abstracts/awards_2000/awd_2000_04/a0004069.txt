This award supports a collaborative research Project
              between Caltech (EAR-0004069) and Vanderbilt University to develop an Ultra
              High Resolution Scanning Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID)
              Microscope (UHRSSM) for Paleomagnetic and Rock Studies.  The instrument will be
              based on a small superconducting pickup coil coupled to a SQUID sensor housed
              in the vacuum space of a cyrostat, suspended behind a thin sapphire window less
              than 50mm above a room temperature sample.  Scanning the sample allows us to
              map the z-component of the magnetic field above the sample with spatial
              resolutions as small as 100mm (limited mainly by the pickup coil diameter). 
              The close spacing between sample and pickup coil results in an increase in
              sensitivity by four orders of magnitude compared to commercial SQUID moment
              magnetometers. The new instruments will allow for new classes of paleomagnetic
              analyses: (1) Conglomerate, baked contact, and fold tests on extremely small
              spatial scales, vastly expanding the utility of of these critical geological
              field tests of magnetic stability, (2) a suite of rock-magnetic and
              paleomagnetic experiments on standard petrographic thin sections, allowing the
              observed magnetic components to be matched with the minerals that are present,
              (3) Thellier-Thellier paleointensity analyses on individual mineral grains and
              at very high rates, (4) high resolution magnetic stratigraphy, and (5) spatial
              correlation of rock magnetic data with SEM, microprobe and other data on thin
              sections, at submillimeter scales.
