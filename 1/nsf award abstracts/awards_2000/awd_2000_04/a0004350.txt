Abstract    :
              
This research investigates comparative institutions of corporate governance
              and financial regulation around the world.  The organizing theme is the
              difference in legal traditions among countries, and their implications for the
              structure of the economy.  The research is divided into three broad areas: 1)
              empirical investigation of investor protection in financial markets, especially
              in the context of securities laws, 2) theoretical research on the structure of
              laws and their enforcement, and 3) broader empirical investigation of legal
              institutions in different countries, particularly as related to their legal
              traditions.  The ultimate goal of this research is to have an integrated view
              of the differences in legal and regulatory frameworks, and more generally in
              the relationship between the government and the private sector, among market
              economies.  We would like to understand the systematic and measurable
              differences in how market economies are organized.
