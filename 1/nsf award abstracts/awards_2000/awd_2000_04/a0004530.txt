Abstract    :
              This project will conduct a hydrothermal plume survey along a portion of the
              South West Indian Ridge to establish distribution of hydrothermal activity.  In
              addition an initial description of rocks recovered from dredges along the rift
              valley wall and ridge axis will be done to assess potential for further
              study.
