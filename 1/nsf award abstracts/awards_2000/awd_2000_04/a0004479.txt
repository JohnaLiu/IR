Abstract    :
              The PI will continue her investigations on interannual and interdecadal climate
              variability over tropical Africa. The focus is on west Africa, both the Sahel
              and Guinea Coast regions, and on equatorial Central Africa, a region where
              meteorological processes contributing to climatic variability are poorly
              understood. The study has an observational component, relying on past
              experience in observational analysis and the compilation of extensive data sets
              for West Africa, as well as a modeling component limited mainly to linear
              dynamical models. 

The PI suggests a new paradigm for understanding
              interannual and interdecadal variability in Sahelian Africa involving the
              latitudinal position of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) and the role of the
              equatorial westerlies in displacing the jet northward into the Sahel region.
              Some of the key related questions to be addressed are (i) reasons for the shift
              in the AEJ; (ii) reasons for the development of deep equatorial Westerly jet in
              the monsoon flow over west Africa; and (iii) contrasts in the dynamics and
              energetics in the two stable modes of the jet. The role of the Tropical
              Easterly Jet, the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone, the moist layer and Easterly
              wave activity in interannual rainfall variability will also be studied.

The
              work is important because better understanding of climate variability over this
              region will lead to better predictability of rainfall, and this has important
              societal benefits.
