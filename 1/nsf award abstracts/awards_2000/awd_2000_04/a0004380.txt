Abstract    :
              This research is to study and model the variability of F region plasma and
              neutral atmospheric transport processes from equatorial to upper mid-latitudes
              using incoherent scatter radar and nighttime Fabry-Perot interferometer
              measurements from Peru, Arecibo and Millstone Hill.  The PI's earlier
              experimental ionospheric disturbance electric field studies will be
              complemented by numerical simulations using the recently upgraded Rice
              Convection Model.  The basic objective is the understanding and self-consistent
              empirical modeling of the short-term and spatial variability and effects of
              ionospheric electric fields and neutral winds, as well as the testing of global
              convection and circulation models.

Large new databases of incoherent scatter
              radar drift measurements will be used to model the variability of mid- and
              low-latitude ionospheric disturbance plasma drifts, and their time constants,
              as a function of magnetospheric and high latitude ionospheric parameters.  A
              storm-time dependent model of the nighttime thermospheric neutral winds to high
              latitude forcing using very extensive Fabry-Perot data from Arequipa, Arecibo,
              and Millstone Hill will be developed.  These global plasma drift and neutral
              wind studies will also examine the effects of long and short duration high
              latitude forcing, UT and very large storm effects, and also storm time
              dependent coupling of disturbance winds and plasma drifts.  The equatorial
              studies will include the variability of the quiet time daytime plasma drifts
              using JULIA data, and the study and empirical modeling of nighttime F-region
              neutral temperatures.
