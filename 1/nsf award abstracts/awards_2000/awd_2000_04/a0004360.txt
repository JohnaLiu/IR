Abstract    :
              This project will study the use and implementation of an environmental
              management system standard developed by the International Organization for
              Standardization (ISO). Public concern for the environment has spread across the
              globe, with national policy responses resulting in an increasingly complex web
              of diverse and often contradictory non-tariff barriers to trade. The growing
              number of incompatible environmental import restrictions has resulted in
              decreased efficiency and profit for corporations that export to multiple
              developed countries. In response, ISO 14000, is an attempt on the part of the
              International Standards Organization, to create common environmental management
              systems that will assist firms in their efforts to meet these increasingly
              stringent environmental laws, while simplifying the process of product export
              through the evolution of uniform requirements. This study, in particular, will
              explore several questions: 1) will ISO 14000 produce deglobalization and
              continued wealth inequalities in less developed regions, 2) will the ISO 14000
              regime be biased in the interest of the wealthier countries and leave less
              developed countries will fewer benefits from participation, and 3) will
              implementation be shaped by firms and governments efforts to achieve their
              goals.  In sum, the project will investigate the impact that public policies
              have on firm's decisions to opt-in to the ISO 14000 regime, while shedding
              light on the impact that ISO 14000 will have on international trade and the
              environment. Data will be gathered from a large-scale mail survey of ISO 14001
              certified firms in developing countries, along with personal interviews with
              industry and government officials.  This project will provide an understanding
              of the varying public policy responses to the globalization of environmental
              management, while also providing policy makers with information about the costs
              and benefits of various policy options juncture.
