Abstract    :
              This project includes organization of a workshop to be conducted by the National
              Science Foundation (NSF) with support from the International Technology
              Research Institute (ITRI).  The objective of this workshop, to be held
              September 13-14, 2000, is to gather facts and opinions from the U. S. research
              community on how the emerging area of Quantitative Systems Biology should be
              defined for purposes of a research initiative by the National Science
              Foundation, Directorate of Engineering (ENG).  This will include an overview of
              U. S. and international research and development that fall within this
              definition, and to identify areas where enhanced NSF/ENG support could make an
              important contribution.  The information presented at the workshop will be
              distilled into a report for NSF/ENG.
