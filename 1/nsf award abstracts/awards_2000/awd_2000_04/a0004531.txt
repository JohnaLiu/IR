Abstract    :
              The communication discipline has grown at a steady pace over the past fifty
              years. It has begun to take its place among the other social science
              disciplines in terms of theory development and building a knowledge base.
              Communication as a discipline is not well understood, however. It has,
              therefore, been slow to be included in interdisciplinary science research
              projects, despite the fact that communication research would improve the
              quality of these projects and would, in some cases, prove to be a crucial
              element affecting the research results.

To provide a means of informing the
              scientific community and federal funding agencies of the value of communication
              research to development of scientific knowledge, the National Communication
              Association will sponsor a working conference to review the significant
              scientific findings in communication and to develop a document that will inform
              others about the value of communication to science.

The conference will be
              held March 1-4, 2001, in Tucson, Arizona, with preliminary work already
              completed at the annual meeting of the National Communication Association,
              November 9-12, 2000, in Seattle, Washington. The work of the conference will be
              facilitated by the use of a Group Decision Support System laboratory at the
              University of Arizona. Following the meeting, one or two individuals will edit
              the work into a paper, which will then be printed as a booklet suitable for
              wide distribution.
