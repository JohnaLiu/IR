Postdoctoral: New Shape and Reflectance Models for Vision
              and Image-Based Rendering

Two areas of computer vision and image-based
              rendering are to be explored
by the postdoctoral associate.  The first project
              will result in methods
for more realistically rendering scenes by constructing
              surface reflectance
models from image data.  The result could lead to a new
              way to measure a
bi-directional density function under known lighting
              conditions and to
render images under novel lighting conditions.  The second
              project aims to
explore the recognition of objects whose shapes are
              continuously changing.
The problem is phrased as an abstract contour shape
              recognition problem
where shape evolves dynamically.  Several immediate
              applications in biology
and related fields are expected.
