Abstract    :
              We propose to use atomic scale features in the dynamic contact between carbon
              nanotube (CNT) electrical leads to create a voltage to frequency converter, a
              GHz frequency mixer, and an atomic resolution linear encoder in an integrated
              sub-micron device.  While many of the constituent capabilities required to
              accomplish our ecperimental goal have been demonstrated in our previous
              research, several challenges remain.  Although electrostatic deflections and
              induced mechanical resonance of carbon nanotubes have been demonstrated, an
              integrated CNT oscillator has yet to be constructed.  Over the coming year we
              propose to observe modulations inthe current across CNT/CNT junctions due to
              atomic corrugation, build suspended nanotube resonators with 100MHz - 10 GHz
              response in an integrated device, and combine these effects into the devices
              proposed above.  These devices will introduce the ultimate length scale and
              atomic lattice spacings into integrated actuating devices.
