Abstract    :
              The San Diego Natural History Museum is committed to the research and
              interpretation of the Southern California and Baja California area.  New
              permanent exhibits to convey the excitement and relevance of natural history
              study is the focus of this planning grant.

The planning project has three
              goals.  First, it will devise a master plan that establishes a philosophical
              foundation and the organizing framework for exhibit development.  Second, a
              schematic design that articulates content, space allocation and exhibit
              techniques will be made.  Finally, a plan for related materials and programs
              that will fund, enhance and expand the exhibit effort will be constructed.  The
              twelve-month planning proceess will be evaluated and the results disseminated
              and added to the field of museum learning research.
