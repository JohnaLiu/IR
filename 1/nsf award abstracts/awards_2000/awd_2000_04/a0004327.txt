Abstract    :
              This grant supports an initial five-week field trip to the Santa Cruz Islands in
              the Solomon Islands of the Western Pacific, to investigate the possibilities of
              conducting more extensive fieldwork on one of the non-Austronesian ('Papuan')
              languages spoken there. Three of these languages, which have not yet been
              described, are of considerable interest. First, they are the easternmost Papuan
              languages, separated by over 250 miles from the closest Papuan languages, and
              are at best only remotely related to other languages. Second, while they are
              generally classified as non-Austronesian, they are also appropriately
              classified as mixed languages: half of their basic vocabulary and many of the
              grammatical morphemes are Austronesian. Finally, these languages have a small
              number of speakers and may be considered endangered. The long-range goal is to
              conduct fieldwork on these languages.
