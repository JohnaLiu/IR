This dissertation enhancement award supports a U.S. graduate
              student, Pratigya J. Polissar,  working under the guidance of Raymond S.
              Bradley, Department of Geosciences, University of Massachusetts, who will spend
              six months in the laboratory of Aldo Shemesh at The Weizmann Institute of
              Science in Rehovot, Israel.  The research will focus on the technique for
              measuring the oxygen isotope composition of diatom silica and applying it to
              Holocene lake sediments from Venezuela.  The analysis of isotopes in diatom
              silica is difficult and Dr. Shemesh's lab is one of the best sites in the world
              for these measurements.  Understanding the natural variability of the climate
              system is essential for prediction and interpretation of current and future
              climate change.  In tropical regions, the balance between precipitation and
              evaporation is a key climatic parameter and analysis of the oxygen isotopic
              composition of diatoms preserved in lake sediments is a relatively new and
              exciting method for reconstructing it.  This research will make an important
              contribution to our understanding of climate by providing a detailed
              paleoclimate record of changes in tropical South America during the last 10,000
              years.
