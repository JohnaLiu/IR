Abstract    :
              
Decentralization of political authority to municipal governments has become a
              very common, if not dominating, policy strategy for addressing governance
              problems associated with environmental degradation in developing countries.
              Yet, the scientific understanding of the environmental impacts of
              decentralization reform remains very limited.

This Doctoral Dissertation
              Research project  investigates under what conditions one can expect local
              governments in decentralized developing countries to construct adequate regimes
              for land use planning. To this end, the project undertakes a comparative study
              of municipal governments' performance in the environmental sector in the
              tropical lowlands of Bolivia. To assess the linkages between observed patterns
              of biophysical change and municipal government policies and practices, the
              project uses of a wide array of complementary field methods. These include (1)
              a survey instrument administered to 35 randomly selected municipal governments;
              (2) qualitative institutional analysis of four selected municipalities, and (3)
              a time-series analysis of land use and land cover changes -using remotely
              sensed satellite imagery from 1972, 1986 and 1999. In the final stages of the
              research project, resource user groups along with municipal and central
              government representatives are invited to a workshop to discuss preliminary
              findings and viable policy options.
