Abstract    :
                                The roots of our species appear to be in Africa.  Some of the
              earliest and most exciting traces of our distant ancestry have been unearthed
              in Ethiopia.  Here the PIs propose to pursue further paleoanthropological and
              archaeological investigations in a very promising area of the West Central Afar
              region of Ethiopia, or the Gona. The Gona Project has three major research
              goals for the fieldwork planned in 2001. These include detailed geological
              studies and  archaeological excavations at 1) DAN1, a new 2.6 million year old
              (my) archaeological site with evidence of the earliest known in situ stone
              artifacts and fossilized animal bones, 2) BSN12, a site which yielded a partial
              skull of a Homo erectus and associated Oldowan and Early Acheulian stone
              artifacts estimated between 1.5-1.0 my, and 3) DAN5 where a nearly complete
              skull of an early Homo estimated between 2,0-1.5 my was discovered in
              association with surface Oldowan and Early Acheulian artifacts. DAN1and BSN12
              were identified in 1999 and DAN5 was discovered in 2000.
	Previous research at
              Gona has resulted in the discovery of thousands of stone tools dated to 2.5 my,
              but fossilized animal bones were absent from the excavations. Bones with
              evidence of stone tool cut-marks dated to 2.5 my were recently discovered at
              Bouri, in the Middle Awash study area, but there were no excavated artifacts
              found in direct association with the bones. Despite the lack of artifacts in
              direct association with cut-marked bones,  it was argued that ancestral humans
              began making artifacts for processing carcasses for meat. Thus far, the
              earliest evidence for associated artifacts and bones comes from Hadar in
              deposits dated to 2.3 my.  The only known 2.6 my old  in situ stone artifacts
              and associated animal bones are those discovered in the year 2000 from Gona (at
              DAN1). This new site promises to yield critical evidence for understanding
              early human diet, for studying the function of the earliest stone tools and for
              providing  important clues regarding the factors that triggered early human
              flaked stone production.
	The BSN12 and DAN5 sites have yielded important
              hominids, stone artifacts and well-preserved fauna. However, further
              archaeological and paleontological test-excavations, and detailed geological
              studies are needed 1) to firmly determine the age of the sites and 2) to
              ascertain the stratigraphic relationships of the hominids, the artifacts and
              the fossil bones. A major  component of the geological study will involve
              sampling of sediments for paleomagnetic analyses and tuffs for geochemical
              correlations for resolving the age of these important discoveries.
