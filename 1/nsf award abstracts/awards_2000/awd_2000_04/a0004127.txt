              This workshop is intended to provide a select group of teachers with an
              increased understanding of program evaluation in general as well as the
              emerging dicussion about the relevance of culture in program evaluation
              research and practices.  Participants will be provided with an increased
              awareness of program evaluation, its importance for improving the educational
              success of minority students in urban school settings, and how program
              evaluation could be more culturally responsive.  The workshop will  involve
              minority and female teachers with 3-5 years experience in culturally diverse
              classrooms.  In addition, teachers will receive 5-8 CE credits for their
              attendance at the workshop.
