Abstract    :
              The "Setting A Research Agenda:  Parents as Informal Mathematics Educators"
              conference will convene parents, researchers in parent/child learning, a
              methodological/research design expert, a developmental psychologist, and
              representatives from mathematics professional organizations.  The goals of the
              conference include:  1) summarizing the goals, methods and findings of the
              leading research in parent/child mathematics learning;  2) establishing the
              agenda for future research in this area; and  3) charting a short- and
              long-term plan of action to accomplish these research goals.
