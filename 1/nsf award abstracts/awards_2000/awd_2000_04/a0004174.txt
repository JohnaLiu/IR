Abstract    :
              This project supports the activities of the Construction and Building
              subcommittee of the National Science Foundation and Technology council.
              Thirteen federal agencies including, NSF participates in the subcommittee
              meetings. The subcommittee holds meeting monthly at the White House Conference
              Center in Washington, D.C. The subcommittee secretariat coordinates federal
              participation in the presidential initiative-partnership for the Advancement of
              Technology in housing (a partnership between the public sector, industry, and
              academia). A strategic plan for the Construction and Building Subcommittee is
              under development by the subcommittee. The plan identifies a number of options
              under the following four strategic directions:

Focus and prioritize federal
              R&D and coordinate with private R&D to accelerate technical development in
              construction and building

Develop multiagency support for specific research
              projects of interest to the public and private sectors

Provide vehicles for
              information exchange that support and promote acceptance of new technology in
              construction and building

Demonstrate actions that will lead to achieving
              the National Construction Goals.  

NSF has supported the activities of the
              Construction and Building Subcommittee since 1994.
