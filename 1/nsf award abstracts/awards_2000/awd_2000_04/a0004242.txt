Abstract    :
              This dissertation research project focuses the evolution over half a century of
              the Washington, DC metro system with the intent to better understand the role
              of urban rail systems in the postwar age.
The study draws on two bodies of
              scholarly literature. The first is a long-running debate over the wisdom of
              investments in new urban rail systems since the 1970s. Many planners applaud
              these systems as the best hope for combating the ills of automobile dominated
              sprawl, with its attendant problems of pollution, energy wastefulness, and
              social isolation. But many economists deride rail as a shiny toy that consumes
              public funds better used for bus transit. Neither side of this debate has
              examined the detailed, qualitative history of a rail system.  This research
              project hopes to show that in the real world, decisionmaking and the settings
              of goals are more complicated than the factors considered by economic models.
              The second body of scholarship is the study of the history of technology,
              especially the myth-and-symbol approach of Leo Marx and his followers and the
              study of the social construction of technology. Applying these approaches to
              postwar rail transit can explain how one intensely public technology
              accumulates functions as it evolves.
