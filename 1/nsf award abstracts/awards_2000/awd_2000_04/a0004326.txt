ABSTRACT

Springfield Technical Community College plans to leverage
              its extensive experience with technical education and with assistive/adaptive
              technology to increase participation of students with disabilities in science,
              mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) education.  The primary goal of
              the project is to demonstrate and disseminate a professional development model
              to engage SMET faculty in the Universal Design of Curricula to support the
              learning of students with disabilities.  The institution and its project staff
              will rely on their experience acquired in the Advanced Technical Education
              (ATE) Center in the design of specialized technical simulation, courseware, and
              laboratory-based components of SMET curricula.  A cohort of 30 disabled
              students, half of whom experience sensory disabilities, will be the principal
              target population upon which the materials are piloted and tested.  Evaluation
              will include an examination of outcomes of a "train-the-trainer" model of
              professional development, wherein a cohort of SMET faculty are trained and
              serve as mentors to other faculty within their academic divisions to expand and
              accelerate the diffusion of Universal Curriculum Design of SMET courses.  The
              Springfield Technical Community College actively participates in extensive
              Northeast and national networks of ATE institutions (including both high
              schools and community colleges) that will permit broad dissemination of the
              project's results and products.
