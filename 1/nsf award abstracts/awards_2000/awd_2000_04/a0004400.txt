	Migratory behavior is one of the more fascinating aspects
              of the biology of birds, but little is known with certainty about the evolution
              of migration in genera and families of birds with contrasting migratory and
              non-migratory species. Dr. Kevin Omland is studying this problem in the oriole
              genus Icterus, focusing on three pairs of closely related species, each with a
              migratory and non-migratory representative. Molecular DNA data are to be
              collected from numerous individuals sampled from populations in the U.S. and
              Mexico; field work in Mexico has already been completed with assistance from
              ornithologists at the National University of Mexico City. The data will be used
              to construct fine-scale genealogies of the species pairs, in comparison with
              all other species in the genus (ca. 25 species total) in turn to test whether
              the direction of evolution has been from ancestral migratory behavior to
              non-migratory, or the reverse. In addition, the geographic spread of sampling
              will allow some preliminary prediction of the likely geographic course of
              evolution in these three species pairs, which range from tropical to temperate
              zones across Central and North America. Longer term, the research will help to
              assess how malleable or adaptable is migratory behavior in birds, in response
              to ecological conditions, or how constrained it may be by genetic heritage.
