Abstract    :
              The investigators will develop an undergraduate course for non-science majors
              that uses the real-life effects of space weather as a motivation for teaching
              the basic concepts of electricity and magnetism.  The effort builds on the
              successful development of the Solar System Collaboratory that uses Java applets
              running on personal computers.  The applets present to the user a familiar
              button-and-slider interface that hides calculations, allowing non-science
              majors with limited math skills to engage in precise quantitative reasoning. 
              One of the most troubling tendencies that science departments face today is an
              increase in the number of students that become disenfranchised with science. 
              This course is designed to increase interest of non-majors in science by
              putting the "grammar" of science in the background, so students can concentrate
              on the "prose".  The course will be tailored for both high school science
              classes and for college non-science majors, and will go through extensive
              classroom testing at three Colorado schools.
