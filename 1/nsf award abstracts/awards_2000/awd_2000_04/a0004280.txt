Special Projects:  Workshop
              to Establish a Research Agenda in Learning Science and Technology

This award
              supports a workshop to define major research areas in learning science and
              technology, in particular at large scale, identifying the most pressing
              research needs and suggest ways of combining these topics into themes.  This is
              a timely and very important project, as universities and other deliveries of
              training and education struggle to re-define their teaching methods given the
              extraordinary changes just beginning due to ubiquitous high-performance
              computing and networking.

This workshop is related to an overall effort by
              NSF and others to foster the development of the Learning Federation (LF), a
              fledgling research organization designed to undertake research in this area. 
              As envisioned by the organizers, the Learning Federation will model itself
              after consortia such as Sematech in the semiconductor industry; it will support
              pre-competitive, not-for-profit research among a consortium of industry,
              government, foundations and universities and will be managed and governed by
              the consortium members.  The LF goal is to achieve a critical mass of projects
              by providing long-term, stable, "large-grain" funding for interdisciplinary
              research teams.  The LF will fund basis learning science and technology as well
              as appropriate uses of technology and experimental content such as libraries of
              learning objects and courses.  The focus will initially be on undergraduate,
              graduate, and life-long learning.  The result will be a next generation of
              learning environments suited to a network context
