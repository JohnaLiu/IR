Abstract    :
              This project seeks to investigate control systems for a human-machine shared
              locomotion platform to assist the human in pedestrian mobility. 
The project
              is specifically motivated by the need of  the elderly. The elderly are often
              restricted in their mobility and must rely on canes, walkers, and ultimately,
              wheelchairs for indoor mobility. Restrictions in mobility lead to a loss of
              independence for the elderly, often resulting in nursing home admission. This
              research will develop a control system for a semi-autonomous, wheeled "walker"
              (c.f. a lightweight frame used in the aid of walking) in which the user
              provides the locomotive force and the user and the walker collaborate on the
              steering.  Specific investigation includes developing shared control techniques
              that assists the ambulatory elderly in guidance in known environments,
              providing basic safety measures in known and unknown environments (i.e. curb
              detection and automatic braking), implementing a hardware prototype and
              empirically testing the performance of the system using a variety of discrete
              situations developed in concert with geriatrics professionals.The essence of
              this research is to explore new control techniques appropriate for shared
              control with elderly operators.
