This award supports Eric Swanson and students from the
              University of Pittsburgh in a collaboration with David Blaschke of the
              Department of Physics at the University of Rostock, Germany.  The research
              focus is on the dependence of hadronic and astrophysical observables as these
              relate to the search for a quark-gluon plasma (QGP).  The collaboration
              combines complementary expertise because the German side has experience in
              exploring evidence for QGP formation in heavy-ion collisions and is now
              pioneering the search for astrophysical signals, whereas the U.S. side has
              developed a systematic approach to analyzing constituent-interchange processes
              from the lightest interactions of pi-mesons to the heaviest B-meson exchanges. 
              This joint collaborative research effort also presents junior researchers with
              the opportunity to work internationally, and the work done on this proposal
              will help institutionalize the relationship between the German and U.S.
              research groups.
