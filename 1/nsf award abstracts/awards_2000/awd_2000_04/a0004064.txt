This grant provides partial support for the costs of upgrading
              the superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) at Florida International University
              with direct current (DC) superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs),
              replacing the cold head and cryocooler compressor, and modifying the helium
              dewar.  The PI has documented that the current SRM at FIU (11 years old) is
              fraught with problems including, rapid He boil off, frequent ice blocks in the
              He plumbing lines and a non-functional y-axis radio frequency (Rf) SQUID
              leaving only two components of the magnetic field measurable with the aging
              machine.  DC SQUIDs offer over an order of magnitude increase in measurement
              sensitivity over Rf SQUIDs and are now the de facto standard sensors used in
              state-of-the-art SRMs by leading paleomagnetists.  The addition of a new He
              dewar and cryocooler compressor will also, increase available analysis time on
              this instrument between fills, decrease the operational costs of the
              instrument, and increase the useful life of the instrument by reducing the
              number of thermal cycles required per operating hour. 
The upgraded
              magnetometer will allow for continued studies of paleomagnetic field behavior
              near polarity transitions and will be used to train a racially diverse crop of
              undergraduate and M.S. students in paleomagnetic research methods.
