This dissertation enhancement award supports Ms. Noel Day, a
              graduate student with Dr. Albert Ichiki of the University of Tennessee Medical
              Center, to conduct research with Dr. Kazunori Yokoyama of the DNA Bank of the
              Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) in Tsukuba, Japan.  The
              joint study will investigate gene regulation in the major histocompatibility
              complex (MHC).  The importance of MHC molecules to the immune response has made
              them a leading topic in the field of immunology research, and the role of
              transcription factors, such as the class II transactivator (CIITA), in the
              induction of the immune response has become a central focus.  The objectives of
              this project are to use an MHC class II deficient cell line to demonstrate the
              requirement of the CIITA for class II expression, and to characterize the
              important binding domains and enzymatic activities associated with other
              transcription factors. 

This project offers the potential for broad
              application of the results in the fields of immunology and medicine.  The U.S.
              graduate student will have access to expertise and facilities at RIKEN's DNA
              Bank that will greatly facilitate the research.
