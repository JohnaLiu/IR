Abstract    :
              This award is for post-doctoral research on sporadic micrometeor mass influx
              into the upper atmosphere.  The study makes use of data from the Arecibo Radar
              in Puerto Rico and the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) radar in Norway. 
              The micrometeor velocities will be deduced from Doppler measurements made by
              the radars.  The comparison between the Arecibo and EISCAT results will reveal
              summer and winter differences at the two locations.  The differential in flux
              may play a major role in the formation of noctilucent clouds and related summer
              upper atmosphere phenomena that may be harbingers of global change.  Meteoroid
              destruction mechanisms and deposition of meteoric mass will also be
              investigated.  This is critical to elucidating the origins of metal layers
              above the meteor zone and the observed low atmospheric abundance of calcium
              relative to that expected from meteorite composition.
