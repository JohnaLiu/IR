Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to
              organize a national workshop to define the information technology requirements
              of the earthquake engineering research community for the NSF program entitled
              Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation.   This workshop will seek input
              from the earthquake engineering research community in the following areas:  (1)
              access to shared use earthquake engineering research equipment, (2) supporting
              telecollaboration and teleoperation of the shared use equipment,  (3) shared
              use of distributed heterogeneous data sets, (4) definition of new data types
              and metadata schemes, (5) use and sharing of simulation models, and (6) use of
              advanced visualization technologies and tools.    The results of this workshop
              will be disseminated on the World Wide Web and in printed form.
