This grant provides partial support to equip a cosmogenic
              nuclide sample preparation facility at the University of California, Berkeley. 
              Professors James Kirchner and William Dietrich will be the principal users of
              this facility.  The Department of Earth and Planetary Science has recently
              renovated and upgraded a 46 square meter (500 square foot) laboratory for
              cosmogenic nuclide sample preparation.  This grant provides funds to outfit
              this laboratory for efficient preparation of 10Be and 26Al samples from
              geological materials.  Equipment to be purchased under this grant includes an
              atomic absorption spectrophotometer, a high-throughput magnetic separator, an
              ultrapure water supply, ultrasonic baths, precision balances, and a centrifuge.
               A dedicated cosmogenic nuclide sample preparation facility will permit more
              efficient sample preparation, and thus higher sample throughput rates.  This,
              in turn, will greatly aid ongoing research in several areas, including
              measurements of river bed erosion and debris flow incision, determination of
              catchment-scale chemical weathering rates, comparisons of long-term and
              present-day landscape erosion rates, and assessments of how climatic,
              topographic, and tectonic factors affect long-term rates of weathering and
              erosion.
