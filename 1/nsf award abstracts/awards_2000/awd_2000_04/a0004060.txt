Abstract    :
              This work will provide a structural "health" monitoring capability for
              Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composite bridge decks.  Three bridge decks are
              being built by an interdisciplinary team of the University of Missouri-Rolla
              (UMR) investigators to demonstrate the effectiveness of new FRP composite in
              enhancing constructability, life span, and performance.  Each bridge deck will
              feature a different construction technology.  They are being constructed in the
              City of St. James, Missouri using funds from the UMR, the City of St. James,
              and the Missouri Department of Economic Development.  The construction contract
              has been awarded; hence, the funding need was immediate for adding "health"
              monitoring.  Multiple fiber-optic strain sensors are being incorporated for
              long-term dynamic and static monitoring of performance and strength in this
              supplementary program which is being supported as a Small Grant for Exploratory
              Research (SGER).
