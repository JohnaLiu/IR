Abstract    :
              The explosive growth of computer networks has created the potential to access a
              great deal of computing power and information, but new models of distributed
              computing are required to fully utilize these resources.  Cooperative
              distributed problem solving (CDPS) is concerned with solving large-scale
              problems using systems of intelligent software agents, distributed among
              networked computers, working cooperatively.  CDPS approaches can produce highly
              flexible and reliable systems, and can be used for a wide range of potential
              applications.  The goal of this project is to make it easier to to build CDPS
              systems for real-world applications, by improving the understanding of how
              system and domain characteristics interact to affect the performance of CDPS
              systems, and by identifying CDPS strategies that perform well under particular
              conditions. This will allow CDPS techniques to be more widely applied than they
              currently are.  The project will pursue this goal by: developing formalisms for
              modeling CDPS systems as distributed search processes; implementing software
              tools that use these models to predict the performance of CDPS systems;
              identifying generic domain characteristics that are critical for predicting
              CDPS performance; and performing a broad range of experiments to build up a
              suite of effective abstract CDPS strategies.
