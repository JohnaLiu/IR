ABSTRACT:
A workshop focused on health monitoring of long span
              bridges is to be held in conjunction with the 2001 joint 8th annual Smart
              Structures and Materials Conference and the 6th annual Nondestructive
              Evaluation (NDE) for Health Monitoring and Diagnostics Conference.  Workshop
              topics include discussion of large/long-span bridge systems including
              financial, environmental, design, construction, and jurisdiction issues and
              current operational and maintenance practices.  Research and development needs
              to be discussed include new and emerging technologies in NDE, smart materials
              and structures, intelligent transportation systems and health monitoring. 
              Focused discussions will be held on the Woodrow Wilson Bridge Technology
              Demonstration Project.  In particular, the workshop will permit formation of a
              cross-disciplinary expert panel to address critical issues associated with this
              opportunity for the development, integration and operation of civil
              infrastructure systems health monitoring in conjunction with this major
              transportation test-bed.
