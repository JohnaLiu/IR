This award supports a planning visit for Tara Prasad Das of the
              State University of New York at Albany to discuss collaborative research with
              faculty members of the Physics Department at the Tribhuvan University (TU),
              Kathmandu.  Proposed topics include electronic structures and associated
              properties of a number of condensed matter, biophysical, atomic and molecular
              systems. The projects will be mutually beneficial and working collaboratively
              is expected to enhance the abilities of both groups to carry out investigations
              more effectively than would have been possible had they worked separately.
