This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs of
              the National Science Foundation, provides support for a special conference,
              sponsored jointly with NASA, on building and deploying autonomous systems in
              extreme environments. Autonomous Systems are defined as permanent geophysical
              or astrophysical installations that are self-sustaining over periods of months
              and years. They acquire data on a regular time interval or upon a triggering
              event and either store that data or transmit it to a data center. Many
              investigators conduct research in polar, sea floor, or other extreme
              environments that require autonomous systems. Because of the burgeoning
              scientific potential for such systems, the present is a good time to bring the
              community together during a workshop in order to discuss the special challenges
              associated with developing these systems for extreme environments so that past
              mistakes can be minimized and past successes can be built upon toward better
              scientific output. The conference venue was the Von Karman Auditorium at the
              Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and the conference was held
              in September, 1999. The goals of the workshop were to promote dialogue on
              autonomous system design, make recommendations on power, thermal, data,
              communications, and packaging systems, and to decide on standardization for
              future systems. The workshop also included discussion of, and recommendations
              for, testing criteria that should be met before systems could deployed in
              extreme environments. These funds are to prepare, publish, and disseminate the
              results of the workshop.
