There is a long-standing need for engineering materials that
              are in one way or another self lubricating.
These materials are promising for
              a variety of applications where conventional lubricants either
cannot be used
              (e.g., joint replacement surgery in humans), or where their use is too costly
              (e.g.
deployed space vehicles, such as satellites, space-based observatories,
              and permanently deployed
space exploration equipment). Self-lubricated
              components also hold promise for preventing premature
failure of
              micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). To design an effective
              self-lubricated
material from the molecular, nano-scale, it is necessary that
              lubricant molecules possess high surface mobility even when chemically grafted
              to a rigid substrate. The objective of the proposed research is two-fold:
              First, to fundamentally understand dynamics of uncharged polymeric and
              oligomeric species tethered to solid substrates; and Second, to develop
              high-mobility oligomer and polymer lubricating coatings using
tethered
              molecules, as a design of lubricating surfaces from the nano-scale up. The
              suitability of these coatings for self-lubricated MEMS fabrication will be
              evaluated in collaboration with researchers at the Cornell Nanofabrication
              facility.
