	This award provides funding support for the development and
              maintenance of the High-Pressure X-Ray Facility (HPXF). The HPXF maintains two
              branches of superconducting wiggler beamline X17 at the National Synchrotron
              Light Source located at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The beamline offers
              high brilliance X-radiation for use mainly by the high-pressure mineral physics
              research community. The HPXF facility also maintains supporting high-pressure
              equipment and provides technical assistance for visitors using the synchrotron
              radiation. Scientific research applications by users include studies of earth
              and planetary materials properties (for example, equations of state,
              elasticity, rheology, and phase relations) at high pressures and temperatures
              representative of conditions in the earth's deep interior.
