International Travel Award:  The 7th Internatonal Conference on Fundmentals
              of Adsorption


This award supports partially the participation by 30
              American researchers in the 7th International Conference on Fundamentals of
              Adsorption (FOA7) to be held in Nagasaki, Japan, 20-25 May 2001.  This
              conference provides a unique forum for dialog among international researchers
              in the field.   It will bring together about 300 researchers from 35 countries.
               Both academic and industrial researchers will participate in sessions on
              adsorption relating to gas separation processes, gas storage, energy-efficient
              refrigeration, and environmental protection.

Adsorption is a key phenomenon
              in many separation and catalytic processes as well as in nature, and the
              current research activity is dynamic, stimulated by new developments in
              materials synthesis, molecular modeling, and specific applications.  Much of
              the important new work is being done abroad, so it is vital that U.S.
              researchers maintain contact and collaboration with their foreign counterparts.
               This conference provides an opportunity to promote such contact.
