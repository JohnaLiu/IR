Abstract    :
              0004151
Under this award, the Civil Engineering Research Foundation (CERF) will
              work closely with the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other government
              agencies, academia, and industry including designated representatives from
              different basic construction materials groups to enhance and continue
              implementation of a program to identify and develop key research initiatives in
              high-performance construction materials and systems. The effort aims to
              expedite the commercialization of those initiatives that are essential for the
              revitalization of the nation's infrastructure and the enhancement of our global
              competitiveness. This commercialization effort reinforces and complements the
              Construction Technology Goals initiative developed under the Construction and
              Building (C&B) Subcommittee of the National Science and Technology Council
              (NSTC). The emphasis will be on the dissemination of key research findings and
              demonstration opportunities as well as the promoting and development of
              promising collaborative partnerships.***
