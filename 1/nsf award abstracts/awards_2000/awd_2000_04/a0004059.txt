This three-year award for U.S.-France collaboration
              involves Mark A. Kasevich and his group at Yale University and Philippe Bouyer
              and his group at the Laboratoire Charles Fabry de l'Institut d'Optique in
              Orsay.  The aim of the collaboration is the development of techniques and
              applications of atom interferometric rotation sensors.  In particular, the
              collaboration addresses:  comparison studies of US thermal atomic beam
              gyroscope with CNRS atomic found gyroscope;  development of a ground-based
              program to test General Relativity using atom interferometer gyroscopes;
              NASA/European Space Agency flight experiments relying on atom interferometer
              gyroscopes; and uses of Bose-Einstein condensed atomic sources for atom
              interferometry.  The US and French groups bring to this collaboration
              complementary expertise and comparable, high quality and precision instruments.
               

This award represents the US side of a joint proposal to the NSF and the
              French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel
              funds and living expenses for the US investigator and graduate students.  CNRS
              will support the visits of the French researchers to the United States. The
              collaboration will advance fundamental understanding of the wave nature of
              matter as well as the use of atom interferometer gyroscopes in space flights
              and navigation.
