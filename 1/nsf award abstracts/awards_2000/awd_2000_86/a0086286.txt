Abstract    :
              The US Army Research Office has agreed to fund "Advanced Concepts Workshop -
              Centrifuge Modelling Research for Civilian and Defense Applications: Taking
              Stock and Recommendations for Future Research" in January 2001.  The workshop
              will be held at the US Army Corps of Engineers Geotechnical Laboratory of ERDC
              in the Waterways Experiment Station in Vicksburg, MS.   Deborah Goodings at the
              University of Maryland, and Richard Ledbetter of the Geotechnical Laboratory of
              ERDC are the two primary organizers.   

The purpose of the workshop is to
              take stock of what has been accomplished to date using centrifuge modelling,
              and then to assess new directions for research considering the needs of both
              DoD and non-DoD research users.  Centrifuge researchers as well as research
              sponsors and users, both present and potential, will be invited to attend. This
              proposal to NSF is to request $15,000 in supplemental funding to subsidize
              travel for a group of academics who would not otherwise be likely to attend the
              workshop.  There are two components to the target group: first, junior faculty
              who work in related areas and who may be educated to the benefits of centrifuge
              modelling results in their research programs; and second, PhD students who
              presently are engaged in centrifuge model research, who will benefit from
              exposure to the Army facility, to the centrifuge modelling community, and to
              potential research sponsors. Special attention will be given to including
              underrepresented minorities and females in both groups.
