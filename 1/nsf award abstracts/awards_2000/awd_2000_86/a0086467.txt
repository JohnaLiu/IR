Abstract    :
              San Francisco State University's College of Science and Engineering (COSE) and
              the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) have collaboratively
              developed a GK-12Fellows project to serve students at underperforming middle
              and high schools (3 each).Fellows will be systematically prepared to support
              the efforts of SFUSD teachers todeliver an inquiry-based pedagogy rich in
              science and math content. Fifteen SFSUFellows per year will directly benefit by
              enhancing their teaching and learning skills;SFUSD will benefit by the having
              these Fellows co-teach with SFUSD teachers, tutor,and serve as school-based
              resources, knowledgeable about the content and the applicationof SMET. Fellows
              will complete two formal classes--one focused on pedagogy andanother focused on
              either the physical or natural sciences. To ensure compliance withstate and
              national standards as well as to develop collegial relationships, teachers
              willpartner with the Fellows in the content classes which will provide both
              with basicconcepts in integrated biological areas and in fundamental concepts
              of physical sciences,along with laboratory curriculum modules. Fellows will be
              selected from COSE's diverse(63% minority) student body. Inverness Research
              Associates, an evaluation groupspecializing in science education, will conduct
              a comprehensive evaluation with bothquantitative and qualitative
              components.
