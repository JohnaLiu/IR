Abstract    :
              This research explores the interconnect problem in nanotechnology, which
              involves solving problems relating to design of high density of devices and
              high speed of transmission of within the circuit. The approach is to
              investigate a modified version of the traditional metallic interconnects. The
              modification consists in using the concept of parallel processing by providing
              two or more paths between the driver and the load stacked vertically isolated
              from one another by insulating layers between them. In addition to heating
              problems, this research also studies the parasitics associated with such a
              structure, the propagation delays expected in it and the potential problem of
              crosstalk among the various paths of the same interconnect and that among the
              neighboring interconnects. The model of the multipath interconnects includes
              the self and coupling parasitic capacitances and inductances in addition to the
              very high-frequency effects.
