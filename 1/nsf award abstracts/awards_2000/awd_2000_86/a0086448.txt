Abstract    :
              This proposal outlines a plan to involve Rutgers University-Newark graduate
              students and advancedundergraduates with the Newark Public Schools, Newark
              Museum, and Kids Corporation as NSF TeachingFellows. The conceptual focus of
              the proposed program falls largely under the thematic heading of knowledge
              transfer and curriculum development. The university students will be trained to
              deliver
educational activities that are curriculumintegrated,
              inquiry-centered, and constructivist-based. The strength of the proposed
              program is that all participants, university students, teachers, and school
              students,will benefit from the experience. The benefits to be realized are
              inherent in the following program goals:

o to enhance the teaching skills of
              the university participants

o to motivate and excite students about science,
              mathematics, and technology

o to expose students to new ideas, resources,
              and potential careers and to demonstrate the relevance of their learning
              experiences to real life situations

o to contribute to student knowledge and
              understanding of science and mathematics

o to provide teachers an
              opportunity to collaborate with graduate students and advanced undergraduates
              indesigning learning experiences for their students and incorporate new ideas,
              activities, and resources into their curricula

o to provide teachers
              opportunities to learn, and become comfortable applying, hands-on,
              inquiry-based approaches to teaching.
