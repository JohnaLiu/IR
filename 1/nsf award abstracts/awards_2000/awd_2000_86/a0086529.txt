Abstract    :
                This project will explore three avenues in reasoning and knowledge
              representation:   development of new approximation methods that incorporate
              user-adaptive and any-time features;   development of hybrid knowledge-bases
              that combine deterministic information (constraints) and probabilistic
              information (belief networks), and which are both semantically coherent and
              computationally effective;   and application of hybrid languages and algorithms
              to temporal reasoning problems in the domains of planning, scheduling, and
              diagnosis.  The outcome of this research will include a system of algorithmic
              tools which address issues of non-tractability in an innovative and practical
              manner, and which are applicable to a new knowledge-based framework that allows
              the expression of both causal and constraint-like information, thus
              facilitating tasks such as planning, diagnosis and design.   Parameterization
              will allow users to control the algorithms and adjust them to their own domains
              and resources.   The computational tools will support the solution of
              challenging problems at the frontiers of diverse areas of science and industry
              such as robotics, planning and scheduling, bioinformatics (linkage analysis and
              protein secondary structure prediction), and e-commerce (multi-agent
              combinatorial auctions).
