              Educational Innovation Program: HPC Diagnostics for Scientific Computing in the
              Undergraduate Curriculum

This project transfers results of research in
              parallel algorithms into the undergraduate engineering curriculum at this
              university. The overall objective of the research component is the generation
              of learning tools that demonstrate how to analyze numerical algorithms for
              parallel processing for two important and realistic classes of engineering
              problems involving free and moving boundaries. Course modules enable students
              to easily and proficiently engage in high-performance parallel computing. A
              variety of software helps students analyze and understand execution behavior
              including problem partitioning, module communication patterns, processor load
              balancing, computation versus communication ratios, timing characteristics, and
              processor idle time. Specifically, the modules demonstrate the use of the
              computing diagnostic software applied to typical runs on a parallel computer
              for fixed and free and moving boundary value problems. The transfer of this
              research into the undergraduate curriculum enhances students' understanding of
              the capabilities of parallel computers for solving difficult engineering
              problems and enhances the computational infrastructure in engineering and other
              areas.
