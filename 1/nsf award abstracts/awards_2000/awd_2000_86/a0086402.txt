This proposal is to fund
              travel for US participants to a US-Japan International workshop on digital
              libraries and transportation support.  The planning workshop is being jointly
              organized by Columbia University and Kyoto University.  Both institutions are
              leaders in digital libraries and related research.  The workshop is largely by
              invitation and will include top researchers from the US, Japan and Europe.  The
              goals of the workshop are to identify existing opportunities for joint research
              efforts, new promising research areas, and to stimulate cooperation between US
              and Japanese researchers and Institutions.
