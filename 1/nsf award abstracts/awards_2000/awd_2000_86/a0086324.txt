Three special awards for outstanding astronomical
              research projects by high school students are awarded annually at the Intel
              International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF).

The awards are:

The
              Priscilla and Bart Bok awards (one award and one honorable mention) are awarded
              jointly by the American Astronomical Society (AAS) and the Astronomical Society
              of the Pacific (ASP).

The Richard D. Lines Special Award in Astronomy is
              awarded by the International Amateur-Professional Photoelectric Photometry
              (IAPPP).

Information on the details of the awards may be found at
              "http://www.aas.org/education/bok html". The winners are the subjects of a
              special article in the AAS newsletter each year.

In the year 2000, these
              honorary awards will be supplemented with a financial award, from the National
              Science Foundation, to be used by the recipients to further their education.  A
              modest sum will be awarded to their present school for use in enhancing science
              education. 

This award is funded by the Division of Astronomical
              Sciences.
