Abstract    :
              This project, carried out in close conjunction with the Software Engineering
              Research Center (SERC, an NSF-sponsored IUCRC Center), establishes a Software
              Engineering Technology Watch to track trends in Research, Technology, and the
              Market as relates to software engineering. The results of the these Watch
              activities-reports and studies-inform the respective communities about the
              state of the art, promising directions, and apparent failures.  As part of
              laying the foundation for the modeling of trends, data is compiled on various
              aspects of the national software engineering enterprise.  Example case studies
              would be the Internet, the Web, Java, Unix, Ada, and Linux. The activity also
              serves to define and refine the best strategies for collecting, analyzing, and
              disseminating the information, thus providing a feasibility study to determine
              the process to follow.  Issues to address include:  What cost factors guide
              trends, What lifecycle do technologies follow, and What aspects of technology
              evolution are controllable? The research develops a synthetic model of a
              "technology trend," a synthetic comparative survey of other existing tech-watch
              initiatives in software engineering, an identification of relevant indices and
              sources of information, and a report including factual information pertaining
              to the evolution of the field.
