This is a U.S.-Polish collaborative research project
              on electrodynamics in organic molecular solids.  The principal investigator is
              Dr.  Janice Musfeldt from the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.  Her Polish
              collaborator is Dr. Iwona Olejniczak from the Institute of Molecular Physics of
              the Polish Academy of Sciences in Poznan.

The researchers will investigate
              the polarized infrared and optical spectra of several chemically similar
              ET-based materials as a function of temperature and high magnetic field. 
              Through this research they expect to provide further information on chemical
              and physical tuning in organic molecular solids. 

This project in materials
              research fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts
              in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and
              capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of
              equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.
