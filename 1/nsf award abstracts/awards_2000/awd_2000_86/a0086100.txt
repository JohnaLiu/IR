Abstract    :
              This pilot project is building both a technical infrastructure that facilitates
              user discovery of and access to collections of diverse digital material for a
              national digital library for SMET Education, and a strong social foundation for
              the digital library that provides for its members a voice for their vision, an
              equitable governance structure, and opportunities for community leadership.
              Project activities build on the geoscience community's experiences to date in
              conceptualizing and laying the organizational and managerial foundation for a
              Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE). A suite of tools and
              services is also being developed to support member collections and help them
              achieve interoperability. Key partners in this aspect of the project include
              the San Diego Supercomputer Center and the Alexandria Digital Library project
              at the University of California - Santa Barbara. Examples include protocols for
              cross-collection searching; central services for persistent storage,
              authentication, and related needs; and tools that aid in materials
              classification and discovery, end-user support, and usage monitoring.
              Recognizing the importance of this effort to the larger science, mathematics,
              engineering, and technology education enterprise, the NSF Geosciences
              Directorate is providing significant co-funding for this project.
