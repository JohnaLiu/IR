Abstract    :
              Over a two year period, the research will focus on Biosurface Contact and
              Bioadhesion Studies Using Atomic Force Microscopy, using fungal spores.  Other
              aspects of the research will address monocyte and hepatocyte adhesion to
              reference substrata.  Surface characterization expertise at UB will supplement
              the research performed by Towson and Frostburg undergraduates and faculty. 
              IUCB colleagues at the U.S. Army Biotechnology Program and at the US FDA
              Division of Mechanics and Materials also will participate in the program.

In
              addition to providing quantitative, time dependent evaluations of hepatocyte,
              monocyte, and fungal spore attachment strengths to different substrata, this
              study will produce techniques that can be applied to other applications
              involving cell and/or particle adhesion.  These techniques could be applied to
              the dental and medical industries, as well as environmental health issues of
              the paint and xerography industies.
