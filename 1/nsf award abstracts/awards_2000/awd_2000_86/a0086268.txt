Abstract    :
              The biochemical molecules and processes on which life depends are exquisitely
              sensitive to the acid-base state, or pH, of their fluid environment. Mammals
              are known to regulate this fluid environment with great precision near pH 7.4.
              Although they have not been directly measured, the PIs assume that small
              mammals (less than 50 grams) regulate their acid-base state like larger
              mammals. However, Dr. Szewczak's laboratory has developed microsurgical and
              small blood volume techniques that have enabled acid-base measurement in small
              mammals, and their efforts indicate that small mammals regulate their pH at 7.3
              and less. The PIs plan to investigate the acid-base state in a variety of
              mammals as small as seven grams to explore whether this is a general regulatory
              strategy of mammals at this scale.

Although this may seem like a small
              change in pH, it is sufficient to significantly alter biochemical processes.
              Because the earliest known mammals from the Triassic Period weighed 20-30
              grams, this may provide essential clues for understanding mammalian organism
              and macromolecular evolution. This also has broad implications to many
              biological investigations because small mammals are so often the source for
              living materials used in laboratory preparations for tissue culture and
              biochemical investigations. Such preparations are adjusted to an assumed pH of
              7.4, which could significantly alter function from a correct pH of 7.3 or less.
              Thus many standard laboratory protocols may require adjustment, and the results
              of many prior studies may require reconsideration.
