Abstract    :
              The Georgia Tech Student and Teacher Enhancement Partnership (STEP)
              Program
partners Graduate Fellows from the Colleges of Sciences, Engineering
              and Computing with metro-Atlanta area high school SMET teams that are led by
              master science or mathematics teacher-coordinators. The program seeks to
              improve the teaching-related communication, and leadership skills of Georgia
              Tech graduate students, and to use the exceptional scholarly expertise
              available at Georgia Tech to assist in increasing the mathematics and science
              performance of Atlanta-area school students. STEP Fellows will participate in
              summer training workshops to familiarize them with inquiry-based learning
              pedagogy, classroom management and effective teaching skills, and appropriate
              uses of educational technologies. They will also work with high school
              personnel to develop a needs assessment and action plan for the school. During
              the school year they will work in pairs with their partner school, choosing
              activities from a menu of options that includes: 1) Student instruction, 2)
              Teacher professional development, 3) Student enrichment and mentoring, 4)
              Implementation of classroom websites, 5) Science fair project assistance, and
              6) Georgia Tech lab tours. The program will be open, by competitive
              application, to all of the nearly 3,000 graduate students in the Georgia Tech
              Colleges of Engineering, Sciences, and Computing.
