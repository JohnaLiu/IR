Abstract    :
              0086747  Anderson   The objective of this research is to establish the potential
              for enhanced aquifer bioremediation under anaerobic conditions by means of
              electochemically mediated electron transfer. The research will evaluate
              electrochemically-based mechanisms of 1) hydrocarbon oxidation by continuous
              electron acceptor supply via oxidation of an added electron shuttling compound
              in an electrochemical cell, 2) hydrocarbon oxidation via electrochemical
              oxidation of naturally-occurring electron shuttling compounds within aquifer
              sediments and 3) hydrocarbon oxidation via direct electrode reduction by
              contaminant-degrading microorganisms found in contaminated aquifer sediments. 
              Contaminated aquifers contain naturally-occurring electron shuttling compounds
              suggesting that the anaerobic subsurface could function as the working
              compartment of an electrochemical cell.  Direct microbial reduction of the
              working electrode is also possible in poised electrochemical cells with an
              externally applied voltage.  Electrochemical cells small enough to be placed
              into existing wells or into aquifers directly could provide a continual source
              of electron acceptors for organic contaminate oxidation.  Such devices would
              stimulate natural attenuation processes occurring within the subsurface, while
              requiring low power input and minimal maintenance, and they could be configured
              to provide a record of current production in order to monitor degradation
              processes in situ. This grant is made pursuant to Solicitation NSF 00-49, New
              Technologies for the Environment. ***
