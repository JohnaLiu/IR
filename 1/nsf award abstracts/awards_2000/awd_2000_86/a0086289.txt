Abstract    :
              For the past five years, the AMS has provided developing contries with the
              Journal of Climate and Monthly Weather Review  The program has been extremely
              successful in providing background materials for the scientists in those
              countries so that they can be part of the international policy dialogue on
              environmental issues.  As a matter of national policy, the United States is
              committed to build the scientific infrastructure of the developing nations.  As
              a result, NOAA's Office of Global Programs and the National Science Foundation
              have continued to provide the support for this significant endeavor.  The
              support has enabled the AMS to provide these two important jornals to 175
              organizations.  They are expanding the program this year by asking NASA's
              Office of Earth Science and the Navy's Oceanographic Office to join the effort.
