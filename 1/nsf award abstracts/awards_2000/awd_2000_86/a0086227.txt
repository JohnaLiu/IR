Abstract    :
              The project will build on established activities exploring new modes and
              mechanism for scholarly communication.  In particular, the project will draw on
              existing efforts of the Networked Digital 
Library of Theses and Dissertations
              (NDLTD) and the Open Archives Initiative (OAI).  The NDLTD promotes student
              production and submission of their own electronic theses and dissertations - in
              many 
different natural languages.  This project will pursue metadata
              standards and tool building for searching the distributed, multilingual,
              large-scale collection.  The collaboration with the University of Oldenburg
              will focus on PhysNet, an existing service which collects physics papers and
              scholarly materials from the Web
