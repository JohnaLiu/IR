Abstract    :
              A two-week workshop workshop/short course will be held at the University of
              Washington, Friday Harbor August 20th -September 3rd, 2000. The course will
              acquaint students with a modeling approach and software in the context of how
              biologists can use such tools to explore the evolutionary potential of
              developmental mechanisms. The first half of the course will cover background
              information that is crucial to young investigators working in the evolution of
              development (EvoDevo). This will include: major conceptual issues in
              evolutionary theory; evidence of evolvability from analysis of fossils and
              morphology; use of sequence data to infer phylogeny; and paradigms of
              developmental mechanics (i.e. networks of interacting genes). The second half
              will focus on modeling gene networks and the use of Ingeneue to do
              so.

Molecular biology is providing ever more detailed maps of developmental
              mechanisms as a first step in understanding development. The problem is,
              however, that these maps are so complex that even when a network is known well,
              human intuition and language cannot predict or even comprehend its dynamic
              behavior. The informed, careful use of computer models can help complete maps
              of gene networks, test the plausibility of those maps as explanations and
              direct efforts toward inconsistencies among the known facts. This course is a
              first step in providing biologists with a minimum of training in the use of
              software towards that end.
