Until recently, a fundamental understanding of how to control
              the position and strength of the two-photon absorption peak or organic
              molecules was lacking.  However, this group has now developed
              structure-property guidelines that allow for the systematic control of these
              factors.  This has resulted in new chromophores with high fluorescence quantum
              yields and unprecedented two-photon absorption cross sections (delta) in
              organic solvents.  The principal investigators have been working closely and
              with Professor Watt Webb of Cornell to understand the design requirements for
              chromophores for a variety of biological labeling applications to be
              implemented with two-photon fluorescence laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM). 
              This has provided this team with insight into dealing with problems that have
              been encountered with existing chromophores, such as low sensitivities and
              bleaching.
