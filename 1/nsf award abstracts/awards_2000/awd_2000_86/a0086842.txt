Abstract    :
              0086842  Nyman  The objective of this collaborative research project is to test
              the feasibility of pretreating contaminated sediments and dredge spoils such
              that rapid and complete microbial degradation can occur.  As one panelist
              commented, such materials have heretofore been relegated to the "impossible to
              deal with" category; hence, should the results of this feasibility study prove
              to be positive, an option for reducing the environmental impact of these
              materials prior to land filling or return to the environment will exist.  The
              contaminated materials will be contacted with organic acid and peroxide.  The
              former will prompt contaminant desorption whilst the latter will initiate the
              breakdown of the high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic contaminants to
              simpler molecules that bacteria can degrade.  Following the pretreatment and
              neutralization, microbial degradation will be used to complete the waste
              treatment.  The second step can, for example, be initiated with
              microbe-containing material from a municipal composting operation thereby
              providing for the integration of different waste treatment processes.  This
              grant is made pursuant to Solicitation NSF 00-49, New Technologies for the
              Environment.***
