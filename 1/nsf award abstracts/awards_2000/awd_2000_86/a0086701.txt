Abstract    :
              The proposed NM-AGEP is designed to triple the number of SME graduate minority
              students pursuing doctoral degrees and entering the professoriate over the next
              five years at the three NM-AGEP Universities through the following objectives:
              (a) coordinating efforts to support minority SME graduate students statewide,
              (b ) increasing the recruitment, retention and graduation of minority doctoral
              students in SME and supporting those students in pursuing academic careers, and
              ( c) institutionalizing a graduate education cultural climate that is receptive
              and supportive of a diverse graduate student population.
