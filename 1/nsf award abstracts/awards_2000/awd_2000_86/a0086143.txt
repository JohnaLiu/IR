Abstract    :
              This project will coordinate several efforts to test competing theories and
              hypotheses about the Internet's impact on society, including functional
              equivalence and time displacement, declining social capital, classic innovation
              diffusion, and reconfigured social networks. This work will be carried out in
              three ways:

1) Enhancing an interactive statistical website at the
              University of Maryland (www.bsos.umd.edu/webuse) that would make publicly
              available on-line the latest national data sets (from both the U.S. and other
              countries), research articles and research findings related to Internet use and
              its possible impact; 

2) Having up to 50 graduate and undergraduate students
              from across the country participate in a multi-week Summer Webshop in which
              they discuss with leading research scholars current theories, hypothesis and
              expectations concerning the Internet; and

3) Undertaking new data
              collections to address controversies or missing variables in existing data
              sets. The major vehicle for this purpose is the General Social Survey (GSS),
              which has been monitoring social change for the past 27 years and for which a
              new Internet module was included in the year 2000 GSS. 

This project will
              educate young researchers in studies of Information Technology. It will make
              available new national data sets for dissertations and other research studies.
              And it will extend and refine the GSS to include questions on Internet impact
              and use.
