Abstract    :
              The Division of International Programs and the Division of Chemistry support
              Hannes Jonsson for a workshop on "Simulations of Long Time Scale Dynamics: 
              Molecular and Continuum Descriptions" at the University of Reykjavik in
              Iceland.  The focus of the workshop is on new developments in simulations of
              atomic systems over long time scales and the coupling of atomistic simulations
              with continuum descriptions.  The workshop will bring together researchers who
              are approaching this problem from different perspectives with different tools
              and to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the various
              approaches.

Dynamical simulations such as those covered in this workshop
              have led to insight and understanding in many diverse areas such as materials
              design, drug discovery, and protein structure.  Current simulations are limited
              to extremely short time scales, about a nanosecond or less.  It is important to
              find ways to carry out molecular-level simulations on the much longer time
              scales of interest for applications in chemistry and materials science.
