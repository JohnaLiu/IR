This award supports Gopia Podila and students from the Michigan
              Technological University in a collaboration Robin Sen of the Department of
              Biology at the University of Helsinki, Finland.  The project will focus on the
              molecular characterization of cellular development and functioning processes in
              conifer ectomycorrhizae, which are symbiotic root-fungal organs essential for
              seedling establishment and tree growth in nutrient-limited soils.  The essence
              of the symbiosis is that the fungus provides roots with needed nitrogen and
              phosphorus in exchange for carbon at the root-fungus interface.  A deeper
              understanding of the functional genomics of the symbiosis is an essential part
              of forest science and has considerable potential in future forest biotechnology
              applications the U.S. and Finland.  Each lab brings unique equipment and
              expertise to the research, and the collaboration is a perfect match for
              advancing fundamental knowledge of the molecular bases of ectomycorrhizal
              symbiosis.  Exchange of junior researchers is emphasized to add an
              international dimension to their training and to allow them to establish
              international connections early in their careers.
