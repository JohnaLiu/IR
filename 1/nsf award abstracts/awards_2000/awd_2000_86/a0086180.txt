Abstract    :
              The project would build upon the on-going activities undertaken through the
              TCRSI, which centered around schools on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation
              that straddles North and South Dakota. The work will be accomplished through
              avenues such as professional development workshops and guidance, collaboration
              with the school systems involved in the project, and active participation and
              leadership by Sitting Bull College to facilitate change, direct delivery of
              services, and restructuring its own math and science programs.
