Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for the symposium entitled "Organic Thin
              Films for Photonic Applications" to be held at the ACS National Meeting,
              Washington, D.C., August 20-25, 2000.  The organizers wish to have broad
              international representation and to have participation by both acknowledged
              leaders and promising newcomers to this field.  A special effort is made to
              support and include junior faculty amongst the invited speakers and to promote
              contributions from graduate students and postdocs.

The primary sponsor of
              the sponsor of the symposium is the Division of Polymeric Materials Science  &
              Engineering (PMSE) of the American Chemical Society (ACS) with secondary
              sponsorship by the Division of Polymer Chemistry (POLY) of the SCS and the
              Optical Society of America (OSA).  The principal objective of this symposium is
              to promulgate the science and technology of organic and polymeric materials
              with novel and useful optical and electronic properties.  This symposium is
              designed to bring together organic chemists, polymer scientists, optical
              physicists and device specialists to discuss materials science capabilities and
              photonic and optoelectronic device requirements so that their combined efforts
              may lead to new advances.
