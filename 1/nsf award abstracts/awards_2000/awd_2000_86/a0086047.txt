Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a two-year collaborative project between the NSF
              Industry/University Cooperative Research Center in Ergonomics at Texas A&M
              University and Professor Arun Garg from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. 
              The purpose of this proposal is to expand the intellectual capital of selected
              research projects at the Ergonomics I/UCRC through Dr. Garg's participation in
              several research projects.  Dr. Garg will contribute to these projects by
              interacting with the students, faculty, and industrial partners on the design,
              analysis and interpretation of the selected studies.  The expected outcome of
              the proposed collaboration would include higher quality research in ergonomics
              at the Center which should enhance the Center's reputation both in the
              scientific community as well as in industry.
