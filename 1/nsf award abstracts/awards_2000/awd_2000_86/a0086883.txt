Abstract    :
              0086883  Love  The objective of this research is to explore the phenomenon and
              sensor applications of cation release from bacteria.  Upon exposure to chemical
              toxins, bacteria release potassium ions.  These ions, in turn, can generate a
              detectable optical signal when they interact with fluorophores that are
              incorporated into polymeric films.  This project will investigate the
              physiology and kinetics of ion release in more detail.  Additionally, a
              prototype toxic indicator device that integrates immobilized bacteria and
              optical sensing will be developed in collaboration with the Chemical Science
              and Technology Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and
              Technology.  This grant is made pursuant to Solicitation NSF 00-49, New
              Technologies for the Environment.***
