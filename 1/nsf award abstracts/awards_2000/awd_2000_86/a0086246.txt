"NStars: Model Atmospheres and Spectral Analyses
              of Nearby T/L/M Dwarfs"


Dr. Hauschildt is working on a series of projects
              designed to better understand the structure of cool stellar and 'brown dwarf'
              atmospheres.  Many such objects are being discovered in the solar neighborhood.
               An existing model stellar atmosphere code PHOENIX is being improved to compute
              the emitted spectra of very cool atmospheres.  The project is focussed on
              several key areas:  (1) incorporation of molecular processes into the existing
              code;  (2) treatment of the effects of companion star illumination on cool
              atmospheres;  (3) the effects of grain condensation and cloud formation;  (4)
              creation of a grid of predicted emergent fluxes for cool stellar and
              sub-stellar atmospheres;  and (5) direct comparison of the computed spectra
              with observed spectra of M-, L-, and T-dwarf stars and brown dwarfs.
Funding
              for this project was provided by the NSF Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics 
              (AST/SAA) program through the joint NSF/NASA "Nearby Stars (NStars)"
              initiative, and the NSF Mathematical & Physical Sciences Directorate Office of
              Multidisciplinary Activities (MPS/OMA).
