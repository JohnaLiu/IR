Abstract    :
              Climate in northern regions is expected to change dramatically in the coming
              decades.  Climate research has developed tools to predict long-range change and
              to evaluate the uncertainty in these predictions.  It is possible that these
              research products could potentially play a role in regional and local decision
              making.  However, communities may have alternate approches to dealing with
              climate events and climate change, approaches that may not link to predicitive
              research products.  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research would conduct
              interviews and small conferences with residents of the Alaskan North Slope
              communities.  These gatherings will be used (1) to evaluate the understanding
              by individuals within these communities about climate events, (2) to determine
              what policies or actions they take to adapt to or mitigate climate events, and
              (3) to examine whether their culture institutions can incorporate predictive
              research products.
