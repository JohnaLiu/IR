The American Academy of Microbiology requests partial
              support from NSF to convene a colloquium, entitled "Geobiology: Exploring the
              Interface Between the Geosphere and the Biosphere," to be held November
              30-December 3, 2000, in Tucson, Arizona. This colloquium will deliberate the
              relationships of the microbial world to the geosphere and the biosphere from
              several perspectives. The field will be defined in breadth and scope. A list of
              urgent scientific questions will be the basis for in-depth analysis of the
              intellectual, economic, and social  issues. Technological, educational, and
              communication issues also will be addressed, along with specific scientific
              problems. The results will be summarized in a comprehensive report to serve as
              guidelines for future development of the field.
