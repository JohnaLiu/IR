Abstract    :
              An NSF-CBMS Regional Conference in the Mathematical SCiences entitled, "New
              Horizons in Multiple Comparison Procedures" will be held during August 13 - 17,
              2001 at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA.  Professor Yosef Hochberg of Tel
              Aviv University, Israel, a leading researcher in the area of multiple
              comparisons, is the principal lecturer who will deliver a series of ten
              lectures covering some of the most important recent advances in multiple
              comparisons.   Ample time will be provided after each lecture for informal
              discussions, and one-hour talks willbe given by each of a number of additional
              speakers.  A major focus of the conference will be opportunities for students
              and new researchers, particularly those from the Philadelphia area, to engage
              in dialogues with established researchers to gain a deeper understanding of
              newer ideas in multiple comparisons.  The funds requested will be to support
              the participation of about ten established and fifteen younger researchers
              having credentials in the area of multiple comparisons, with an emphasis on
              those from traditionally underrepresented groups.
