This
              is the proposed continuation of a research supported by NSF for the last six
              years.  Its objective is to obtain a good quantitative understanding of the
              flow particle suspensions (fluidization), including some of its main
              characteristics (Reynolds stresses, granular temperature, bubbles and particle
              size).  The challenge is to add to the traditional conservation equations for
              each phase and particle type, the phenomenological properties of the mixtures
              involved (e.g. viscosity).  With this information, it was shown early in this
              research that it is possible to generate a predictive theory with a more
              accurate and detailed description of the flow.  A number of experiments (seven)
              are proposed to establish the necessary phenomenological constants for
              different multiphase mixtures: gas-solid, gas-liquid-solids, bubbling beds.
