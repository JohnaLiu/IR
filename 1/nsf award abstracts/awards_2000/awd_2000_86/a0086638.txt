The goal
              of this project is to study supported metal particle catalysis and to
              understand the influence of metal electronic properties for control of carbene
              coupling and hydrogenation reactions.  An important element is the synthesis of
              both metallic catalytic precursor materials and the clean carbene sources.  To
              test hypotheses that have been predicted with respect to electronic properties,
              a number of kinetics and spectroscopic measurements will be carried out.  The
              chemical reaction kinetics of hydrogen dissociation, carbene coupling, and
              carbene hydrogenation will be measured.  Diazomethane and difluorodiazirine
              will be synthesized and used to provide a clean source of carbenes so that the
              elementary steps can be probed directly.  The experiments outlined should lead
              to a greater fundamental understanding of the way in which carbenes combine or
              hydrogenate on various transition-metal and alloy catalysts.  This work may
              lead to the development and understanding of catalytic systems that are
              effective for chlorine removal and for the production of useful chemicals.
