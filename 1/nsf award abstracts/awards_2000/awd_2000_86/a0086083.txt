Abstract    :
              The principal lecturer for this CBMS series on Environmental Statistics will be
              Richard Smith from the University of North Carolina, and the series will take
              place at the University of Washington, in conjunction with the National
              Research Center for Statistics and the Environment.  The lectures will cover
              topics in geostatistics, nonstationary models, lattice models, spatio-temporal
              models, monitoring network design, time series, trend detection, and extreme
              values, with motivation for each topic drawn from environmental applications.
