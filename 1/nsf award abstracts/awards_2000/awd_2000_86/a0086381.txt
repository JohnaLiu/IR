Abstract    :
              The investigators will develop a new spaced-radar technique to study coupling
              processes and energetics taking place in the equatorial electrojet.  With this
              technique, it will be possible to measure the complete altitude profile of the
              electric field in the electrojet as a function of time.  The technique is based
              on a well-established technique that uses the Doppler velocity of radar echoes
              from the electrojet measured at two or more locations.  The two radars will be
              located on the islands of  Pohnpei and Majuro.  The data will be used to study
              the electrical current in the electrojet, the sources of variability in the
              electrojet, and the role of gravity waves in modifying the electrojet.
