Abstract    :
              Various K-12 educational programs have been developed by University of Puerto
              Rico, Mayaguez Campus, which coherently couple motivation, orientation,
              training, and follow-up activities of K-12 teachers and students with
              undergraduate, graduate, and university professors.  Among them are the
              programs enclosed in the Earth Science Initiative: Science on Wheels, GLOBE
              (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment), SCBL (Sensors
              and Calculator-Based Laboratory) and the Geology Outreach. University graduate
              and undergraduate students are already a significant part of the training
              activities
resulting in a favorable model for the development and motivation
              of future science and engineering professionals and pre-college teachers.
              Therefore, the GUEST K-12 (Graduate and Undergraduate Students Enhancing
              Science and Technology in K-12 Schools) program proposes to coordinate and
              reinforce the partnership between the university and K-12 schools by funding
              highly qualified undergraduate (four) and graduate (sixteen) students to serve
              as resources in the pre-college classroom. This initiative will be coupled to
              existing K-12 outreach programs and will benefit more than three hundred
              teachers and over ten thousand students. The GUEST K-12 program will transform
              precollege teachers into science and technology proficient educators while
              fellows will improve communication and teaching-related skills.  This award is
              co-supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate
              for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
