Abstract    :
              The research will increase knowledge of tropical cyclone activity by
              systematically investigating high latitude linkages to tropical cyclone and
              hurricane activity. The goals are (i) to identify and predict the most
              important components of US interannual hurricane variability; and (ii) to
              describe and predict annual to decadal variability of US hurricane landfall
              probabilities conditioned on climate anomalies. A new dynamic probability model
              will be used to answer 'what if' questions concerning the regional likelihood
              of hurricanes conditioned on large-scale climate anomalies. The method of
              empirical orthogonal teleconnections will be modified to describe and predict
              the dominant covariability patterns of hurricanes along the US coastline.
              Factor analysis and change-point models will also be used. The PI and his group
              have made several breakthroughs in understanding hurricane and typhoon activity
              as it relates to climate. The essential theme has been that space-time
              variability in tropical cyclone activity is related to climate processes
              operating both within and outside the Tropics. The work is important because
              the perspective that extratropical climate anomalies play an important role in
              modulating tropical cyclone activity is new, and has the potential to
              significantly alter understanding of global climate processes.
