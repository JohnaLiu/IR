Abstract    :
              Measurements of aerosol backscatter at two wavelengths, ozone concentration,
              relative humidity, and temperature will be obtained from balloons up to
              altitudes of 30 km, providing high resolution vertical profiles. Monthly
              flights will be carried out from Natal, Brazil. These measurements will serve
              to define the natural aerosol background and identify perturbations occurring
              throughout the free troposphere. These measurements will add information on a
              very undersampled region and provide the opportunity to study sources of
              aerosols in the tropics, their transport, and radiative impact.
