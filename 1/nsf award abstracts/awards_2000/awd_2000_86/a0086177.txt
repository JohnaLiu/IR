Abstract    :
              The proposed work would build upon the pilot activities undertaken through the
              TCRSI, which centered around schools in two.  The focus of the proposed work is
              curricular alignment with technology integration.  UTTC is a leader in distance
              instruction and instructional technology for the tribal colleges in the state. 
              

The conduct of the project will be under the guidance of an Advisory
              Council, composed of parents, teachers, administrators, students and corporate
              partners.  The works will be accomplished through avenues such as improved
              pedagogy, improved content, standards-based materials, integration of
              technology into instruction, professional development workshops and training,
              and the use of technology resource teachers.
