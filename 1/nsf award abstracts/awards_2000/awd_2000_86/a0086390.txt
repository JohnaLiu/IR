Abstract    :
              
Through the unique partnering of Engineering and Education Graduate Fellows,
              Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science, Teachers
              College, Barnard College, and New York City School Districts will create a
              comprehensive model of teacher recruitment and education that is
              a

significant departure from traditional pre-service and in-service teacher
              training programs. The long-term objective of this program is to create a
              sustainable teacher-training model that significantly infuses technology-
              competent teachers into urban school systems.
The proposed fellowship project
              has as its major goal to develop a unique pre-service and in-service teaching
              model that has the following program elements:

o   the creation of an
              innovative, interdisciplinary education program that seamlessly integrates new
              educational technologies into their curriculum and capitalizes on a large pool
              of technology-savvy undergraduate and graduate engineering, science, math, and
              education students;

o   the collaboration of Columbia University's Fu
              Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS), Barnard College,
              and Teachers College (TC) with Community School Districts and High Schools in
              Harlem to share institutional resources, experience and expertise;

o   the
              organization of parallel college and secondary school technology environments
              for the training of teachers in academic and real world school settings;

o  
              the development and organization of curriculum modules in the sciences and
              mathematics that enable the full use of computer technology and the Internet to
              foster learning through self-directed study and group project applications;
              and

o   the demonstration and assessment of the impact a
              technology-integrated learning environment has on secondary students' science
              and math knowledge and skills.
The project's concept is to build the
              infrastructure and formal mechanisms required to develop the technology and
              pedagogical skills of graduate and undergraduate engineering, science, and math
              students to prepare them for careers in urban secondary schools systems.
              Engineering and Education Graduate Fellows, as partners, will be responsible
              for the creation of educational technology laboratories located at Columbia and
              School District #5, the development of technology-enhanced curriculum modules
              in support of secondary school student learning in science and math, direct
              mentoring of secondary school students, and the supervision of undergraduate
              teaching students during a junior year technology-focused field experience.
              Throughout the project, the fellows will participate in a series of special
              workshops and mentoring experiences to support the development of their
              teaching knowledge and skills.
