The
              Gordon Conference on Catalysis in 2000 will be held on June 25-30 in New
              London, New Hampshire.  The conference will focus on several areas that are key
              to the fundamental understanding of catalytic systems: molecular level
              characterization of catalysts, quantitative descriptions of reaction pathways,
              novel materials and the accelerated development of catalysts, electrocatalysis,
              chiral catalysis, and the production of ultralow sulfur fuels.  The themes and
              speakers are of interest to both academic and industrial communities.  Current
              and future trends in heterogeneous catalysis will be the general theme.  This
              grant will provide partial support for speakers, graduate students,
              post-doctoral students, and younger faculty.  This support will permit a more
              comprehensive discussion and dissemination of the material.
