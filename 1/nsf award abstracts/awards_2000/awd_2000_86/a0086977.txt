Special
              Projects: Student Fellow Support for the ACM Conference on Universal
              Usability

On November 16 and 17, 2000 the ACM Conference on Universal
              Usability is being held in Washington, D.C.  The conference seeks to promote
              research that will enable the widest possible range of users to benefit from
              information technologies.  These user groups include ethnic minorities, women,
              and those who are physically, intellectually, educationally or financially
              challenged.  The aim of this research is to enable them to participate in
              communication, online education, online health care, e-commerce and government
              services via the Internet.  The goal of this project is to support and train
              students from these designated groups (and others who have strong skills and
              experience in assisting individuals from these groups) about potential research
              opportunities in universal usability by involving them in the conference, its
              planning and the dissemination of ideas and initiatives arising from the
              conference.  The grant will provide partial support for ten graduate students
              and ten seniors and juniors to work with the conference committee, participate
              in planning, attend the conference, disseminate research ideas and develop a
              web site.
