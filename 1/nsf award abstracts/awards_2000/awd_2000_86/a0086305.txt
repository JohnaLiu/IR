Abstract    :
              
The purpose of this workshop is to enhance the cooperation among various
              control groups and high school teachers of mathematics and science throughout
              the United States and the world, to give attention to control and systems ideas
              and technology, and to increase the general awareness of the importance of
              control and systems technology and its cross-disciplinary nature among high
              school teachers and students.

Control and Systems Science occurs in many
              different disciplines and its applications occur in a wide variety of
              technologies. It involves a variety of tasks, such as, modeling,
              identification, simulation, planning, decision making, and
              optimization.

Some application areas of control and systems include
              transportation, manufacturing, communications, processing industries, and
              financial markets. The basic control systems science influences and impacts a
              diverse range of study, such as, biology, physics, chemistry, economics, and
              medicine.
