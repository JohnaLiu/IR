This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will enable the
              applicant to film an expedition of Mexican and American scientists who will go
              to Isla Guadalupe, 160 miles off the coast of Baja California.  From June 3
              through June 11, 2000 the expedition will investigate the status of land and
              sea bird species, study the insect and arthropod populations, survey the
              plants, search for secretive reptiles and amphibians, monitor the effects of
              overgrazing, and prescribe needed conservation measures for the island.  In
              conjunction with this expedition, there will be the first ever visit by humans
              to an offshore islet that remains undisturbed.  The period in June when the
              expedition will be there is when the Storm-Petrel, a species some think to be
              extinct, would most predictably occupy this breeding ground.  

The
              expedition, itself, is partially supported by a Small Grant for Exploratory
              Research from the Biology Directorate at NSF.  The request to the Informal
              Science Education Program is for support to a small film crew to document the
              expedition.  The footage obtained would be jointly owned by The San Diego
              Natural History Museum and North Lights Production, the film production
              partner.  Subsequent to the expedition, potential uses of the film include full
              production of a one-hour documentary for national broadcast (interest has
              already been expressed by National Geographic), as well as production of a
              video for use in formal education and by museums.
