Abstract    :
              The Turtle Mountain Rural Systemic Initiative proposal for Phase II proposes
              that the Turtle Mountain Community College coordinate continues systemic reform
              of the K-12 schools in the reservation area.  These schools include: Dunseith
              Day School, Dunseith Public Elementary School, Dunseith High School, Ojibwa
              Elementary School, Turtle Mountain Elementary School, Turtle Mountain Middle
              School and Turtle Mountain High School.

Objectives

1. Sustain
              professional development of staffs of Turtle Mountain schools as a year-round
              endeavor.
2. Institutionalize the process for continually reviewing, revising
              and implementing standards-based curriculum in all classrooms in each school
              engaging the teachers in alternative assessments.
3. Establishing teacher
              learning communities headed by lead teacher to continue to improve instruction
              in SMET areas.
4. Put in place policy mandates supporting high quality SMET at
              all levels of each system.
5. Sustain a resource network for continuing
              organizational improvement in SMET areas.
6. Disseminate success via a
              conference involving stakeholders in SMET to demonstrate gains in student
              achievement for traditionally underserved populations.

Methods

The TMRSI
              will institutionalize the ongoing annual Teacher Enhancement Institute
              pre-school year training session providing graduate credits for area teachers. 
              TMCC's newly constructed main campus will become its permanent site.  To
              support continued staff renewal, a teacher learning community program will be
              implemented in which lead teachers will identified and trained to conduct staff
              improvement clinics for their fellow teachers in SMET areas.  TMRSI will assist
              area schools in obtaining consultants to help systematically acquaint them with
              varied alternative assessment methods and to conduct one pilot project in
              alternative assessment in area schools.  TMRSI will work with policy makers to
              shape mandates including reserved inservice days for improved SMET education. 
              Rational budget forecasting, leveraging funds from external resource providers,
              and implementing and annual SMET conference will also sustain the momentum of
              system reform from Phase I.
