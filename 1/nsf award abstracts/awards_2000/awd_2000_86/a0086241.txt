Title:  Collaborative Research: Integrating Logic in the
              Computer Science Curriculum

This CISE Educational Innovation (EI) proposal
              requests funds to develop a series of modules that seamlessly integrate logic
              and logic-based software tools into existing, widely taught computer science
              (CS) courses.  Few undergraduate computer science curricula prepare students
              adequately in logic.  The typical student sees a few weeks of truth tables and
              propositional logic in discrete practical work.  These modules would allow CS
              departments to easily modify their curricula to rectify this situation.  By
              supplying modules, complete with lecture notes, presentations, problem sets,
              and tools, the investigators hope to facilitate curricular treatment of applied
              logic at all levels of college education, particularly in CS departments with
              scarce resources.  This project has the potential to have a major impact on the
              way that CS is taught.
