Abstract    :
              This project would conduct Development-phase activities such as the regional
              self-study, to collect and analyze data aligned with the Systemic Reform
              Drivers.  The data and the associated discussions, resulting in stronger
              partnerships between stakeholders, will be used to formulate the strategies for
              the Implementation phase.  

The project will be conducted by a group termed
              the Proposal Development Team (PDT) and the Comprehensive Planning Committee
              (CPC) who represent each state.  The goals of the project are:

Develop a
              structure to gather baseline data about the status of math/science education in
              the targeted region.
Use the data to develop intervention strategies for the
              region and for each district.
Research models of best practices for rural
              systemic reform.
Further the partnerships.
Develop and articulate a strategy
              for reform, submitted to the RSI Implementation competition.
