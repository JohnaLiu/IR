The Great Basin province is the largest, best-exposed, and
              most accessible region of continental extension in the world and accounts for
              up to 25% of the motion across the North American - Pacfic plate boundary. 
              Global Positioning Satellite GPS measurements operated by others are beginning
              to provide a picture of strain accumulation across the Basin.  It is the
              process of strain release that results in the structure, physiography, and the
              spatial and temporal pattern of earthquakes that define the Basin and Range as
              we observe it today.  Measures of both strain accumulation and strain release
              are required to understand the dynamics and evolution of deformation in the
              Basin and Range province.  Neotectonic and paleoseismic techniques are being
              applied to active faults that bound major mountain fronts that sit subparallel
              to the existing GPS transects and adjacent to the I-80 corridor of Nevada.  The
              paleoseismic studies are designed to quantify and compare the history and
              evolution of fault displacement through the late Quaternary to the pattern of
              strain accumulation that is being observed today.
