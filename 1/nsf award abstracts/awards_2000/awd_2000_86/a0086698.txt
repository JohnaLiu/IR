Abstract    :
              0086698   Chen   The objective of this research is the development and testing
              of high affinity, tunable biopolymers for the selective removal of heavy metals
              from aqueous streams.  In this research, tunable protein conjugates that have a
              high affinity for specific metals will be developed by starting with specific
              proteins associated with metal resistance in bacteria.  The proposed process
              uses genetically engineered proteins which posses functional groups or domains
              that: (1) chelate transition metal ions, and (2) change folding patterns in
              response to pH and temperature so that they can be rendered insoluble to remove
              the metals, and (3) can revert to a soluble form in response to pH and
              temperature to separate the polymer from the waste stream, e. g. tunable
              biopolymers.  This grant is made pursuant to Solicitation NSF 00-49, New
              Technologies for the Environment. ***
