Abstract    :
              0086755  Roberts  This research explores the use of zero-valent metals for
              treating vapor phase chlorinated organic contaminants commonly found in
              landfill gas.  Specifically, the reactions of 1,2-dichloroethane and
              cis-1,2-dichloroethane (and their daughter products) with a variety of
              bimetallic reductants (or iron alone) will be studied.  Batch and column tests
              will be conducted for screening and for determining performance, longevity, and
              reaction rates and products.  Additional studies will focus on developing a
              better understanding of the molecular-scale chemical reactions that result in
              destruction of halogenated contaminants at metal particle surfaces.  Batch and
              column studies will be complemented by surface chemical investigations,
              designed to provide information concerning trhe composistion of the reactive
              metal surface as it evolves under the influence of exposure to water,
              chlorinated contaminants and the minor gas-phase constituents, oxygen and
              hydrogen-sulfide.  In addition to the intended application to landfill gas,
              applications of this research include controlling emissions from chemical
              production and manufacturing processes, as well as treating contaminants
              present in soils (removed via soil vapor extraction or bioventing). This grant
              is made pursuant to Solicitation NSF 00-49, New Technologies for the
              Environment.***
