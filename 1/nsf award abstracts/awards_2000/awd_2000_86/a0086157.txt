This award will partially support the production of a
              documentary video that will be used as a high school/college teaching tool and
              will also be suitable for airing on public television.  The purpose of the
              video is to improve the public's perception of mathematics and thereby
              encourage an increased number of students to pursue careers in the mathematical
              sciences.  This will be accomplished by portraying the human side of
              mathematical discovery and creativity. This project is being supported by the
              Divisions of Astronomy, Materials Research, Mathematics, and Physics within the
              Directorate of Mathematics and Physical Sciences, and the Division of
              Elementary, Secondary, and Informal Education within the Directorate of
              Education and Human Resources.
