Abstract    :
              The proposed research will investigate new software engineering
techniques and
              tools for infrastructural software that will improve
its reliability, safety,
              and predictability.  The key idea is to use
abstract design models to drive
              new static analyses that check that
the software correctly implements its
              design (and if not, identify the
source of the problem).  To ensure that our
              research addresses the
important issues that developers face in the field, we
              will conduct
our research in the context of the development of an air
              traffic
control system component. Specifically, the research will
              investigate
the use of object models to express important design properties
              and
new pointer analysis algorithms to verify that the code
              correctly
implements the object models.  Object models describe essential
              object
in the heap and the relationships between them; pointer
              analysis
automatically analyzes code to extract information about how
              objects
refer to each other.  The research will investigate techniques
              that
improve the precision of the pointer analysis by using the object
model
              to focus the analysis on the properties of interest.
