An equipment award supports the fabrication of a tribology
              attachment for a MASIF (Measurement and Analysis of Surface Interactions and
              Forces) surface force apparatus.  The redesign and specification of the
              tribology attachment that has the requisite capabilities for both high
              precision lateral friction force measurements and in-situ laser spectroscopic
              analyses will be undertaken in collaboration with Australian Scientific
              Instruments.  The development of a fully working tribology attachment for use
              with the MASIF will result in a new type of molecular tribometer.  Its
              application in molecular tribology studies holds promise to significantly
              enhance the fundamental understanding of friction and wear, boundary
              lubrication and other tribological phenomena important to advanced
              materials.
