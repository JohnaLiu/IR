Abstract    :
              The University of Arizona and the University of Maryland are proposing the
              renewal of their successful joint Industry/University Cooperative Research
              Centers (I/UCRC), entitled "The Center for Optoelectronic Devices Interconnect
              and Packaging (COEDIP)" under the sponsorship of the National Science
              Foundation.  The Center was created five years ago to promote collaborative
              research between the two Universities and industries based on their strengths
              in the field of optoelectronics components, packaging and interconnection.  The
              major goals of the Center are:

- To promote collaboration and joint projects
              between the two universities;
- To transfer new technology developed within
              each university to their industrial partners; and
- To train highly qualified
              students and promote their interaction with industries.
