Abstract    :
              A Maine ScienceCorps Promoting Excellence and Equity in Ifigh School Biological
              Science Education
In partnership with high school biology teachers, a
              "ScienceCorps" of University of Southern Maine (USM) immunology and molecular
              biology graduate student fellows will bring laboratory and inquiry-based
              activities into underserved Maine classrooms while adding a focus upon inquiry
              methods of learning and teaching to their graduate curriculum. Students in
              chronically underfunded rural schools typically have inadequate access to
              laboratory facilities and the scientific world beyond the classroom.
              ScienceCorps extends the twenty-two year partnership of USM and the Foundation
              for Blood Research in enrichment of high school biological sciences education
              through programs of inquiry-based learning activities and laboratory
              experiences for students and teachers. ScienceWorksfor ME, an ongoing program
              providing summer institutes for teachers and students and hosting visiting high
              school bioloav classes for laboratory-based activities, provides the framework
              for much of the training that graduate fellows will need to serve effectively
              in high school biology classrooms. ScienceCorps teams, each consisting of two
              graduate fellows, will take activities developed and tested through
              ScienceWorks into rural high school classrooms across the state and will also
              work with skilled high school teachers in developing new activities that will
              facilitate these teachers'efforts to meet state and national science education
              standards.
