Abstract    :
              The goal of this project is to develop improved optimization techniques for use
              in three- and four-dimensional data assimilation in meteorology that will both
              reduce the computer time required in the assimilation process and increase the
              reliability of the results.  The research will consist of experimental work
              with existing assimilation codes, in conjunction with a theoretical study of
              both the optimization algorithms and the physical models.  The project
              represents a collaborative effort among Dr. Jorge Nocedal (Northwestern
              University), Dr. Stephen Wright (University of Chicago), and researchers at the
              National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).

The new optimization
              techniques include enriched limited memory quasi-Newton methods for minimizing
              the nonlinear cost functions, automatic preconditioners to accelerate the
              conjugate gradient method, and structured quasi-Newton methods of nonlinear
              least squares problems.  The new techniques will be designed for the case in
              which the background covariance matrix does not have a simple sparsity
              structure.  The techniques must also be robust when varying levels of
              resolution are used in the model during computation, a common situation with
              meteorological models.  Thus, a theoretical framework that quantifies the
              effects of these inaccuracies on the performance of the algorithms will have to
              be developed.

The Divisions of Atmospheric Sciences and Mathematical
              Sciences jointly support this project.
