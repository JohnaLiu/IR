"Feasibility
              Study of Scientific Communication in Africa and India"

This award supports
              an effort designed to collect baseline data and to establish the feasibility of
              a project assessing the role of the Internet for scientific communication in
              developing areas. The overall objective of the broader project is to determine
              the actual and potential impact of the web on scientific and technological
              communication in less developed areas through an examination of the conditions
              associated with interpersonal networking and information search behavior.
              Researchers in three areas with different levels of research capacity -- Ghana,
              Kenya, and India (Kerala) -- in two organizational contexts (academic,
              governmental) are the focus of the study. Currently, each of these areas is
              planning to introduce web-based communication capacity within their research
              systems. The objectives of this SGER project are:  (1) to provide a baseline
              survey of scientific communication immediately before the introduction of the
              web in the organizations where the larger study will be conducted; (2) to
              establish the viability of using local research resources to conduct the
              repeated surveys necessary for the broader project.
