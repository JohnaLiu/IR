Abstract

Achievement of steady or quasi-steady annular or
              stratified internal condensing flows in pipe (for any given inlet pressure,
              mass flow rate, and condensing surface temperature distribution) is dependent
              on compatibility between the condenser-section heat removal rate and exit
              pressure condition, or, equivalently, exit vapor flow rate fraction.  For
              certain exit conditions, quasi-steady wavy-interface flows are realized and,
              for other conditions, significant compressibility-induced oscillations will
              persist. These unresolved issues will be experimentally investigated with the
              help of electronic flow control techniques which assist in identifying the
              range of conditions for which quasi-steady flows are achievable for different
              exit conditions.  The experiment will also allow for novel observations and
              measurements for annular film condensation in 6.35 mm inner diameter pipe of
              0.8 m length.  The pipe, and subsequently channel, may operate from vertically
              downward to horizontal configurations.  We also propose to measure time-varying
              condensate film thickness by fluorescence technique applicable to boiling and
              condensing flows of doped di-electric refrigerants such as FC-72, etc. From
              these measurements, mean and wave-structure may be found.  Separate efforts
              relate the results of the proposed experimental research to computational
              simulations and applications such as Looped Heat Pipes, etc.
