Abstract    :
              Kean College of New Jersey is seeking support to replace the departmental's
              server and to purchase a portable classroom projection system to bring Unidata
              products directly into the classroom.  The present server is inadequate and has
              become unreliable to fulfill the demands requested by faculty and students. 
              With the new equipment, Kean will provide an opportunity for students to
              enhance their learning experience in and out of the classroom.  In addition,
              faculty and students will be able to share data and information with the
              Unidata community and surrounding K-12 institutions.
