This is a US-Mexico research project for a study in the
              field of experimental elementary particle physics.  The research will involve
              primarily the analysis of data already in existence, but also cooperation on
              the development of radiation hard pixel detectors for the proposed BteV
              experiments at Fermilab. This type of detector is probably the most rapidly
              developing and revolutionary type of detector used in Fermilab. 

The main
              goal of experiment E791 was to study charm decay Physics.  It provided a unique
              opportunity to study total and differential cross sections as functions of the
              incident particle species and target material.  However, the statistics
              available in E791 are some 50 times greater than in E769, and this new study
              aims to improve the cross section measurements for the so-called golden modes
              of charm.
