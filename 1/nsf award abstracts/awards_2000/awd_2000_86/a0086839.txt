Abstract    :
              0086839  Reardon  The objective of this research is to improve the efficacy of
              the in situ treatment of migrating plumes of contaminated ground water.  The
              engineering technologies to be developed and synergistically combined are (1)
              electrochemical alteration of the local redox environment and (2) enhanced
              biodegradation.  The envisioned implementation entails constructing a
              plume-intercept zone in which the augmented degradation of chlorinated
              pollutants (e.g. perchloroethene) occurs as ground water traverse the zone. 
              The augmented destruction of contaminants is an anticipated outcome for two
              reasons.  First, the reducing conditions generated at the cathodic surfaces
              inserted in the upstream side of the intercept zone will stimulate the
              development of bacterial populations that can dechlorinate the pollutants. 
              Second, the oxidizing conditions generated in the down stream section of the
              zone in conjunction with the dechlorinated state of the pollutants will lead to
              accelerated mineralization.  This grant is made pursuant to Solicitation NSF
