The goal of this project is to understand atomistic
              processes involved in the constrained sintering of multilayered ceramic films
              and the mechanical properties of the sintered systems using large-scale
              molecular dynamics simulations.  Research will focus on 1) ceramic/ceramic
              interfaces involving, Si3N4, SiC, and Al2O3 with amorphous SiO2 interlayers;
              and 2) sintering in laminated multilayer films consisting of nanoparticles of
              these ceramics with glassy coating.  The objectives are to investigate: 
              structure, stresses, friction, and debonding at interfaces;  effects of
              thermal-expansion mismatch/anisotropy, nanoparticle size, and interfacial
              glassy layers on sintering; residual stress distribution; and delamination. 
              Algorithms will be designed to carry out multiscale simulations combining the
              coarse-grained MD and the finite element methods in a metacomputing environment
              with multiple parallel machines, mass storage devices, and immersive and
              interactive virtual environments on a Grid with high speed networks.

The
              proposed research will have significant impact on new multilayer ceramic
              integrated circuit technologies in the electronic industry.
