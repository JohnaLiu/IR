Abstract    :
              0086213
The workshop will permit that the researchers, who have received grants
              from NSF 98-42 to study the long-term durability of materials and structures,
              share information on their recent accomplishments. This will bring a unique
              opportunity to scientists and engineers conducting research in the field of
              durability to be exposed to new methods and materials used in diverse
              applications. Another goal of the workshop is to provide close links between
              basic research and engineering applications in the field of deterioration
              science by also inviting engineers from a number of agencies. The workshop will
              present open discussions on innovative accelerated tests and modeling of
              deterioration behavior as well as research needs which will enable reliable
              prediction of long-term performance from short-term tests.***
