The National Science Foundation's proposed National
              Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) will establish 10 observatories located
              throughout the United States that will serve as national research platforms for
              integrated studies in field biology. This proposal specifically addresses the
              logistics and arrangements for a NEON management planning workshop that will be
              2-4 May 2000 at the Santa Fe Institute. Participants will review how the NEON
              observatories will provide a state-of-the-art infrastructure to support
              interdisciplinary, integrated research and allow scientist to conduct
              comprehensive, continental-scale experiments on ecological systems. Specific
              components of management of individual observatories, network-level management
              needs, and interactions between the network and NSF will be discussed. In
              addition, the group will discuss evaluation of the NEON by NSF and external
              sources. This proposal outlines the details of the workshop program, travel
              arrangements for participants, food services, and lodging. A workshop report
              will be posted on the NEON website (http://www.sdsc.edu/NEON) maintained by the
              San Diego Supercomputer Center within two months of the workshop.
