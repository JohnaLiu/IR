Abstract    :
              We propose a collaboration between Harvard and the Cambridge Public Schools to
              help public school students learn science and technology. Cambridge teachers
              follow a curriculum which meets standards of the Massachusetts Comprehensive
              Assessment System (MCAS) and prepares students for state-wide examinations. Our
              plan is based on teams, each consisting of one faculty member, three GK-12
              Fellows, and three Cambridge teachers. Each team will choose a topic from one
              of three areas: the environment, materials science, and information technology.
              During the first half year the team will meet weekly to introduce Cambridge
              teachers to research at Harvard and to discuss how to involve students in
              investigations related to the Cambridge curriculum and MCAS standards. In the
              second half year, GK- 12 Fellows will move to the Cambridge Public Schools to
              help teachers and students in discussions and student projects. A workshop will
              be held at the end of the year in which Cambridge students present their
              results to an audience of students and parents. We will start with eighth grade
              students and move to the ninth and tenth grades in following years. These
              activities will help Cambridge students learn science and technology and help
              GK- 12 Fellows become more involved in public education.
