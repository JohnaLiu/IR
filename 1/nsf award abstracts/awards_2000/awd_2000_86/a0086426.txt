Abstract    :
              The goal of the Clemson University GK-12 Project is to improve student
              performance and the teaching of mathematics and science in the middle grades in
              Title I and "impaired" schools in the school districts of Anderson and Pickens
              county through the use of inquiry based learning exemplifying a standards-based
              approach. Benefits are to improve the perception of K-12 mathematics and
              science education among professional graduate scientists and mathematicians in
              academe and industry, to increase knowledgeable participation and support by
              scientists and mathematicians of K-12 education; to improve the perception of
              collegiate education and the professorate among professional K-12 teachers and
              administrators, and to improve the teaching skills of graduate students in
              mathematics and science disciplines through practice and training in the
              inquiry method with practice in the K-12 arena. Benefits to the teachers
              include a stipend, content resource support, graduate credit, improved
              laboratory equipment and manipulatives, and role models for their students. The
              University will benefit through closer ties with the local schools. The Fellows
              will have improved presentation skills through mentoring from the teachers. 
              Graduate students in Biological Sciences, Computer Science, Geological
              Sciences, Mathematical Sciences, and Physics will undergo in-depth training in
              teaching methods, familiarization with South Carolina frameworks and
              performance standards, a series of seminars with their mentoring teacher to
              develop demonstration lessons and ways in which the Fellows will provide
              content resources for NSF sponsored exemplary curricula, several of which have
              been developed at Clemson University. Fellows will team with mentoring teachers
              to provide professional development to colleagues in their schools.
