Abstract    :
              We will discuss when two dynamical systems can be considered equivalent under a
              smooth change of variables. 

This is a natural problem since results on
              dynamics should be invariant under changes of variables.  The problem is also
              related to singularity theory (classifying functions up to smooth changes of
              variables of the domain and the range), the topological classification of
              dynamical systems, and the rigidity program of classification of group
              actions.

We will discuss the following situations, when a reasonable
              classification can be accomplished:
a) Local equivalence near a  hyperbolic
              fixed point 
b) Hyperbolic systems 
c) KAM theory 
d) Nilpotent groups 
e)
              Renormalization.

The lectures will be pedagogical and will attempt to
              introduce people to this area of research.
