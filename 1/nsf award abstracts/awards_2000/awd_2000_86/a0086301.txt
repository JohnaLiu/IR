This award provides partial support for a special track in
              Neural Engineering as part of the annual Biomedical Engineering Society meeting
              in Seattle, Washington in October 2000.  The meeting will 1) bring together
              scientists and engineers working in the area of Neural Engineering, 2) provide
              a opportunity for young scientists to organize and chair multidisciplinary
              sessions 3) provide mini-symposia in chosen topics of Neural Engineering 4)
              provide a forum for scientists, engineers and students to present their
              research in Neural Engineering through oral presentations and poster
              presentations.  The Neural Engineering track is part of a larger scientific and
              engineering meeting whereby interaction and collaboration between
              neuro-scientists and biomedical engineers will be greatly enhanced.

The
              Annals of Biomedical Engineering is to publish a special issue dedicated to
              this Neural Engineering Track.
