Abstract    :
              The International Antarctic Benthic Deep-Sea Biodiversity Program begins planned
              field work on the German Icebreaker, R/V Polarstern during the 2001-2002
              austral season.  The proposed research for this program addresses the following
              themes: 1) the origins of the deep-sea benthic fauna in relation to the
              Antarctic shelf and linkages to the deep-sea faunas of the Atlantic and Pacific
              Oceans; 2) development of hypotheses to explain high biodiversity in the deep
              sea; 3) deep-sea benthic community structure in the Southern Ocean; and 4)
              biological process including reproduction and larval development of benthic
              invertebrates.  Within this scheme, the proposed work will focus on seven
              polychaete families.  During the course of two cruises, materials will be
              collected to map the spatial and bathymetric distributions of polychaete
              families while incorporating GIS mapping software.  The systematics of the
              selected polychaete families will be examined.  Furthermore, larval and
              post-larval stages will be observed in an effort to understand the mode of
              larval dispersal for Antarctic and deep-sea polychaetes.  This information will
              contribute to an understanding of the origins and evolution of these families
              in the Southern Ocean.
