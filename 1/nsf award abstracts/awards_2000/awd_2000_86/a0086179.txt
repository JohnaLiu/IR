Abstract    :
              The Ozarks RSI proposes to use an existing coalition of school districts in
              rural
southwestern Missouri to initiate systemic reform of science,
              mathematics, engineering
and technology. The target school districts evidence
              a desire for reform and the districts' 
26,090 students meet the criteria
              established by NSF.

During the development year, the Southwest Center for
              Educational Excellence
will take a strong leadership role in the collection of
              data and the delivery of services.
The SCEE has strong performance capacity
              and has been active in professional
development and curriculum training since
              its formation. The leadership team is headed
by Dr. Arch Gordanier,
              Superintendent at Seneca R-1. Dr. Gordanier and the project
director has
              experience with the El Paso USI and with TIMSS research. They expect to
expand
              their coalition of local teachers, business leaders, community members,
              students
and university officials throughout the development year.

The
              Ozarks RSI's primary goal is to ensure that in international comparisons
              all
of our students achieve exemplary levels of mathematical and scientific
              understanding
through creating partnerships and networks; applying research;
              and designing, sharing,
implementing and disseminating exemplary programs and
              practices.
