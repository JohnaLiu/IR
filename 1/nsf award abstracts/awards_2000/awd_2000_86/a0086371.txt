This US-Mexico award will fund an international
              workshop on nitrogen regulation in ascomycetes, to be held at Cuernavaca,
              Mexico from March 21 to March 25, 2001.   Organizers are Dr. Boris Magasanik,
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Dr. Alicia Gonzalez, Universidad
              Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM).

The proposed workshop will serve to bring
              together major researchers in the area of nitrogen regulation to explore new
              directions influenced by genomics-based approaches, which provide insight into
              the control of nitrogen regulation in metabolic processes and how genes are
              regulated in response to nitrogen availability. An elucidation of the
              similarity and differences of these regulatory interactions in different, but
              related organisms, such as fungi and bacteria is of much theoretical and
              practical interest to most microbiologists.
