              Fellows. Each Graduate Fellow will:

Complete an M.S. in Interdisciplinary
              Studies of an M.S. program in physics, mathematical sciences or chemistry. The
              Interdisciplinary Science program included graduate course work in at least two
              disciplines, two interdisciplinary science courses and a final
              thesis.

Receive training for in-school activities through the mathematics
              and Science Center of the Richmond area schools

Provide enriched science and
              mathematics disciplinary content for current middle-school teachers working
              with them in a training institute and offering in their classrooms model
              lessons for students.

After serving as Fellows, they may become members of
              the Clinical Faculty at Virginia Commonwealth University or the University of
              Virginia, continuing to link the schools and the college teacher preparation
