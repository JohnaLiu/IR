Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT


Macroporous cellulose membranes are being prepared from filter
              paper by cross-linking.  With these highly porous membranes, further chemical
              modifications are carried out in order to obtain affinity membranes containing
              selective ligands for specific protein or enzyme adsorption.  The final goal is
              to produce affinity cartridges which can be used to separate with high
              selectivity a number of proteins. 

As therapeutic proteins find wider use in
              medicine, efficient and effective methods are required to produce these
              proteins economically.  Macroporous affinity membranes offer advantages over
              conventional chromatography by providing higher rates at lower pressure drops. 
              The cross-linked cellulose membranes are mechanically durable and chemically
              stable as well as biocompatible.  They can be used in cartridges for selective
              protein separation and purification and tailored by introduction of specific
              ligands.
