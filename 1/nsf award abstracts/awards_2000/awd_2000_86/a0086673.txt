Abstract    :
              We request SGER funding to develop a novel technology for self-assembling
              spatially ordered arrays of uniformly sized nanostructures (quantum dots) on
              arbitrary substrates.  These arrays have intriguing optical, electronic,
              magnetic and superconducting properties.  We have already demonstrated that
              they exhibit an enhanced transition temperature for the onset of
              superconductivity because of a discretization of the density of quasi-particle
              states. We foresee many other applications of these arrays.

Self-ordering of
              the arrays is achieved through a process known as Coulomb crystallization. This
              technique has many advantages over existing self-assembly methods such as
              Stranski-Krasatanow growth of quantum dots and electrochemical synthesis. We
              will develop the Coulomb crystal technology into a new paradigm for
              nanosynthesis and demonstrate device phenomena in finished nanostructures. A
              theoretical understanding of the self-assembly process will be gained through
              extensive modeling and simulation.
