A special international
              conference, "Foundation of Statistical Inference: Applications in the Medical
              and Social Sciences and in Industry and the Interface with Computer Science",
              will be held in Israel at the conference center at Kiryat Anavim near
              Jerusalem, on December 17-21, 2000.  This conference brings together leading
              experts in statistics and its applications to discuss both the issues in the
              foundations of inference and their relevance to the many and varied uses of
              statistics in the medical sciences, the social sciences, and in industry.  A
              similar conference was held in December 1985.  A special focus at this
              conference will be on the interface between statistics and computer science. 
              Funding will provide travel support for approximately 20 U.S. primarily new
              researchers and members of underrepresented groups, and invited speakers and
              participants.  The KCS Program in the CISE directorate and the MMS Program in
              SBE directorate is providing co-funding along with the Statistics Program in
              MPS.
