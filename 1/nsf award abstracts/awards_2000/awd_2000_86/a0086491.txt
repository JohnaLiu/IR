Thermally reversible covalently (TRC) linked halide containing
              crosslinked polymers based on ionene formation may be particularly suitable for
              manufacturing recyclable materials and for improving the mechanical and
              physical properties of traditional thermoplastic materials without loss of
              thermoplasticity.  These crosslinked polymers can also be employed as thermal
              sensor materials.

Two kinds of thermally reversible reactions, namely the
              thermally reversible Diels-Alder cycloaddition of a diene and the thermally
              reversible Menschutkin reaction, will be employed to generate TRC links.  Salts
              of dicyclopentadiene dicarboxylic acid (SDCPDCA) will be used as TRC
              crosslinkers of halide-containing polymers.  CL-containing polymers possessing
              benzyl chlorine, primary Cl, secondary Cl, tertialy Cl or allyl Cl moieties,
              will be subjected to esterification crosslinking with SDCPDCA.  The latter
              compounds are prepared by reacting dicyclopentadience dicarboxylic acid
              (DCPDCA) with ethoxide or hydroxide.  The crosslinked polymers will exhibit TRC
              crosslinking due to the thermally reversible dedimerization/dimerization of
              -DCPD- bridges.  The above CL-containing polymers will also be crosslinked with
              ditertiary amines vial the formation of ionene networks based on the
              Menschutkin reaction.  The generated ionene networks are expected to exhibit
              TRC crosslinking due to the dequarternization on heating and requarternization
              on cooling of the ionene bridges.
