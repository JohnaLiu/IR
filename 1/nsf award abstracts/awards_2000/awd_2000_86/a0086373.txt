Abstract    :
              The Women in Science Program (WISP) at Indiana University-Bloomington (IUB), is
              creating a research fellowship program to encourage women to pursue science
              degrees and science careers.  The Undergraduate Research Fellowship (URF)
              Program for Women in the Science will provide research experience to
              upper-division undergraduate women who have shown potential and interest in the
              sciences.  Third-year women science majors will participate in researh under
              the auspices of IUB faculty starting the summer of 2001 and continuing for the
              2001-2002 academic year.  The participate will also serve as mentors to
              lower-division undergraduate women interested in pursuing science majors

The
              URF Program will identify qualified students during the 2000-2001 school year
              to begin laboratory work in the summer of 2001.  The Program will run through
              the summer and through both fall and spring semesters of the 2001-2002 academic
              year.  By focusing on upper-division students, the Program hopes to assist
              students to gain the experience they need to pursue careers in laboratory
              research or to be competitive for graduate school.  Students will also be
              required to write a paper and present posters on their research to increase
              their communication, writing and presentation skills, to make them more
              competitive with others in their field.  The laboratory experience provided by
              the URF Program will enhance the participants' research capabilities and will
              increase interest in and preparation for jobs and graduate school majors in the
              sciences.

The interactions among the participants, faculty mentors, fellow
              lad researchers, and the sophomore mentees will increase the support system for
              women in the sciences.  The overarching goal of the URF Program is to increase
              the number of females that graduate with Bachelor's degrees in the sciences and
              to retain them in science fields after graduation.
