Abstract    :
              Baylor College of Medicine (tCM) and the Houston Independent School District
              (HISD), propose to partner BCM graduate student scientists and HISD biology
              teachers to improve teaching and learning in biology, while providing
              opportunities for graduate students to improve their teaching-related skills.
              The project will create guided, goal-oriented partnerships between BCM graduate
              students and 15 selected HISD teachers, provide new professional development
              for all 96 HISD life sciences high school teachers and produce science,
              mathematics, engineering and technology career awareness events for all HISD
              secondary students. A Biosciences Learning Center will be established at an
              HISD school to support project activities as an in-kind contribution. BCM
              graduate student scientists will have opportunities to improve their own
              teaching skills, their knowledge of K-12 education and their abilities to
              communicate science information to novice audiences. Project evaluation will
              investigate changes in graduate students' personal science teaching paradigms
              and beliefs, to development of graduate students' teaching and communications
              skills, to changes in science teachers' content knowledge and to changes in
              student science learning and achievement. Each year, proposed activities will
              impact more than 400 biology students annually through graduate student/teacher
              partnerships, and all 8,000 students enrolled in biology classes through
              teacher professional development.
