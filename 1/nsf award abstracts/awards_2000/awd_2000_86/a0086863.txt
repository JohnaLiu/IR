This project investigates a new technique for in situ
              quantification of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification products using
              electrochemiluminescence (ECL).  The technique implements the highly sensitive,
              ECL detection and quantification of tris(2,2'bipyridyl) ruthenium (II) labeled
              DNA.  This method is expected to yield significant improvement in speed, cost
              and performance over existing quantitative PCR methods, by reducing the number
              and quantity of reagents, reducing the number of sample preparation steps,
              increasing sensitivity, and shortening analysis time.
