The goal of this interdisciplinary research project is to
              develop miniature microscopes that can utilize the interaction of light with
              tissues in many modalities to image morphology and cytochemistry in vivo,
              yielding tools that provide better delineation of tumors.  The investigators
              envision pen-sized, battery-powered multi-modal miniature microscopes (4Ms)
              designed to specifically image microscopic and molecular features of
              pre-cancer.  The proposed miniature microscopes are being called multi-modal
              because of their potential for enabling different imaging modalities such as
              optical sectioning, 3-D spectral fluorescence imaging, and reflectance imaging.
               The size and cost of these microscopes will be small enough so that they can
              be used for wide-scale screening of disease.  These tools will have broad
              applicability in many organ sites due to their very compact size and capability
              for imaging.   The investigators will first apply these tools to improve
              detection of oral-cavity pre-cancers because of the oral cavity's easy
              accessibility.  Furthermore, the assembled multidisciplinary expertise empowers
              the investigators to treat the design of miniaturized imaging sensors in an
              all-inclusive manner.  In addition to developing 4M devices, the investigators
              will also design contrast agents specific for molecular alterations associated
              with pre-cancer that can be applied topically to significantly expand the
              imaging capability of miniature microscopes.
