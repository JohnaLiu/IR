The aim of this project is to support a
              spectroscopic study of stars and dwarf galaxies in the halo of M31. These data
              would extend our detailed knowledge of stellar metallicities and kinematics in
              a systematic way beyond the stars in our own galaxy and its dwarf companions
              and provide valuable information for defining the basic parameters of the Local
              Group and for constraining theoretical pictures of galaxy formation and
              dynamics.

M31 is both the dominant mass concentration in the Local Group and
              nearest large spiral galaxy. Thus, it offers a unique opportunity to study the
              fossil record of galaxy formation in a level of detail which will never be
              possible with high-redshift galaxies.  This work will carry out  a systematic
              study of the dynamics and chemical evolution of M31's stellar halo and its
              dwarf spheroidal galaxies based on spectroscopy of individual red giant branch
              stars measured with the Keck 10m telescopes. Specific goals of the program
              include: (1) a direct measurement of the angular momentum of the M31 stellar
              halo using radial velocities for several hundred halo field stars; (2) a
              measurement of the mass of M31's dark halo on scales of several hundred
              kiloparsecs based on the radial velocities of its outlying satellites; (3) a
              spectroscopic study of the chemical abundances of stars belonging to these
              satellites; and (4) a dynamical survey of the dark matter content in these
              faint galaxies. Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for
              Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).
