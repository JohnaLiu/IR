ITR: Self-Assembly of DNA
              Nano-Scale Structures for Computation

This project is a multi-institutional
              effort to investigate the use of DNA self-assembly to do massively parallel
              computations at the molecular scale. The main goal is to develop a
              proof-of-concept demonstration of the application of DNA self-assembly to
              various basic computational tasks, such as sequences of arithmetic and logical
              computations executed in massively parallel fashion, and the application of
              this method to computational problems such as integer factorization.  The
              research involves testing of various input/output methods, development of novel
              DNA tiles with properties that facilitate the self-assembly and their
              visualization by imaging devices such as an atomic force microscope, and
              methods to minimize errors in self-assembly.  Specifically, the experiments are
              being conducted to evaluate the speed and error rates of the various types of
              self-assembly reactions.  In addition, experimental testing of massively
              parallel DNA self-assembly on particular problems, such as arithmetic and
              Boolean vector operations, is being performed.  Some of the technological areas
              that could be impacted are the application of DNA Lattices as a substrate for
              surface chemistry and as a substrate for layout of nano-scale circuit
              components, the construction of 3D DNA lattices, and DNA motors and their
              application to DNA computations.
