Abstract    :
              This workshop will bring together US and foreign researchers to develop and
              enhance methodology to expand the role of the IUCN Red List of Threatened 
              Species as tool for monitoring trends in biodiversity.  The International Union
              of Conservation of Nature's Red List is widely recognized as the most
              comprehensive, apolitical global system to evaluate the conservation status of
              plant and animal species.  To enable the Red List to function as an indicator
              of the state of biodiversity, the state of species, and the state of
              ecosystems, two major changes are required.  The first is much better
              documentation of each species entry in the list, in particular, whether its
              population is increasing, decreasing, or stable.  The second change is
              agreement on the core taxonomic coverage of the Red List.  This needs to
              include groups that are broadly representative of the major ecosystems of the
              world, that are taxonomically tractable, that are reasonably well-known, and
              for which expertise networks exist or could be developed.  The outcome of this
              workshop will be to develop indices from Red List criteria that will provide a
              valuable tool for biodiversity planners and to serve as the basis for strategic
              development of the Red-list program.
