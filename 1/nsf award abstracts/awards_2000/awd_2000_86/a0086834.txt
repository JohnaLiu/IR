Abstract    :
              This New Technologies for the Environment project will demonstrate the
              proof-of-concept for vapor deposition of photoimageable dielectric polymer
              films through an integrated experimental investigation that will provide
              fundamental understanding of thin film processing, properties and performance
              capabilities and limitations. If successful, this research will lay the
              foundation for realization of significant environmental advantages in printed
              circuit board manufacture and in advanced microelectronics packaging.  The
              inherent photosensitivity of the polymer films will allow the elimination of a
              significant number of waste-generating process steps from the overall
              manufacturing process flow, and the production of the thin films through vapor
              deposition will eliminate solvent wastes in precursor production, thin film
              application, and shelf-life expiration.

This research will address key
              barrier issues inhibiting the implementation of photoimageable dielectric
              technology. Focus will be on auto-photosensitive film deposition from
              pyromellitic dianhydrides and co-monomers from the ortho-aliphatic
              di-substituted diaminodiphenylmethane series. Life Cycle Analyses will be
              conducted to demonstrate the environmental benefits of the technology including
              minimal emissions, solvent-free film production, and high precursor
              utilization.
