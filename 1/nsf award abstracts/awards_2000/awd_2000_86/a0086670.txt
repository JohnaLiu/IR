Abstract    :
              The National Geotechnical Experimentation Sites (NGES) program comprises a
              system of six well-characterized sites located throughout the United States
              that are available for full-scale geotechnical experiments.  In 1998, the
              National Council for Geo-Engineering and Construction (the Geo Council), a
              council of ten geo-related organizations, assumed management of the NGES
              program.  The Geo Council expressed interest in expanding the program to new
              types of sites, such as a geoenvironmental site or a rock site.  In addition,
              with FHWA support, the NGES database is currently being updated and improved
              and will be a major asset for users including professionals, educators,
              researchers and students.  In order to give direction and priorities to NGES
              program, a workshop is planned, with NSF support, to develop a broader vision
              for the program and inject some new thoughts and people into the process.  The
              workshop, to be held in the fall, 2000, will be sponsored by the Geo Council
              and will produce a report that is widely disseminated and available on the
              council's Web site: www.geocouncil.org
