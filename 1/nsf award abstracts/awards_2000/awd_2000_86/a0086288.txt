"NStars: Understanding the L-dwarfs and
              T-dwarfs"


Dr. Marley is working to produce a model spectral catalog for
              L-dwarf and T-dwarf stars.  Also known as 'brown dwarf stars,' most of these
              objects are below the hydrogen-burning limit for normal stars.  To facilitate
              the discovery of and subsequent follow-up research on brown dwarfs Dr. Marley
              and colleagues are computing a library of theoretical high-resolution spectra
              covering the wavelength regime of 0.5-1000 micrometers appropriate for objects
              with effective temperatures ranging from 500-2200 K and metallicities ranging
              from -2 < [Fe/H] < 0.5.  The models include the opacity of alkali metals and
              the influence of dusty condensates.  The resulting model spectra are compared
              to the observed spectra of L- and T-dwarfs over the full temperature and age
              ranges of L- and T-dwarfs.  The results are distributed to the scientific
              community via the web.
Funding for this project was provided by the NSF
              Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics  (AST/SAA) program through the joint NSF/NASA
              "Nearby Stars (NStars)" initiative, and the NSF Mathematical & Physical
              Sciences Directorate Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (MPS/OMA).
