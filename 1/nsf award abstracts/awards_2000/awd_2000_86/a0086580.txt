The project supports the completion of translations of
              Korean mathematics texts and accompanying teacher's manuals for Grades 1-6. 
              The Korean instruction on number and computation is being analyzed to reveal
              how key concepts are developed.  A similar analysis is being conducted for both
              traditional and reform materials in use in the U.S., and a comparison of the
              instructional strategies across all texts will be made.  An interpretive report
              is being prepared so that a variety of audiences (e.g., teachers, curriculum
              developers, teacher educators) can make quality judgements about the different
              instructional approaches.
