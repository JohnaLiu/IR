This is a collaborative research project with
              William F. Welsh at San Diego State University (AST0086692). This project will
              use the 9m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) to obtain high signal-to-noise spectra
              of QSO broad line regions, with good time sampling, to analyze changes in the
              full kinematic spectral profiles as a function of time. These will be used to
              test different kinematic QSO models ( inflow vs. outflow) for the broad line
              emission regions.

Lurking at the center of many massive galaxies are
              supermassive Black Holes (BH). If there is material nearby, the BH will trap
              and accrete this matter releasing a huge amount of energy which will show up as
              increased luminosity of the galaxy nucleus. Galaxies which possess such an
              accreting BH are said to have an "active Nucleus" (AGN). Accretion is an
              inherently unstable process. The accretion region close to the BH is called the
              Broad Line Region (BLR). The BLR is luminous because it is photoionized by the
              hard (UV and x-ray) continuum flux produced very close to the BH. Because this
              ionizing radiation is variable, so is the BLR. Thus the emission lines from the
              BLR "echo" the variations in the continuum flux. Using these "echoes"
              structures near the BH with microarcsecond scales can be mapped. To do this one
              needs a very long time baseline of well-sampled observations of the variations
              in the BLR. This requires data over weeks or months. The "HET Echo Mapping
              Project" is a new research project which aims to: (1) Map the size, geometry,
              and flow of the BLR gas. (2) Make direct estimates of the mass of the central
              BH using the geometry and kinematics of the BLR. (3) map AGN with BH of 10 to
              100 times the mass of those previously measured. (4) Measure the parameters of
              any accretion wind and the temporal changes in the BLR. Funding for this
              project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology
              (AST/EXC).
