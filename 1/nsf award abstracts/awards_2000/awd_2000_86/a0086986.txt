              Abstract
   The  New Mexico Analysis Seminar is
   an  annual three-day
              meeting, now in its fourth year.
   Its principal goal is to provide an
              opportunity for scientific exchange
   among mathematics students and faculty
              in the Southwest
   region and beyond. To encourage participation, analysis is
              defined broadly. 
   The centerpiece of the seminar is a series of one hour
              lectures
   given by a first rate mathematician who is also a first rate
              lecturer, 
   capable of communicating very well with students and faculty.
              Time is 
   allocated for shorter talks and informal discussion as well. 
  
              The main speaker for
   the Fourth New Mexico Analysis Seminar  will be Steve
              Hofmann, who
   recently proved Kato's 40 year old conjecture known as
   the
              Square Root Problem.

   The New Mexico Analysis
   Seminar is playing an
              important role in facilitating student exposure to
   pioneering research and
              in providing role models for future and present
   practitioners and
              communicators of mathematics in the classroom and in
   industry. The need for
              this is particularly urgent in a region of relative  
   geographical
              isolation and limited financial resources. The conference
   site alternates
              between New Mexico State University and The University
   of New Mexico, which
              have the only Ph.D. granting mathematics programs
   in New
              Mexico.
