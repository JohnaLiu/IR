This award supports a collaborative research and education
              project on the scholarship of diffraction education and utilization of advanced
              diffraction methods in chemical research.  Dr. Allen D. Hunter of Youngstown
              State University will spend a first-time sabbatical working with Dr. J. Derek
              Woollins and Alexander Slawin of St. Andrews University in Scotland.  The
              objectives of this collaboration are: (1) to conduct research on structures and
              bonding of main group inorganic and organometallic ring and cage complexes in
              solid state and determine their spectroscopic properties in solution; and (2)
              prepare a variety of teaching materials in crystallography.  The US
              investigator is a crystallographer and brings to this collaboration expertise
              in diffraction methods .  This is complemented by the Scottish group's
              expertise in main group inorganic and organometallic chemistry, their excellent
              crystallography facilities, and different approach to teaching diffraction
              methods.   The project will advance understanding of the synthesis and
              characterization of novel main group organometallic and coordination complexes,
              and result in new teaching materials on diffraction methods.
