Abstract    :
              Experimentation and exploration - the way scientists create new knowledge - will
              be adopted as the cornerstone for learning and teaching science in Arizona
              State University's Down to Earth Science fellow/teacher/student partnership
              program. The activities are based on a strongly interdisciplinary, multiscalar
              approach to earth systems science in three important research domains that
              powerfully convey science content - Materials Science and Engineering, Ecology,
              and Planetary Studies.

ASU is poised to launch, and sustain, new approaches
              to increasing scientific literacy. We will expand upon the strong
              infrastructure of successful K-12 educational outreach programs from
              large-scale science and engineering research projects as well as ongoing and
              extensive collaborations with K-12 education.
This project will: 1) integrate
              research, education, and outreach in a meaningful way by incorporating
              instructional strategies consistent with the national science standards; 2)
              increase teachers'knowledge of science content and concepts, and provide them
              opportunities to engage their students in actual scientific research; 3) help
              revitalize science education from the use of abstract and obscure examples to
              the contextual and the relevant; and (4) instill fellows with the skills to
              communicate scientific concepts to a wider audience and prepare them to be
              mentors and role models for students.
