Abstract    :
              Project Summary- We describe an educational partnership between The University
              of Akron, the Cuyahoga Valley Environmental Education Center, Bath Township
              Elementary School, and Akron Public School District that builds an educational
              community covering K-graduate work in Life Sciences. Each partner will provide
              expertise in training GK- 12 fellows in research, teacher training, and
              curriculum and pedagogy development. Impact of our project will stretch well
              beyond a single school district, to train teachers that come into contact
              annually with more than 15,000 K- 12 students in over 20 school districts in NE
              Ohio. A compelling feature of our project is the integration of GK- 12 graduate
              research projects into content modules that will serve as the organizing theme
              for teacher professional development and curricular enhancement. Our model
              moves well beyond the central goal of using GK- 1 2 Fellows as K- 12 content
              resources. Our approach allows faculty and GK- 12 fellows to integrate their
              research and teaching goals (an NSF priority) and to provide curricular content
              that is immediately and directly relevant to the K- 12 institutions. Because
              each of these partners already cooperate in educational activities, building
              the comprehensive partnership we describe will benefit from well established
              lines of communication. Furthermore, extending the existing solid foundation
              promises that the educational community we seek will have longevity well beyond
              the granting cycle.
