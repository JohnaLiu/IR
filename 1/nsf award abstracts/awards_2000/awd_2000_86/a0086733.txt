Abstract    :
              This goal of this research project is to develop a new geocomposite overlay to
              contain and remediate contaminated, subaqueous sediments.  The existing state
              of practice to treat such sediments is either subaqueous capping with clean
              sediments, or removal of the sediment for ex situ treatment and/or storage. 
              The geosynthetic-based, reactive cap to be developed will provide the same
              isolation as that of traditional caps, but will also: provide a remediation
              layer that will absorb and effectively neutralize target contaminants; block
              resuspension of fine dediment particles; and serve as a stable, protective
              foundation material.  After prototype geocomposite designs have been developed,
              a bench-scale testing series will use an existing large-scale consolidation
              device to assess each geocomposite's filtering interactions and remediation
              effectiveness.  Tests using three soils of different grain sizes and two
              contaminants will indicate the amount of remediation, contaminant/particle
              resuspension, and limitations of the geocomposite with regard to long-term
              performance.  The geocomposite's remediation process will be analytically
              modeled using the test results and existing data on subaqueous sediments.  The
              research will show the feasibility of this concept at the bench scale, and
              serve as a basis for field scale implementation and modeling.
