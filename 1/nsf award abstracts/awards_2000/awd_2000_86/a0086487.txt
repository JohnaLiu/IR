              ABSTRACT

Lodders, Katharina
"NStars: Understanding the L-dwarfs and
              T-dwarfs"
AST-0086487

Dr. Lodders is working to produce a model spectral
              catalog for L-dwarf and T-dwarf stars.  Also known as 'brown dwarf stars,' most
              of these objects are below the hydrogen-burning limit for normal stars.  To
              facilitate the discovery of and subsequent follow-up research on brown dwarfs
              Dr. Lodders and colleagues are computing a library of theoretical
              high-resolution spectra covering the wavelength regime of 0.5-1000 micrometers
              appropriate for objects with effective temperatures ranging from 500-2200 K and
              metallicities ranging from -2 < [Fe/H] < 0.5.  The models include the opacity
              of alkali metals and the influence of dusty condensates.  The resulting model
              spectra are compared to the observed spectra of L- and T-dwarfs over the full
              temperature and age ranges of L- and T-dwarfs.  The results are distributed to
              the scientific community via the web.
Funding for this project was provided by
              the NSF Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics  (AST/SAA) program through the joint
              NSF/NASA "Nearby Stars (NStars)" initiative, and the NSF Mathematical &
              Physical Sciences Directorate Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
              (MPS/OMA).
