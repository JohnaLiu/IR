Abstract    :
              Interdisciplinary (99) The interdisciplinary field at the interface of physical
              and life sciences is undergoing explosive growth. More and more Physics
              departments are hiring faculty in this field, yet those faculty complain of the
              lack of a suitable textbook to teach their subject at the undergraduate level.
              Indeed the core foundational material for this subject can be taught
              successfully at the sophomore level. The same course can also introduce much
              foundational material for later study in nanotechnology. The objective of this
              project is to create a text Biological Physics and a suite of ancillary
              materials, including Web materials, to address these needs, which will be of
              interest and useful to undergraduates in Physics, Biology, Biophysics,
              Biochemistry, Materials Science, Chemical and Bio-Engineering, all the way up
              to advanced graduate students. The text will be class-tested by faculty
              interested in teaching this material at a variety of institutions, and it will
              be published by a major textbook firm.
