Abstract    :
              This Americas Program award will support a US-Brazil research project between
              Drs. George B. McManus and Hans G. Dam, University of Connecticut, and Dr.
              Rubens M. Lopes at the State University of Santa Cruz in Brazil.  The goal of
              the project is to investigate the trophic role of zooplankton on the Brazilian
              continental shelf, and in particular the effect of ecosystem forcing on
              biological structure and trophic relationships within the plankton.

In this
              project the physical mechanisms that control the seasonal intrusion of the
              South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) onto the continental shelf of the Southern
              Brazilian Bight will be studied, and its impact on the biological processes of
              the region's ecosystem will be evaluated.  It is hypothesized that intrusions
              of the nutrient-rich SACW onto the shelf are partly responsible for the high
              fisheries yield as well as for some of the year-to-year fluctuations in fish
              stocks.  The linkages between nutrient-input events and fish production are
              made though micro- and metazoan zooplankton.  This research will fill a gap in
              the knowledge of the structure and function of these zooplankton and of the
              interactions between them.  It will combine the strengths of the Brazilian
              researchers in taxonomy and descriptive ecology with those of U.S. scientists
              in experimental process studies.
