              ABSTRACT

King, Jeremy
"NStars: Spectroscopic Abundances in Nearby Solar-Type
              Stars"
AST-0086576

Dr. King is measuring photospheric chemical abundances
              for 5000 solar-type stars within 60 parsecs of the Sun using low-resolution
              spectroscopy.  Additional high resolution spectroscopy is performed for a
              subset of these stars to examine the frequency of chromospheric activity,
              multiplicity, kinematics, rotation rates, ages, and metallicities with which to
              address issues concerning planetary companions, circumstellar environment, and
              the Galactic chemical evolution history.  The project also seeks to address how
              these parameters vary among stars in nearby open clusters.  The necessary
              observations are performed at NSF-supported Cerro Tololo Inter-American
              Observatory, and the Lick, Keck and McDonald Observatories.  The large quantity
              of information on stars in the solar neighborhood that is collected in the
              course of this project is incorporated into the NStars database, where it is
              widely available to the astronomical community.
Funding for this project was
              provided by the NSF Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics  (AST/SAA) program through
              the joint NSF/NASA "Nearby Stars (NStars)" initiative, and the NSF Mathematical
              & Physical Sciences Directorate Office of Multidisciplinary Activities
              (MPS/OMA).
