Abstract    :
              This research addresses the problem of adding data management facilities to
              inherently autonomous, distributed information sources such as those that occur
              in the web. Here, by data management, is meant the allocation and structuring
              of resources to provide more responsive access to data for applications. In
              this kind of environment, data management must be superimposed through an
              independently controlled service that exists between the data sources and the
              applications. This is facilitated through the introduction of architecture
              based on data centers, a collection of machines that prestage and distribute
              data for its clients. Client applications submit profiles describing their
              overall data needs, and the data center gathers data and organizes it on behalf
              of their clients in order to provide efficient data access. This research
              explores systems issues and techniques for the design and operation of data
              centers. This includes the management of large numbers of profiles, heuristics
              for balancing the needs of large numbers of users against the available
              resources of the data center, and the efficient processing of future client
              data needs against the data that is managed by the data center.
