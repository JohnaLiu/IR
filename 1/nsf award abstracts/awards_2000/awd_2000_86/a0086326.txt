This US-Mexico award will help to fund participation by
              senior and junior researchers and students in the 2nd Iberoamerican Congress on
              Geometry, to be held in Guanajuato, Mexico, January 2001 on the general topic
              of Riemann surfaces. Organized by Prof. Irwin Kra of SUNY at Stony Brook and
              Prof. Xavier Gomez-Mont of the Centro de Investigacion en Matematicas (CIMAT)
              in Guanajuato, the meeting will continue and expand the activities initiated at
              the 1st Iberoamerican Congress held in Chile in 1998, promoting international
              collaboration by bringing together researchers from Latin America, Europe and
              the U.S.   

The main themes for the discussions will be automorphic forms,
              theta functions and Poincare theta series; discrete groups and Teichmuller
              theory; maps on surfaces, Galois groups, and Klein surfaces; complex dynamics
              and ordinary differential equations.  Emphasis will be on recent results and
              new methods through workshop sessions in the various themes of the meeting. 
              Expository talks on important topics will be presented and conference results
              will be published in a proceedings volume available to the mathematics
              community.
