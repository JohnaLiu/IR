              Educational Innovation: Integrating Agent Technology into CISE Curriculum Using
              Lecturelets

This project integrates research results from agent technology
              into both course delivery mechanisms and course content in computing curricula.
              Specific "smart" learning materials for individual subjects, including
              definition/description, examples, exercises, quizzes, projects, and
              supplemental information are developed and implemented into lecturelets (active
              XML documents with Java code) for customized interactive presentation of
              subjects. The lecturelets are self-contained and can be integrated into a wide
              range of courses.  They contain both the XML documents and the instructions
              (templates/agents) on how documents should be processed or displayed according
              to the profile and model of a student. In addition to developing the
              lecturelets delivery system, the project also provides course materials (i.e. a
              collection of lecturlets) on agent technology that can be used as a stand-alone
              course or integrated into existing courses in such fields as software
              engineering, distributed systems, communication systems, and AI-related
              courses.
