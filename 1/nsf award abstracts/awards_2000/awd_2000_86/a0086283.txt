Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Society Symposium on Anisotropic Nanoparticles -
              Synthesis, Characterization, and Applications will be held in Boston, MA
              November 27 - December 1, 2000.  The goal of the conference is to facilitate
              multidisciplinary interactions and information exchange within a broad spectrum
              of researchers and top post doctoral scholars and graduate students working in
              priority areas of the broad field of nanoparticles.  The NSF funds will be used
              to offset expenses associated with attending the symposium for graduate
              students, post doctoral scholars, and junior faculty, many of whom will present
              posters.

The nanoscience and technology community continues to have
              direct impact on important technological areas that are crucial to advancing
              society through the design, synthesis and application new nanoscaled materials
              involved in the assembly of value-added materials and devices from
              nanoassembled anisotropic particles with benefits to the biotechnology and
              computer industries.  Students educated and trained in these multidisciplinary
              areas compete very well in the job market and go on to contribute in many
              significant ways to the global economy.
