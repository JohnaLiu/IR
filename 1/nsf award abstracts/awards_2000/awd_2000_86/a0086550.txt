Abstract    :
                  This project involves the measurement of aerosol optical properties in east
              Asian outflow.  The measurements will be made during the spring of 2001 aboard
              the NOAA R/V Ron Brown.  Aerosol light scattering properties will be obtained
              with controlled relative humidity nephelometry.  These measurements will
              describe the ambient aerosol light scattering coefficients and their dependence
              on wavelength of visible light, direction of light scattered (total and back),
              and upper particle under increasing and decreasing controlled relative humidity
              conditions.  These measurements will be used in conjunction with other
              shipboard aerosol measurements to relate aerosol scattering to chemical
              composition, refractive index, and dry particle size distributions.
