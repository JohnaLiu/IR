Abstract    :
              Current software design concepts for products, processes, projects, programs,
              portfolios, and policies largely overlook a simple but fundamental idea: the
              goal of software design decision making is to create the maximum value added
              for any given investment of valuable resources. In a business context, profit
              and opportunities to profit are most valued. In other context, other measures
              of value apply, such as the solution of major social problems by philanthropic
              foundations. The investigation will focus on developing and enhancing
              scientific foundations for software design decision-making models, methods and
              tools explicitly tied to value-maximization objectives. Strategic approaches to
              value creation under conditions of uncertainty, incomplete knowledge,
              competition, and the need for cooperation among self-interested stakeholders
              will receive particular attention.  The research is a joint effort of the
              University of Virginia, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of
              Washington, and the University of Southern California.
