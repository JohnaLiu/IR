Abstract    :
              The investigators will study the ionospheric response to short-term variations
              in the solar spectrum; particularly those associated with solar flares.  Solar
              radiation in the soft X-ray and extreme ultraviolet spectral regions is the
              source of the non-auroral ionosphere.  Variations in the solar flux may perturb
              the ionospheric morphology and behavior.  The study use theoretical models and
              incoherent scatter radar measurements to investigate the effects on electron
              density, ion composition, minor species concentrations, and airglow.  The
              investigators will also use Faraday rotation measurements of very high
              frequency signals from geostationary satellites to compare with models of the
              seasonal and latitudinal asymmetries in total electron content during
              ionospheric disturbances.
