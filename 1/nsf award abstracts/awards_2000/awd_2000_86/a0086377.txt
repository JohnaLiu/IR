This grant supports the Cold Spring Harbor Conference on
              Axon Guidance and Neural Plasticity.  The field of axon guidance and
              developmental plasticity have emerged as one of the most exciting and rapidly
              growing areas in Neuroscience and during the last 5 years exceptional progress
              has been made in guidance molecules and their receptors.  This meeting will
              assemble many of the leaders of the field to discuss leading edge developments
              in the field and the impact of recent advances in genomics.  In addition,
              efforts have been made to include graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and
              junior faculty in the program, in large part via afternoon poster sessions.  It
              is expected that this will be a biennial event and the first meeting in 1998
              was considered to be highly successful.  There is a clear organizational plan
              and detailed list of distinguished speakers.  There has also been a clear
              effort made to recruit applications from underrepresented minorities and women
              have a significant presence on the program, including session chairs.
