Abstract    :
              A six-member project team is developing and administering a survey that
              evaluates the experiences of mechanical engineering programs that have
              undergone ABET Engineering Criteria 2000 review. The survey consists of a
              questionnaire and a set of metrics developed by a focus group representing a
              cross-section of four-year undergraduate mechanical engineering programs
              evaluated under ABET EC2000. Site visits to participating institutions are also
              being conducted. Survey results from ME programs across the nation are being
              collected and analyzed. Findings are being disseminated to all mechanical
              engineering programs and to academic committees of other engineering
              disciplines.
