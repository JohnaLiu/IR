Abstract    :
              0086876  Davis  The objective of this research is to make new biopolymers to
              stabilize aqueous suspensions of inorganic colloidal particles.  Such
              suspensions are used in processes for making microelectronics, structural
              ceramics, filled adhesives, coatings, biomedical devices and personal care
              products.  A problem common to all of these applications lies in controlling
              the state of aggregation of the suspensions.  Particle aggregation leads to
              higher viscosities and sedimentation of the solid particles, effects that are
              very undesirable for suspension processing and application. Additionally, many
              particle processes still employ organic solvents, but environmental concerns
              will soon require that the fluid phase for suspension processing be converted
              from organic solvents to water.  Prior research indicates that copolymers of
              amino acids have the potential to form stabilizing molecules for metal oxide
              nanoparticles.  The structures to be developed are diblock and triblock
              copolymers of amino acids that have an adsorbing anchor block and a
              non-adsorbing tail block.  Two approaches to biosynthesis of these structures
              will be studied: 1) to engineer E. Coli to produce monodisperse diblock and
              triblock copolymers that stabilize alumina nanoparticles and 2) to screen
              combinatorial libraries of polypeptides for anchor block candidates for
              aluminum oxide particles. This grant is made pursuant to Solicitation NSF
