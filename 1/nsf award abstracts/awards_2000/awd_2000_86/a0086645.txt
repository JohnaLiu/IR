This award supports a Small Grant for Exploratory Research
              (SGER) to study  glaciological change in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica
              under the category of  "application of new expertise or new approaches to
              established research topics".  The purpose of the project is to assess the
              application of classified imagery to the study of the magnitude and rate of
              change of glacier extent and lake area as an indicator of climate change. 
              Because the rate of change of both glacier extent and lake area is small
              compared to the resolution of unclassified imagery, the increased resolution of
              classified imagery is clearly needed.  Access to classified imagery with 1
              meter or better resolution will provide a baseline measurement against which
              future changes can be compared.  Maximum use will be made of archived imagery
              but if necessary, one request will be made for new imagery to supplement the
              existing archive.  This work will support on-going field measurements which are
              part of the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in the McMurdo Dry
              Valleys but which are limited by logistic constraints to only a few
              measurements during limited times of the year.  If successful, the information
              gained in this project will enable researchers to better direct their efforts
              to identify the important physical processes controlling the changes in the
              valleys.  The information acquired in conducting this project will be made
              available to the public, using appropriate security procedures to declassify
              the data.  The "exploratory" and "high risk" nature of the proposed work and
              its "potential" to make an important "impact" on the field of Antarctic glacier
              studies are all reasons that this work is appropriate to support as an
              SGER.
