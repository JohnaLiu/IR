Abstract    :
              The long term goal of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project
              is to provide a web-based resource for sharing information about research
              funded through the Plant Genome Research Program.  This resource will serve
              several roles.  First, it will provide an internal resource for rapid
              communication of ideas and issues among members of ongoing projects.  Second,
              it will serve as a resource to members of the community seeking information
              about Plant Genome projects or opportunities for participation.  Third, it will
              serve as site for informing the community about new initiatives and soliciting
              input on a variety of issues.  In summary, this resource will facilitate the
              interaction between members of Plant Genome projects and broaden the
              participation of the community in sharing the resources generated by these
              projects.
