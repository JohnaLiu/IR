Abstract    :
              0086860  Deshusses  The objective of this project is to develop an alternative
              to trickling bed filters and other biofilter configurations that are currently
              employed to remove and destroy volatile organic contaminants in air streams. 
              The conventional technologies are prone to biomass build up which, in turn,
              diminishes performance due to increased pressure drop and channeling.  The
              proposed alternative contacts contaminant-laden air with descending droplets
              that contain microbes.  The droplets are formed by pumping a microbial
              suspension through an array of nozzles.  Microbial-mediated degradation of air
              contaminants occurs as the pollutants transport from the gas to the droplet
              phase.  The liquid collects at the bottom of the device.  It can be recycled to
              continually introduce droplets with biomass into the process and excess biomass
              can be purged.  Apart from good interfacial contacting and potentially rapid
              kinetics, the proposed device offers the benefits of (1) low pressure drop and
              (2) steady vs. intermittent operation.  The panel was intrigued with the idea
              and viewed the proposal as fitting well with the initiative.
