Abstract    :
              Funding is provided to support an AGU Chapman Conference on the North Atlantic
              Oscillation (NAO). The goal of the conference is to move toward a consensus on
              the primary process or processes which are responsible for observe low
              frequency variations in the NAO, including its unprecedented upward trend over
              the past 30 years and to identify the key remaining issues and future research
              activities needed to resolve them.  Physical oceanographers, meteorologists,
              climatologists and paleoclimatologists will participate in the conference. The
              funds requested from NSF will support ravel expenses for graduate students,
              young scientists and some needy invited speakers and program committee
              members.
