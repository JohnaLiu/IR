Abstract    :
              Power consumption, thermal issues, and battery lifetimes are primary design
              issues in many computer systems.  To address the needs for effective and
              efficient power management in current computer systems, this project studies
              unified methodologies for creating power-aware hardware and software. A key
              underlying philosophy in this work is the notion of "real-power" systems. 
              Drawing an analogy to real-time computer systems, real-power systems seek to
              maintain predictable and manageable levels of power consumption with the best
              possible performance, rather than simply reducing power consumption regardless
              of performance.  A multi-level approach spanning operating systems, compilers,
              and hardware brings leverage to a problem that is difficult to address at the
              hardware level alone.
