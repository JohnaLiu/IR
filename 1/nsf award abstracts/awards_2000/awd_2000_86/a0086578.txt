Abstract    :
              The proposal is to request funding to support, in part, expenses incurred
              towards the organization and conduct of a symposium titled:  Mutation 2000: 
              Mutation Testing in the Twentieth and the Twenty First Century.  This is the
              first symposium of its kind.   Its twin objectives are:  (a) To fuel research
              in the area of Mountain Testing in emerging software technologies.  (b) To
              educate educators, researchers. and practitioners in the principles, technique,
              and use of Mutation Testing.
