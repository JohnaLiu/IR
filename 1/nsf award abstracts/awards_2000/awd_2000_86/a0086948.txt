Abstract    :
              This New Technologies for the Environment exploratory research project proposes
              a novel technology to enable continuous casting of molten metals, in a single
              step, to the specifications of the designer.  To cast aluminum foil, e.g., in a
              single step, would reduce CO2 emissions to the atmosphere by 250,000 tons per
              year, in the US alone.  Every kilogram of aluminum saved in reducing
              manufacturing waste translates into electricity saved at the energy-hungry
              smelter.  The technology is based on controlling length scales previously
              uncontrolled.

Successful casting by design, or `tunable' casting, will use
              substrate modification to manipulate product quality.  The goal is to condition
              the substrate by imposing thermal gradients before the contact zone. 
              Gray-scales in ink-jet printing are produced by the spacing and arrangements of
              ink dots of the same size.  In much the same way, the proposed gradients will
              be established with arrangements and spacing of hot spots. Laser heating will
              induce the hot spots.
