Abstract    :
              Providing and instituting viable outcomes for its students of the 21st Century,
              Fort 
Berthold Schools and Fort Berthold Community College recognize systemic
              reform 
as timely and appropriate for reservation schools. Fort Berthold
              Community College's 
primary commitment as a Phase II participant to systemic
              reform within the Fort 
Berthold Reservation Schools is to continue the
              established improvement of 
mathematics, science, and technology education.
              

Fort Bethold Community College's gains within its home reservation will
              continue 
and maintain its current success through cooperative arrangements
              with tribal, state,
private and federal efforts.  The effort will promote
              consistent and appropriate policies,
community participation, tribal council
              education and commitment and fund resourse
expansion.  All measures of
              achievement and directional assistance will be closely 
evaluated, assessed,
              documented and through test results, data compilation and reports.
