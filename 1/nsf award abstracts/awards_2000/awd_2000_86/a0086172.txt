Abstract    :
              This project would conduct Development-phase activities such as the regional
              self-study, to collect and analyze data aligned with the Systemic Reform
              Drivers.  The data and the associated discussions, resulting in stronger
              partnerships between stakeholders, will be used to formulate the strategies for
              the Implementation phase.  These strategies will then be examined for their
              effectiveness in the rural context.  The primary expected result of the
              Development phase would be an Implementation strategy that will be submitted to
              the RSI program for funding. The conduct of the project will be under the
              guidance of a Steering Committee, composed of individuals who have been working
              on ASSET or one of its related activities.
