Title:
              Information Technology Research: Systems for Learning Science and Assessing
              Student Learning

This five-year project to study science learning in
              authentic, immersive,
virtual environments involving 1) simulated environments
              for teaching
science topics, each framed according to a theoretical approach,
              role-based
learning, 2) an innovative, integrated, distributed software
              platform for
developing and hosting virtual environments, 3) empirical studies
              using an
innovative protocol, scenario-based assessment, for measuring
              student
learning in virtual worlds, and 4) a graduate-level summer school
              course
for in-service teachers who will be trained, beginning in year three,
              to
use virtual environments in their classrooms.  This
              interdisciplinary
project, in part, depends on fundamental computer science
              research in the
areas of distributed systems, software agents and intelligent
              tutoring, and
virtual environments.  The intent of this research is to produce
              a large,
controlled study demonstrating the statistical significance of the
              impact
of the above methods on student learning.
