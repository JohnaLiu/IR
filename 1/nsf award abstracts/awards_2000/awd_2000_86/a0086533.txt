Abstract    :
              West Chester University of Pennsylvania is seeking support to build a Meteorlogy
              Laboratory in its Department of Geology and Astronomy.  The MetLab will give
              students the capability to analyze real and archived weather data in the
              classroom using Unidata software.  Also, the MetLab will provide an extended
              curriculum in meteorology for students to pursuit an education minor in
              meteorology.  With this equipment, further advances will be made to provide
              analytical tools of modern meteorology to pre- and in-service K-12 science
              teachers.
