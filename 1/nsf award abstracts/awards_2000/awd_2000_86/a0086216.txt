Abstract    :
              The 2000 ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Communications Architectures, Protocols and
              Applications will be held in Stockholm, Sweden, from August 28 September 1,
              2000.  This conference is the premier technical meeting that examines the
              state-of-the-art in computer networks and communications.  This proposal
              requests funding to assist 18 United States-based graduate students in
              attending this meeting.  Participation in conferences such as SIGCOMM is an
              extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the
              opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to
              leading edge work in the field. The support requested in this proposal will
              enable the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend
              ACM SIGCOMM 2000.
