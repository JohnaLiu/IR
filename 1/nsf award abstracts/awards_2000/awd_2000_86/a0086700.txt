The objective of this proposal is
              to develop improved engineering approximations for chemical kinetics.  The
              ability to estimate kinetic parameters is of importance to the chemical process
              industry for process design and optimization.  More accurate correlations for
              reaction rate constants will be developed using a combination of ab initio
              quantum mechanics methods and experimental data.  In previous efforts an
              improved correlation for estimating the activation energy of atom transfer
              reactions, requiring one adjustable parameter, was developed.  In the current
              project previous efforts to calculate rates of the general hydrogen abstraction
              reaction will be extended.  Reactions involving various free radicals including
              hydroxyl, alkyl, and chlorine will be examined.  Reactants containing primary,
              secondary, and tertiary carbon-hydrogen bonds will also be studied to fit and
              test the applicability of the model.  Ab initio calculations will be performed
              to determine the activation barriers and the intermolecular forces between
              reactants during reaction.  These calculations will permit an estimate of the
              relative importance of each term in the predicted overall rate.  This work may
              lead to better models for the prediction of kinetic data for use in chemical
              reaction process simulators.
