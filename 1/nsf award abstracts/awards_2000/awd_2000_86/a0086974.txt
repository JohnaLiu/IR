Abstract    :
              As part of Pacific Rocks 2000, the Fourth North American Rock Mechanics
              Symposium (NARMS), the American Rock Mechanics Association (ARMA) Foundation
              with support from the National Science Foundation will hold a one-day workshop,
              Underground Space in the City: Rock Engineering Issues in the Development of
              the Urban Underground Environment on July 30, 2000 at the University of
              Washington in Seattle. The workshop will explore the current international use
              of underground urban space, describe by example unique applications of rock
              mechanics and rock engineering in an urban setting, generate research ideas and
              researchable issues that will foster new innovation in the urban underground
              environment. The ARMA Foundation will produce a report documenting the workshop
              and describing research needs. Proceedings of the workshop will also be
              available. Information on the workshop can be found on the Pacific Rocks page
              of  www.armarocks.org.
