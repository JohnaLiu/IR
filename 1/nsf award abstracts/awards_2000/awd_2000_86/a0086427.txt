Abstract    :
              K-12 schools in South Carolina are implementing new state science standards. As
              a result, many teachers must obtain significantly new content knowledge while
              developing new curricula and lesson plans. This project supports ten graduate
              students majoring in mechanical, chemical, electrical, computer, civil and
              environmental engineering to work with grades 3-9 science teachers and their
              students. Project planning involving school district personnel has identified a
              number of connections between the content knowledge of these engineering
              students and the new science standards for these grades. The graduate fellows
              will help teachers adopt, adapt and develop curriculum and instructional
              materials that use engineering examples, experiments and inquiry and design
              problems. Each fellow will become an expert in one or more area of the
              standards, and will work with several teachers and schools throughout their
              tenure. This plan effectively integrates the fellows' teaching activities with
              their graduate education and research experiences. In addition to the service
              learning activities proposed, the fellows will receive formal instruction on
              teaching principles, cognitive processes and learning styles through a
              field-based course developed by the College of Education. A series of summer
              workshops involving the fellows and participating teachers is also
              proposed.
