Abstract    :
              The proposed exploratory study is to establish the first terrestrial
              high-resolution paleoclimate archive spanning the last 200 years based on a
              tree ring oxygen isotopic record in the tropics. This will be accomplished
              through the analysis of a very unique tree species in Brazil. The oxygen
              isotopic data from this study may be used to infer changes in the isotopic
              composition of soil water that the trees are using, which is directly related
              to precipitation (and thus potentially linked to atmospheric circulation). This
              work will be accomplished using a newly developed methodology for the optimized
              measurement of oxygen isotopes in organic matter. This approach is both novel
              and experimental, yet the results would provide the first annual resolution
              isotopic record of climate change of the last 200 years from Brazil.
