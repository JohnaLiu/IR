Abstract    :
              
The teaching fellows (graduate and senior undergraduates in biology, earth
              sciences, physics andastronomy) will be trained in a summer institute, and then
              paired with grades 3-6 teachers. Inconsultation with Binghamton University
              faculty, the pairs will develop the "research lessons",

test them during the
              academic year in grades 3-6 classrooms and continue to refine them.
              Each66research lesson" is a series of lessons based on the 5E Teaching Cycle
              and with an emphasis on

identifying and challenging misconceptions of
              students in grades 3-6. The "research lessons" willprovide models for
              addressing the new curricula programs of New York State and BinghamtonCity
              Schools, the chosen school district. The "research lessons" will make use of a
              wide varietyof excellent educational materials, and so what the lessons will do
              is provide conceptually linked

and carefully sequenced lessons that
              specifically address the students' misconceptions. A prioritywill be to develop
              the habits and skills of scientific inquiry through demonstrations and
              hands-on

activities. An important outcome is that both the teaching fellows
              and the teachers will learn howto develop, assess and refine "research lessons"
              that target science content, habits and skills instudents.
