Abstract

The objective of
              this proposal is to develop an environmentally benign, novel re-manufacturing
              process to relief the bothersome scratchitti vandalism- permanent scratches on
              the glass surface. In this proposal, an innovative approach, controlled fire
              polishing, will be used. Intensive heat melts only a thin layer of the glass
              panel. During the cooling process, the surface tension will even out the
              scratching indent. The process will enable the reuse of the damaged window/door
              and eliminate the otherwise waste by replacement new glass. It allows a better
              living environment for people, rid of the unpleasant and annoying graffiti
              vandalism.
