This proposal will initiate a second site at the
              University of Cincinnati of the NSF I/UCRC for Membrane Applied Science and
              Technology (MAST) that was established at the University of Colorado in 1990. 
              The MAST Center has focused on polymeric and inorganic membrane formation,
              catalytic membranes, and membrane fouling and characterization.  The proposed
              MAST site at the University of Cincinnati will complement the Colorado site via
              thrusts in biomedical, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, paper industry, and
              personal home care product applications of membranes.  The University of
              Cincinnati has commitments in the amount of $160,000 from four sponsors and has
              an expression of interest from 14 additional companies and government
              laboratories.
