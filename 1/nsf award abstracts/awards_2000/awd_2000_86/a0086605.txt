The Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES)
              Program is a project funded under the NSF Major Research Equipment Program. 
              This cooperative agreement, under the NEES Program, establishes a NEES
              earthquake engineering field experimentation site at the University of Texas
              (UT) at Austin.  UT will design, purchase, construct, install, commission, and
              operate new mobile, large-scale field equipment for geotechnical and structural
              earthquake engineering experimentation.  This equipment will be operational by
              2004 or earlier and will be managed as a national shared-use NEES equipment
              site, with telepresence capabilities, to provide new earthquake engineering
              research testing capabilities through 2014.  This NEES equipment site will be
              connected to the NEES collaboratory through a high performance network. 
              Shared-use access and training will be coordinated through the NEES Consortium.
               This award is an outcome of the peer review of proposals submitted to program
              solicitation NSF 00-6, NEES: Earthquake Engineering Research Equipment. 
              Understanding of the response of near-surface geologic materials to earthquake
              loading is essential to the design of new structures and the remediation of
              existing structures.  Currently, prediction of soil liquefaction and
              subsidence, lateral spreading, and site amplification are based on small-strain
              laboratory and field testing, which does not duplicate the nonlinear strain
              levels that occur during major earthquakes.  Mobile, large-scale field
              equipment will be developed to produce dynamic motion in the ground comparable
              to that produced during earthquakes.  This equipment includes a large
              three-dimensional mobile shaker; two cubical, stand-alone three-dimensional
              shakers; an instrumentation van with field equipment and multi-channel data
              acquisition and processing systems; and communications equipment for
              teleparticipation.   The large, 3-D mobile shaker will have the ability to
              generate up to 267 kN (60,000 lb) of force in the vertical direction over a
              frequency range of 11 to 200 Hz and up to 133 kN (30,000 lb) of force in the
              horizontal direction over a frequency range of 5 to 200 Hz.  The two
              stand-alone cubical shakers will also be able to generate force in either the
              horizontal or vertical direction.  One cubical shaker will generate forces of
              18 kN (4000 lb) over frequencies from 2.6 to 800 Hz, and the other shaker will
              generate forces of 57 kN (12,800 lb) over frequencies from 0.7 to 125 Hz.  They
              will be used inside buildings and on top of liquefiable deposits.  Specific
              instrumentation will include low and high frequency accelerometers, triaxial
              1-Hz geophones, pore pressure transducers, high-speed data acquisition,
              waveform recorder signal processing capabilities, and wireless technology.  The
              equipment will be based at UT, but will be truck mounted and portable for
              relocation throughout the U.S. as NEES shared use equipment.  The equipment
              will be used for: 1) characterizing the nonlinear earthquake performance and
              liquefaction resistance of geomaterials in situ; 2) effective and efficient 3-D
              imaging of significant zones of the geotechnical environment, including depths
              of 300 to 500 m over distances of 1 to 2 km; and 3) investigating and
              documenting the dynamic response of large-scale or full-scale foundations or
              structures in actual geotechnical settings.   Field experiments using this
              equipment will significantly enhance our fundamental knowledge of earthquake
              effects associated with geomaterials, thereby reducing loss-of-life and
              economic losses from future earthquakes. UT will integrate this field equipment
              into its research program and undergraduate and graduate curricula and provide
              training opportunities for outside researchers.
