Abstract    :
                Two major goals are:
(1)  To establish a new-generation integrated
              methodology for real-   time (RT) distributed programming and software
              engineering on    the basis of the recent developments in object-oriented (OO)
              RT
   distributed programming;  and 
(2)  To develop an integrated tool-set
              named the Real-time Object  Network Engineering Environment (RONEE), which will
              bring about  a quantum jump in the system engineers' productivity in

              constructing distributed RT application systems.

The research base of this
              multi-nation researcher team includes (1) a new high-level style of RT OO
              distributed programming called the TMO (Time-triggered Message-triggered
              Object) programming, (2)
middleware supporting RT objects such as TAO object
              request broker and TMOSM, (3) OS and middleware support for fault-tolerant RT
              distributed computing such as ROAFTS and TTP OS, (4) frameworks
such as RT UML
              and ACSR for formal specification, etc.

Specific research tasks include
              integrations of cornerstone
techniques and development of RONEE for:
(1) 
              High-level distributed RT programming based on C++ and JAVA;
(2)  Formal
              multi-level specification of requirements and designs;
(3)  Efficient
              execution of RT objects, stationary and mobile;
(4)  Fault-tolerant computing
              with distributed RT objects;
(5)  Verification of timing designs;
(6) 
              Distributed RT simulation and 3D visualization of application
environments to
              support software validation.
