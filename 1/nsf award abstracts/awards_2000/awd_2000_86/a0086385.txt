Abstract    :
              A Rayleigh lidar system will be deployed to Maui, Hawaii, to measure absolute
              temperatures and relative atmospheric density throughout the stratosphere and
              mesosphere regions in combination with simultaneous observations of upper
              mesosphere and lower thermosphere winds and temperatures carried out by the U.
              of Illinois sodium lidar system.  The 10 watts laser transmitter on loan from
              the Univ. of Illinois would be combined with the 3.7 m USAF-AEOS telescope
              located on Mt. Haleakala to achieve a power aperture product unmatched by any
              other Rayleigh lidar system regularly operating today.  These lidar
              measurements would be supplemented by all sky imaging observations provided by
              the Univ. of Illinois OH intensity imaging system and the Utah State Univ. all
              sky imaging system of temperature and intensity for OH and O2 emissions.  This
              suite of measurements would provide for focused investigations of small-scale
              wave propagation properties within the stratosphere and mesosphere regions. 
              Larger scale dynamical measurements would be possible by combining these
              results with those from the Illinois meteor radar system.
