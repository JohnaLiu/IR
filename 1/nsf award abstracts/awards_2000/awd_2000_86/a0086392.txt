Abstract    :
              For the past year, Georgia State University has successfu  'Ily operated the
              Bio-Bus, a 3 0-foot mobile instructional laboratory that serves Georgia's K- 1
              2 school systems. In partnership with six Georgia School systems (Bremen City,
              Carrollton City, Carroll County, Decatur City, Haralson County, and Paulding
              County), the University proposes to inaugurate the GKI2 Bio-Bus Pilot Project,
              an extension of the main Bio-Bus program that provides additional preparation
              and reinforcement learning experiences not currently available to Bio-Bus
              participants. For the Pilot Project, science graduate students and advanced
              undergraduates chosen as GK12 Fellows will present a selection of learning
              modules to novice learners in their partner districts that incorporate
              scientific inquiry, hands-on investigation, and student-directed learning.
              Though centered around a biological theme, each learning module will take a
              multidisciplinary approach, presenting fundamental physical, chemical and
              geological concepts in a biological context. Summer workshops in biotechnology
              will be provided for in-service teachers and their GKI2 Fellow partners.
              Teachers who complete the summer workshop will qualify for the Bio-Bus Lending
              Lab,. which provides free equipment and supplies for a week's worth of
              biotechnology experiments during the school year.
