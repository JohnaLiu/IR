Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to place undergraduate and graduate students from
              science and engineering at UMCP as teaching Fellows in area middle and high
              schools to enhance and extend the science and mathematics curriculum. The
              conceptual and pedagogical focus of this project is to develop a program in
              which Fellows and teachers work together to integrate learning practices into
              classroom based activities. The Fellows will be drawn from the departments of
              chemistry, physics, materials science and engineering. They will enhance the
              curriculum in collaboration with K-12 teachers to develop classroom hands-on,
              inquiry-based activities that will supplement the curriculum content, by
              integrating programs that connect classroom learning to science and technology
              beyond the classroom. The Fellows will also act as liaisons between teachers
              and university based resources. Through training and direct involvement in
              K-12
schools, Fellows will become knowledgeable in education outreach, and
              will in turn become a resource to the University. It is expected that the GK-
              12 Fellows will develop a broader sense of their professional options, a
              stronger grounding in science and engineering education, and a sense of the
              educational relationships between the university and the community.
