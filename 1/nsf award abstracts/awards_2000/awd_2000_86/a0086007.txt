Abstract    :
              The 1990's have witnessed explosive, if not revolutionary, growth in wireless
              telecommunications, fueled in large measure by the technology scaling of
              digital processing power. Third-generation (3G) wire-less systems promise even
              more with high-bit-rate data services, such as video and Internet access, with
              wide-band spread-spectrum modulation. Yet, despite the continued benefit of
              technology scaling below
0.1am in the next decade, these mobile 3G systems
              will demand digital processing power, along with programmability and energy
              efficiency, which are not achievable with conventional digital design
              techniques.  Reconfigurable and flexible software radios, which implement
              digital IF as well as baseband function, will be essential for 3G systems
              because of the need to support multiple modulation waveforms and multiple air
              interface standards. These systems can be expected to demand 1000 MIPS of
              digital IF-processing
power and up to 2000 MIPS of baseband DSP power. To
              achieve power levels necessary for mobile sys-tem, energy efficiency of better
              than 0.15 mW/MIPS while deliever 3000 MIPS of processing power will be
              necessary, an order of magnitude better than what can be achieve today with
              conventional design practices.  In this extensive three-year  research effort,
              we will consider asynchronous design techniques for
              achieving
energy-efficient, high-performance digital signal processing for 3G
              wireless applications. We will fully exploit the inherent high-performance and
              low-power properties of asynchronous design, to consume power only where needed
              and to "adapt" to the actual data inputs. Specifically, we will combine
              fine-grained asynchronous micropipelines with adaptive (or programmable)
              power-supply control and a dataflow-driven  microarchitecture to provide a
              funcadmental leap in complex programmable digital 
signal processing power and
              energy efficiency, unachievable using existing synchronous techniques. We
              in-tend to develop an asynchronous programmable DSP that is capable of
              supporting a significant fraction of the IS-95 and W-CDMA standards in
              software, including the performance- and power-intensive I and Q modulation and
              demodulation at less than 400 mW of peak power dissipation.
