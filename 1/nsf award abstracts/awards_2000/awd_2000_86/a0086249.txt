              ABSTRACT

Luck, Earle
"NStars: Spectroscopy in the Local Neighborhood: A
              High-Resolution Survey and Abundance Analysis of Selected
              Stars"
AST-0086249

Dr. Luck is conducting a high-resolution survey of about
              150 stars within 15 parsecs of the Sun.  The objective of the project is to
              assemble a high quality database from which the frequency of binary companions,
              spectral peculiarities, and spectrum variability can be assessed.  In addition,
              a detailed abundance analysis is being performed on ~80-100 stars with and
              without planets to determine what role metallicity plays in the frequency of
              planetary formation.  The observations for the project are conducted the
              University of Texas McDonald Observatory 2.1-m telescope.
Funding for this
              project was provided by the NSF Stellar Astronomy & Astrophysics  (AST/SAA)
              program through the joint NSF/NASA "Nearby Stars (NStars)" initiative, and the
              NSF Mathematical & Physical Sciences Directorate Office of Multidisciplinary
              Activities (MPS/OMA).
