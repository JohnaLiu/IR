Abstract    :
              This project studies the integration of heterogeneous resources into a
              system-on-chip (SOC) solution. Heterogeneous SOC integration supports the
              fabrication of RF, analog, high performance digital, and re-configurable
              subsystems within a single piece of silicon, and includes issues of simulation,
              design, integration, test, and education. An example SOC is a human/machine
              transducer chip that provides a speech recognition interface to a ubiquitous
              wireless network. Such a system represents a standard interface modality.
              Multiple topics are being researched including low-power speaker
              identification, speech processing algorithms, and hardware implementations. Low
              power, high performance wireless protocols are also being developed to support
              the asymmetric communication loads, sending low bandwidth control messages
              produced from the recognized speech and receiving high-bandwidth information
              return for visual, audio, and other feedback to the user.
