Title:
              Information Technology Research:   Institute for Quantum Information

An
              interdisciplinary team of researchers in Physics, Applied Physics, Electrical
              Engineering and Computer Science are establishing an Institute for Quantum
              Information (IQI) to facilitate the investigation of quantum information
              science to provide new capabilities in the revolutionary field of quantum
              computing.   To this end, efforts are being made to develop new algorithms for
              the manipulation, processing, and distribution of quantum information
              (including information capacities of communication channels, reliable schemes
              for distributed computation, efficient quantum error correcting codes).  
              Investigations of physical systems for the implementation of quantum
              computation and communication, as well as coherent nanotechnology, principally
              by the way of theoretical models and analysis, are being performed. The team is
              also pursuing techniques to develop active control of quantum effects in
              nanoscale integrated circuits involving systematic approaches to the
              suppression of unwanted quantum effects via on-chip feedback networks and
              methods for stabilizing and exploiting emergent quantum behaviors in the
              context of analog/hybrid VLSI.
