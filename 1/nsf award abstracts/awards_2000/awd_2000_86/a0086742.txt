Abstract    :
              
This award will fund a conference, in March 2001.  This conference will deal
              with a broad spectrum of the theory of quadratic forms, including algebraic
              theory, arithmetic theory, K- theory and algebraic groups.

This is an
              important and broad research area in Number Theory.

There will be
              approximately eight one-hour survey lectures and between twenty-five and thirty
              contributed talks by the participants.
