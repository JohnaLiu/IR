Abstract    :
              0086768  Ma  The objective of this research is to explore the utility of a fern
              in the Pteris genus for arsenic phytoremediation.  The pytoremediation process
              involves transferring the arsenic from contaminated soils to plant tissue.  The
              plants can be periodically removed and disposed of in a low impact manner and
              arsenic removal will, in turn, restore the site for productive uses.  This fern
              is singular in its high ablity to remove arsenic from surrounding soil. 
              Additionally, high sunlight tolerance has been exhibited which bodes well for
              its use for phytoremediation in a wide array of field situations.  In addition
              to the field trials where arsenic removal from soils will be studied, the work
              includes exploring the efficacy of using a patented gasification technology for
              the disposal of the arsenic-rich, plant biomass.  The bulk of the plant mass
              will be gasified leaving a small volume of ash and arsenic for ultimate
              disposal.  This grant is made pursuant to Solicitation NSF 00-49, New
              Technologies for the Environment.***
