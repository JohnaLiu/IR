This U.S.-Mexico award will help to support a meeting on
              quantum chaos, its theory and applications, to be held in Cocoyoc, Mexico, July
              8-13, 2001.  Organized by L. E. Reichl of the University of Texas at Austin and
              G. Luna Acosta of the Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla with T.
              Seligman, J. Flores, and P. Mello of the Universidad Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM),
              the meeting will be a satellite meeting to the larger International Conference
              on Statistical Physics, STATPHYS-21, to be held in Cancun, Mexico, July 15-21,
              2001.

The manifestations of chaos in the quantum dynamics of mesoscopic and
              atomic systems is a topic of growing importance because of the increasing
              variety of experiments in atomic systems and nanometer scale devices in which
              it is now being detected.  Nuclear scattering experiments and atomic spectra,
              atomic systems driven by microwave radiation, very intense laser pulses, and
              electron waveguides made from semiconductor materials furnish examples of these
              phenomena.  This meeting will allow the growing number of researchers and
              students in the U.S., Mexico, and other countries in Latin America, who work in
              these areas, to have a broader exchange of views on these issues and develop
              future collaborative projects.  Convening the meeting close to STATPHYS, which
              attracts experts in the field of quantum chaos and mesoscopic systems from all
              over the world, will serve to enrich the discussion for all participants.
