Abstract    :
              A site description directory, key to activation of group communications,
              provides a basis from which to consider a broader information directory schema
              representing a distributed cognition and an articulated organizational history
              for communities of practice.  This project supports investigations into
              organizational metadata to further the development of a description directory
              for networked research sites with web interfaces providing distributed site
              dada input and access.  The project encompasses testing a three level
              system/sub-system prototype directory, exploring a design applicable to a
              variety of federated networks and system interfaces, as well as incorporating
              elements of social design to enhance organizational effectiveness.  The
              Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network serves as a unique testbed for the
              directory concept.
