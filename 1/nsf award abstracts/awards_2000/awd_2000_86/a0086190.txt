Abstract    :
              The work of the Development phase will coalesce around conducting a regional
              self-study; and establishing the basis and infrastructure upon which the school
              reform will be generated.  Specifically, the Development phase will: establish
              local leadership teams (LLTs), coalition leadership teams (CLTs), and core
              management team (CMT).  These teams--district, regional, and central,
              respectively--will manage the various aspects of the Development phase (e.g.,
              LLTs will spearhead the Self-Study; CLTs will compile and identify resources;
              CMT will coordinate everyone's efforts).
