Abstract    :
              Asynchronous (or clockless) circuits have become the focus of renewed interest
              because of their potential to alleviate a number of challenging problems in
              future-generation chip design: clock distribution, power management, and design
              reuse. To overcome the limitations of current asynchronous design
              methodologies, this project is developing an automated CAD framework for the
              synthesis and optimization of large-scale asynchronous systems.  In addition to
              basic high-level scheduling, binding and allocation, and Hardware Description
              Language support (Verilog HDL), the project is exploring the open and
              challenging problems of:  (a) high-performance pipeline synthesis and
              optimization;  (b) architectural exploration (targeted to the frequent
              common-case operations);  (c) distributed controller synthesis and
              optimization;  (d) system-level performance and power analysis; and  (e) the
              synthesis of mixed asynchronous/synchronous systems. The tool framework is
              being applied to a number of commercial examples and validated through chip
              design, fabrication, and test.
