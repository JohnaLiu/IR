"NStars: High-resolution Spectroscopy of Nearby
              Stars"



Dr. Lambert is conducting a detailed study of absorption line
              asymmetries and wavelength shifts in the spectra of stars using realistic
              three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations.  He is working to quantify the
              effects of convective motions and the resulting surface irregularities on
              measurements of radial velocity, photocentric stability, chemical composition
              and other basic stellar parameter measurements so that the data on nearby stars
              can be corrected for these effects.  Some of the ultra-high resolution spectra
              needed for this project are obtained at the University of Texas McDonald
              Observatory.
Funding for this project was provided by the NSF Stellar
              Astronomy & Astrophysics  (AST/SAA) program through the joint NSF/NASA "Nearby
              Stars (NStars)" initiative, and the NSF Mathematical & Physical Sciences
              Directorate Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (MPS/OMA).
