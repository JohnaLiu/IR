Abstract    :
              
The NDSU Graduate Student-University-School (GraSUS) Collaborative for
              Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology is a project in which graduate
              and advanced undergraduate students (fellows)will work with science and
              mathematics teachers in grade 6-12 classrooms. The project uses problem-or
              inquiry-based learning, in which solutions of interesting real -life problems
              promote students' learning, problem-solving skills, creative thinking, and
              teamwork. Challenging problems will be selected to reflect existing school
              curriculum in the context of the research and applications from core SMET
              disciplines at the university. The school courses involved include mathematics,
              general science, environmental science, chemistry, physics and biology.
              Real-life applications in these areas will come from the same disciplines and
              from several engineering, agricultural, and technology disciplines. The
              graduate and undergraduate
fellows will receive pedagogical training. Summer
              workshops will involve school teachers and university faculty in planning and
              development activities with the fellows. The project's expected outcomes
              include enhanced communication and teaching skills for the fellows, enriched
              learning by K- 12 students,
professional development opportunities for K- 12
              teachers, and stronger partnerships between NDSU and local school districts.
              This project will build upon several other similar and successful programs at
              NDSU.
