The objective of this program is to develop and construct a
              prototype clinical confocal microscopy system capable of non-invasively
              obtaining images of cellular microstructure in internal human organ systems.
              The scanning techniques currently used in laser confocal microscopy are not
              readily adaptable to the dimensions and constraints of medical endoscopes. 
              Spectrally encoded confocal microscopy (SECM), a technique developed in this
              laboratory, uses a broad bandwidth light source and a diffraction grating to
              simultaneously illuminate multiple points along a transverse line within a
              sample and to detect reflected light from these points.  Since this method does
              not require fast spatial scanning mechanisms within the probe, it is capable of
              being miniaturized and incorporated into a catheter or endoscope.  Special
              emphasis will be placed on developing an endoscopic confocal microscopy imaging
              system that is clinically viable, and can potentially be applied to
              applications ranging from screening for dysplasia to intra-operative tumor
              margin detection.  In addition, this imaging modality could be used for basic
              science applications to investigate the pathophysiology of disease processes at
              a cellular level in situ.
