Abstract    :
              This project will establish a transdisciplinary working group, and ultimately, a
              Center on Social Neuroscience at The University of Chicago. This working group,
              guided by the PI and a nine member steering committee, will involve faculty
              from several departments in the Biological Sciences, the Social Sciences, and
              Physical Sciences Graduate Divisions of the University. A wide range of levels
              of analysis and a diverse array of methodologies will be represented, including
              functional magnetic resonance imaging, surface event-related brain potential
              morphological and topographical analyses, indwelling (within the brain)
              event-related brain potential analyses, coregistration and source localization,
              computational neuroscience (including nonlinear dynamical analyses),
              neuropsychology and behavioral neurology, psychopharmacology, autonomic
              psychophysiology, surface electromyography and startle blink modulation,
              kinematic analyses, behavioral and social endocrinology, cognitive psychology,
              social cognition, and experimental social psychology. In the first year, a
              series of internal and external speakers and meetings will be held to develop a
              common scientific language, grounded in the structure and function of the
              brain, and to examine the strengths and limitations of each of the available
              methodologies. In the second year, the focus of the meetings, formal
              presentations, and workshops will build on this base to include theories of and
              experimental paradigms for studying problems confronting our society such as
              learning, stereotyping and prejudice. Pilot research will be conducted to test
              specific hypotheses about the neural substrates of the component processes
              underlying stereotyping and prejudice.
