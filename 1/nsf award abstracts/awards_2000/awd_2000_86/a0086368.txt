The objective of this project is to explore a new methodology
              to increase the spatial resolution of optical microscopy and spectroscopy.  The
              instrument to be developed holds promise for gaining deeper insight into the
              functionality of nanometric structures embedded in complex environments such as
              single proteins in biological membranes.

It is propose to develop a high
              resolution near-field optical microscope based on the effect of surface
              enhanced Raman scattering.  In this technique, a sharp noble metal tip is held
              in close proximity over the sample surface.  Properly polarized laser light
              illuminates the tip and induces a strong surface charge density at the tip. 
              This leads to an enhancement of the exciting laser field.  Rigorous
              calculations show that the intensity of the optical fields at the tip can be
              enhanced by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude over the intensity of the exciting laser
              light.  The enhanced field at the tip enables a highly localized optical
              interaction with the sample surface thereby generating a Raman signal and thus
              a vibrational spectrum of the sample area right beneath the tip.
