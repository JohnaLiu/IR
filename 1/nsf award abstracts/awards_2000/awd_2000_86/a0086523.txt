Abstract    :
              The State University of New York at Stony Brook is requesting support to
              purchase a weather ingest computer, disk space, a Proxima projector display
              system, and a PC workstation.  The equipment will be used to establish an
              11-seat meteorological computational  and visualization laboratory for
              undergraduate education and research. This equipment will allow SUNY to serve
              as aa dedicated data acquisition site for the Unidata community and serve as a
              real-time data distribution site.  SUNY's meteorology department will be able
              to continue its growth in atmospheric sciences and enhance educational
              instruction and research opportunities for students and faculty.
