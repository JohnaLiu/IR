Abstract    :
              
The Electromechanical Systems Laboratory (EMSyL) is an existing consortium
              composed of the University of Alabama, Auburn University, the University of
              Tulsa, Shelton State Community College (with HBCU status), and the Alabama
              School of Mathematics and Science.  The EMSyL industrial partners are: 
              Bartronics (minority owned), Honeywell, T.B. Kim Technologies International,
              Lockheed Martin, Moog, and Preco Industries.  The federal partners in EMSyL are
              Oak Ridge National Laboratories and NASA - Glenn Research Center.  The
              consortium is presently in the first year of a two-year NSF/EPSCoR standard
              grant.  EMSyL represents a vast collection of resources, both human and
              capital, that provides a unique opportunity to tackle the complex issues
              associated with the proliferation of electromechanical systems in industry.
