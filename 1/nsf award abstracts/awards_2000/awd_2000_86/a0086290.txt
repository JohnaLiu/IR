Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Society Symposium on Solid State Chemistry of Inorganic
              Materials III will be held in Boston, MA November 27 - December 1, 2000.  The
              goal of the conference is to facilitate multidisciplinary interactions and
              information exchange within a broad spectrum of researchers, to include CAREER
              grantees, and top postdoctoral scholars and graduate students working in
              priority areas of the broad field of solid-state chemistry.  The NSF funds will
              be used exclusively to offset the expenses associated with attending the
              symposium for graduate students and post doctoral scholars, junior faculty and
              selected plenary speakers in the area of solid state chemistry of inorganic
              materials.

The Solid State Chemistry community continues to have direct
              impact on important technological areas that are crucial to advancing society
              through the design, synthesis and application new materials.  Examples include
              porous strength composite structural materials.  Since these technical areas
              are of very high priority to industry, students educated and trained in these
              multidisciplinary areas involving solid-state chemistry compete very well in
              the job market and go on to contribute in many significant ways to the global
              economy.
