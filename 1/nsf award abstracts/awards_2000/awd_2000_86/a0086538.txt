This grant provides support to Ed Ripley and a graduate
              student at the University of Indiana to conduct stable isotopic, trace
              elemental and compositional analysis of rocks associated with the Voisey's Bay
              massive sulfide deposit in Labrador, Canada.  The Voisey's Bay deposit is one
              of the largest economically viable nickel deposits in the world today. Previous
              preliminary studies by the PI in collaboration with Tony Naldrett (Univ.
              Toronto) have indicated that mineralization of this deposit, though sulfide
              saturation,  appears to have been caused by contamination of the magmatic
              intrusion by country rocks.  Nonetheless, a smoking gun has not yet been found.
               This study would expand on previous research by adding high resolution stable
              isotopic analyses of sulfur, oxygen and carbon from multiple whole rock and
              mineral separate samples taken from the low-sulfur county rock and
              unmineralized and mineralized portions of the deposit to elucidate the source
              of sulfur responsible for sulfide saturation within the deposit.
