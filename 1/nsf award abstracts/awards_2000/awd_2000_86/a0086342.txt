This Pan-American Advanced Institutes award, jointly supported
              by the NSF and the Department of Energy (DOE), will consist of a series of
              lectures and research interactions on physics and technology at the nanometer
              scale.  The course will be held in Alajueata, Costa Rica June 21-30, 2001. 
              Lecturers for the PASI will be selected from an international advisory
              committee consisting of top researchers in the area and will come from a broad
              selection of countries and institutions in the continent.  Because most of the
              research at the nanoscale crosses traditional disciplinary boundaries, the
              organizers have chosen to cover topics in five major areas: self-organized
              semiconductor nanostructures; carbon nanotubes, buckyballs, and molecules,
              materials and electronic transport; magnetic nanostructures; structure and
              epitaxy of low-dimensional systems; and theory of low-dimensional systems:
              transport, optical properties, and correlation/interaction effects.  The course
              will combine lectures with poster sessions for the presentation of research
              studies and results by junior and other participants in order to foster
              content-specific interactions.  These interactions should be helpful in laying
              the groundwork for future collaborations.
