The broad, long term objective of the proposed research is to
              develop a high speed noninvasive endoscopic functional optical coherence
              tomographic (OCT) system using microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology
              for early diagnosis of tumors in gastrointestinal (GI), respiratory, and
              urogenital tracts.  Functional optical coherence tomography uses coherent
              gating techniques to obtain information on tissue structure and blood flow
              dynamics at discrete spatial locations in highly scattering biological tissues.
               The exceptionally high spatial resolution (2~10 mm) of functional OCT allows
              noninvasive imaging of both in vivo tissue structure and blood flow dynamics
              simultaneously.  The applicants propose to combine the advances in biomedical
              imaging and MEMS technology to develop a high speed, compact, and fast
              endoscopic functional OCT with a miniaturized probe.  This is a collaborative
              project that involves principal investigators with expertise in biomedical
              optics, endoscopic imaging, and silicon and polymer MEMS technology.
