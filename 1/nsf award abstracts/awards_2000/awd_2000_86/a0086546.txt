Abstract    :
              Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University requests support to modernize its
              meteorology centers located in Florida and Arizona.  The upgraded centers will
              enhance undergraduate instruction in meteorology and aviation weather as wells
              as graduate education and scientific research.  ERAU seeks to acquire two high
              capacity Unix servers to perform data ingest functions and to serve data to
              multiple workstations at both weather centers and the entire university.  Along
              with the Unix servers, the purchase of additional hardware will increase the
              data hard disk space and provide a tape drive and CD-writing devices for
              on-line storage and permanent archiving of data. This equipment will further
              enhance the education and training of students in cross interdisciplinary
              research across ERAU departments and campuses.
