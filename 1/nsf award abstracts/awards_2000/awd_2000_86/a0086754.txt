This project involves the study of the use of novel cross-linked
              amphophilic polymer nano-particles in the removal of hydrophobic organic
              pollutants from contaminated soil.  The experimental effort will be directed
              toward polymer synthesis, polymer characterization, and laboratory evaluations
              of the fate and transport of amphiphilic polymer networks in porous media, and
              of their efficacy in the removal of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
              compounds that will be employed as model hydrophobic organic contaminants. 
              Polymer networks can be prepared in nano-size scale by cross-linking droplets
              in an oil-in-water suspension.  Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that
              polymer nano-particels have advantages over surfactants in soil remediation
              including low adsorption onto soil and greater extent of removal of PAHs.
