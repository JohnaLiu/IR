Udwadia
This award supports Firdaus E. Udwadia, and up to 15 other
              researchers to attend a workshop on Dynamics and Control to be held October
              9-11, 2000 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Special emphasis will be given to the
              topics of the use of analytical mechanics in control theory, control of
              uncertain systems, and applications to control of nonlinear dynamical systems. 
              U.S. participants will be chosen from a broad range of universities and
              geographic locales.  The workshop will bring together expert senior and junior
              researchers from Europe, the United States, and the Americas and answers a need
              for increased interaction in this field between scientists from those areas. 
              It also addresses a need to bring pure and applied mathematicians together to
              combine their approaches to particular problems that will require a combined
              effort if they are to be solved.  The workshop is also expected to lead to new
              collaborations between scientists from the participating regions.  The
              government of Brazil also intends to support participation by providing travel
              for a selection of European participants and lodging for all participants.
