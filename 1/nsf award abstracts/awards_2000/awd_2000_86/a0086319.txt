Abstract    :
              This US-Brazil award will support a planning visit by Drs. R. Bowen Loftin and
              Elizabeth Bollinger of the University of Houston to travel to Concepcion,
              Chile, in order to plan a collaborative research project with Arquitecto Emilio
              Armstrong Delpin. The topic of this research is the development of a prototype
              computing/interactive display system for a Virtual Interactive Science Museum. 
              The system would be made available to students via the Education 2000 Internet
              Enlaces project of the Ministry of Education in Chile.

Studying the
              development and impact of the Virtual Interactive Science Museum on Chilean
              children in public schools should offer insights on culturally and
              linguistically relevant pedagogies for informal education.  Other likely
              benefits are the diffusion of results for use in U.S. public schools and
              museums, culturally and linguistically relevant pedagogies for U.S. Latino
              populations, drivers for research in the computer and information sciences and
              engineering, and advances in learning science and technologies.  One compelling
              indirect benefit of the collaboration is the development of new strategies for
              international collaboration regarding the intersection of technology- and
              education-related topics.
