Abstract    :
              Physics (13) Modern society is increasingly reliant on technologies developed
              from the optical sciences. In order to sustain growth in these fields, there is
              a need for people with technical skills in this area and for professionals with
              knowledge of basic optical phenomena. To address these societal needs, the goal
              of this project is to improve the Optics education that students receive
              throughout the Physics curriculum. To implement this goal, we have established
              three objectives for this project: 1) Integrate a hands-on laboratory
              experience including the topics of nonlinear optics, laser design,
              spectroscopy, and optical communication technology into the Optics course for
              Physics majors. 2) Develop Optics-based summer coursework for high school
              teachers as part of the Master of Science in Education program with
              opportunities for teachers to design their own classroom activities. 3) Create
              a new liberal arts course called The Science of Light to give non-science
              majors the opportunity to explore optical phenomena such as vision, liquid
              crystals, color, and holography. These objectives impact not only university
              students, but also high school science teachers and their students. Each of
              these objectives are being met by implementing activities which integrate
              modern optical technology throughout the Physics curriculum. The project is
              adapting experiments from the physics research and education literature and
              adapting more common experiments for use by teachers and their students.
