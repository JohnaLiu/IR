This award supports a two year project to investigate the
              dynamics of the marginal zone of the Siple Coast ice streams using existing
              velocity and temperature profiles.  The flow and stress fields will be modeled
              using finite element methods and a thermo-mechanical model will be used to
              investigate the coupling of the flow and temperature fields.  Direct comparison
              of these models with the observed velocity profiles will lead to estimates of
              the structure of the margins and the softening of the marginal ice.  The
              distribution of basal and marginal shear stress will be investigated, leading
              to an estimate of the relative roles of the bed and the margins in the overall
              force balance of the ice streams.
