This two-year award, which supports U.S.-Italy cooperative
              research on using product imaging techniques to investigate molecular dynamics,
              involves Paul Houston of Cornell University and his students and Domenico
              Stranges and Anna Giardini of the University of Rome, La Sapienza. The
              objectives of their research are to study cluster photodissociations using a
              combination of resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization, time-of-flight mass
              spectrometry, and product imaging to provide a coherent picture of the
              energetics and dymanics of the cluster.
 
The U. S. investigator brings to
              this collaboration his group's improved imaging system using ion counting
              techniques in conjunction with velocity mapping. This is complemented by the
              Italian investigators' expertise in photofragment translational spectrometry
              and cluster photodissociation. The results of this research are expected to
              uncover new physical phenomena of importance for practical purposes.
