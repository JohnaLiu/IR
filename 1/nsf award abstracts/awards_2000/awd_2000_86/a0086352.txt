In April 1999, a class 5 tornado struck north of Cincinnati,
              Ohio. This storm destroyed approximately one half of the 65 acre
              Benedict/Hazelwood Botanical Preserve. This event provides an opportunity for a
              number of studies on ecosystem recovery following a catastrophic natural
              disturbance. The blow-down area has been managed minimally and most of the area
              has been left relatively undisturbed for studies of forest recovery. This SGER
              study is directed at the first post-disturbance generation of several animal
              species (invertebrates and vertebrates; primary and secondary consumers) that
              have been subjected to environmental stress fro a major ecosystem catastrophe
              during their development. This study concerns the question of whether
              environmental stress from habitat destruction will have an impact on
              developmental instability. The investigators will use a frequently-cited
              indicator of environmental stress - measures of fluctuating asymmetry, or FA
              (small, random deviations from perfect left-right symmetry in bilaterally
              symmetrical animals) - as a means of determining impact of disturbance on
              animal populations. Recent studies with forest-dwelling animal populations have
              demonstrated that FA is increased in populatoins undergoing interruptions in
              food, or in areas where vegetation is removed by logging. This is the first
              study of FA associated with environmental stress from a major natural
              catastrophe. This SGER research represents a unique opportunity to increase our
              knowledge about the response of animal populations to a rare but severe natural
              disturbance.
