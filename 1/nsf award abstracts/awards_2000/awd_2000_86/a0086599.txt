Abstract    :
              The PIs proposes to conduct a workshop to bring together groups of researchers
              that do not regularly interact but all deal with cutting-edge scientific issues
              related to root-soil biology.  The objective is to find common ground in the
              search for key processes and control points that regulate interactions of
              organisms and molecules in the rhizosphere. The importance of the rhizosphere
              to ecology, agriculture and plant biology is undisputed.  The root-soil
              interface is a research frontier where scientists from separate disciplines,
              ranging from ecology to molecular biology, use contemporary techniques to
              pursue complementary goals.  Progress will be made in this research area by
              establishing communication across the spectrum of diverse disciplines
              represented by rhizosphere biologists.
