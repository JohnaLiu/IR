Abstract    :
              North Carolina State University (NCSU) requests support to replace its outdated
              equipment.  Specifically, NCSU proposes a one-time upgrade to a SUN Ultra-60
              with a single 450 MHz processor, and 1 GB RAM.  With the new upgrade, students
              will be trained in the latest weather analysis techniques and be able to
              develop case studies for research in important meteorological problems. 
              Various studies of East Coast weather phenomena will use the observations and
              model data.  Furthermore, the real-time mesoscale models that focus on the
              local area will  be very useful in solving forecasting problems.
