Paleosols are increasingly used as paleoclimate
              indicators.  Preliminary work by the PI and colleagues has suggested that the
              climate calibration of modern soils may not be as robust as previously thought.
               If paleosols need to be reexamined more closely as paleoclimatic indicators,
              then that must take place as soon as possible.  This is because the impact on
              ongoing deep-time paleoclimatic studies may be profound and the wider community
              should have this information just as soon as possible.  This project will use
              large-scale databases to address this problem.
