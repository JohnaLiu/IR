Abstract    :
              This project involves Earlham College undergraduates in the study
              of
differences in proton and neutron behavior in exotic nuclei. Proton
and
              neutron contributions to excited states can be disentangled by
comparing
              experimental measurements that have different
sensitivities to protons and
              neutrons. The advent of radioactive
beam technology has enabled such
              investigations of nuclei away from
stability via inverse kinematics proton
              scattering, electromagnetic
lifetime measurements, and Coulomb excitation. The
              focus of this
project is on collective excitations in N=8 and Z=8 single
              closed
shell nuclei. Three measurements are planned, a gamma-ray
              lifetime
measurement of the first excited state of Ne-18 at Florida
              State
University (FSU) and inverse kinematics proton scattering
measurements
              of the first excited states of Neon-18 and Oxygen-22 at
the National
              Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). The
project will span three years
              and involve one to two students for
8-10 weeks per summer. Participants will
              to travel to the NSCL or
FSU to perform experiments and will analyze the data
              at Earlham.
