This project has two components: The first part of this
              project is to study the violent activity 
in the central regions of very
              distant galaxies and quasars. The centers of these objects can be more
              brilliant than a thousand normal galaxies, and are the most violent and
              energetic objects in the universe.  Enormous amounts of energy are generated by
              stars and gas falling into a  super-massive black hole that may weigh as much
              as a billion suns. Much of the energy is focused into jets of matter moving at
              nearly the speed of light. These jets radiate visible light, x-rays and radio
              waves, which can be observe. This work aims to determine what the jets are made
              of, and how  they are focused. The ultimate goal is to understand better the
              physics of massive black holes, and how they generate energy.

The second
              part of this project is to use these same quasars and galaxies to measure how
              fast the universe is expanding. They are so bright that they can be seen almost
              to the edge of the observable universe, and back in time to when the universe
              was very young. This project will use a new and direct way of measuring the
              distances to these quasars and galaxies. The hope is that, when combined with
              measurements of their speed away from us, these will determine if the expansion
              rate of the universe is speeding up or slowing down. The result is important
              for finding the age of the universe, and for understanding the earliest history
              of the universe.
Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for
              Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).
