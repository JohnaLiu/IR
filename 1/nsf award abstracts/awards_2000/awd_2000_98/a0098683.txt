AST- 0098683

This is a deep optical follow-up to the Chandra
              Multi-wavelength Plane  survey made by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The
              primary objective is to measure stars and black holes in binary stars within
              the Galaxy. The survey is about 100 times more sensitive than ROSAT and will
              enable complete samples to be measured over 5-10 Kpc galactic scales. This
              survey has been granted archival status by Chandra and Long Term Survey status
              by the National Optical Astronomy Observatories. Deep wide-field images will be
              obtained with the MOSAIC camera at CTIO and KPNO over the next 5 years in R,
              H-alpha, V, and I bands for the purpose of source identification. There will be
              approximately 100 deep Chandra fields available for analysis.
