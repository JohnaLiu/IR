Abstract    :
              The Eigth International Symposium on Particles, Strings, and Cosmology
will be
              held in Chapel Hill, NC April 10-15, 2001. This conference will
bring together
              leaders of the fields of elementary particle physics,
string theory (which is
              a candidate for a theory that encompasses all of
the basic forces of nature),
              and cosmology. The exchange of ideas is
expected to lead to fresh insights and
              to the beginnings of new scientific
projects.
