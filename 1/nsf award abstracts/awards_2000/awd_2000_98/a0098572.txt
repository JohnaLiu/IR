Abstract    :
              This research centers around three investigations that will make use of two
              properties of gravitational lenses: 1) background galaxies are distorted 
              tangentially around foreground galaxies (lenses), and 2) background galaxies
              are boosted in flux by foreground galaxies.  The first study will use an
              existing wide-field survey to characterize individual galaxy dark halos via
              galaxy-galaxy lensing.  The second will test whether the dark matter profile
              hypothesized for clusters of galaxies can simultaneously reproduce weak lensing
              shear and cluster velocity dispersions.  The third will investigate the
              mid-infrared photometric properties of a set of normal star-forming galaxies at
              redshifts of 0.5-1 that have been strongly amplified by galaxy clusters,
              focussing on the emission features of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
