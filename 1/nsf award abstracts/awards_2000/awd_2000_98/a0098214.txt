Abstract    :
              In this project, the PI plans to investigate the `continuation' properties of
              the invariant subspaces of the backward shift operator on various spaces of
              analytic functions on the unit disk.  In 1970, Douglas, Shapiro, and Shields
              showed that functions belonging to these invariant subspaces of the Hardy space
              posses special continuation properties to the exterior disk. In more recent
              investigations, this idea of `continuation' has been shown to be ubiquitous in
              that it appears to take place, in one form or another, in many other settings
              belong the Hardy space case. This proposal plans to get at the heart of the
              nature of these continuations and why they occur in the first place. 

This
              project falls under the broad heading of the field of mathematical analysis
              which, besides its beauty and elegance, makes many connections and has its
              roots in problems connected with physics and engineering. In fact, the concept
              of `continuation' properties of analytic functions has been recently studied by
              the engineer S. Darlington who connected these `continuations' to properties of
              electrical circuit design.
