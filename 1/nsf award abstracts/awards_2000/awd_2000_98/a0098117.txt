Abstract    :
              In order to maintain the spectacular rates of growth in the semiconductor
              industry over the past three decades, it will be necessary in the future to
              move away from the most traditional ways of building VLSI circuits.  This
              research will explore problems in this domain.  The main thrust of the research
              is related to providing design automation support for circuits using silicon 
              on insulator (SOI) technology, although some aspects of the work will have
              applicability to the widely used bulk CMOS technology.  This research will
              develop SOI-specific synthesis techniques, as well as optimization techniques
              that enable the designer to exploit technologies such as dual threshold
              voltages.  Issues related to related to physical design will also be
              considered.
