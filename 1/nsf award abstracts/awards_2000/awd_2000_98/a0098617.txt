For the
              first time in history there is an adequate sample of stars to use as probes in
              deciphering the initial phases of galactic evolution. Surveys for extremely
              metal-poor stars, carried out in the 1990s, produced this sample. During this
              period of the present award, large telescopes their spectrographs will be used
              to determine accurate chemical abundances and thus to trace how heavy element
              synthesis has proceeded since earliest times. There will be additional
              benefits. Thorium abundances can be used to compute radiogenic ages for the
              oldest stars, which will put a lower limit on the age of the universe.  The
              different contributions of s-process elements (generated in the interiors of
              evolving stars) and r-process elements (contributed by supernovae explosions of
              earlier generations of massive stars) will be assessed and compared with
              expectations from nucleosynthesis theory. A search will be made for Population
              III stars that are predicted to show extreme carbon enhancements without
              accompanying s-process excesses. Observations will also be made of stars
              belonging to galactic globular clusters in the outer halo and of stars in
              nearby dwarf galaxies to search for possible abundance signatures
              characteristic of chemical evolution in low-mass galaxies.
