Small telescopes
              are the instrument of choice for variable star photometry which, by its nature,
              requires synoptic observations covering long time bases. Such facilities are
              largely unavailable at major observatories and increasingly, amateur observers
              are doing work of this nature with small telescopes. A number of factors have
              accelerated this trend. (1) Cheaper telescopes. (2) Cheaper two-dimensional
              detectors. (3) Sophisticated software that is readily available. On the other
              hand, the major observatories are becoming more specialized with only scarce,
              and mostly shared time being available on large telescopes with expensive
              instrumentation. The PI has assembled a worldwide network of small photometry
              telescopes to provide the photometry for cataclysmic variable stars.
              Understanding these stars requires measuring the orbital periods of these
              binary stars along with period changes when they occur. Up-to-date ephemerides
              are essential when spectroscopic observation with large telescopes are being
              planned. During the course of this award, the PI will supervise a team of
              graduate and undergraduate students who will carry out the reductions and
              evaluations of the data provided by the worldwide amateur network. In addition,
              he  will lead the analysis and publication of the results as they become
              available.
