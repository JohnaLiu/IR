The most massive
              stars are predestined to end their active lives with a supernova outburst.
              Prior to this terminal event, such a star undergoes substantial mass loss
              through radially driven winds that are many orders of magnitude stronger than
              those associated with stars of smaller mass like the Sun. It is important to
              understand how these winds operate, not only because of their part in
              transferring matter and energy into the interstellar medium but also because of
              the need to fix the initial parameters of the supernova explosion which itself
              in turn will enrich the interstellar medium with matter and with energy
              generated deep in the stellar interior. During the course of this award, the PI
              and his student. will explore those factors which lead to the extremely large
              mass loss rates in Wolf-Rayet stars. The plan is to work from the assumption
              that the major opacity factor is the wavelength distribution of the absorption
              lines in the expanding stellar atmosphere. Detailed calculations will be
              carried out to see how this drives the extreme mass loss from these
              stars.
