High resolution spectroscopic
              observations of quasars often show multiple emission-line and absorption-line
              features which are identified as the resonance line of Lyman Alpha (Lya ) which
              originates in clouds of hydrogen gas at different redshifts located between the
              observer and the quasar itself. These redshifted Lya lines can be used to map
              structure in the high-redshift universe (since the redshift gives position
              along the line of sight). This theoretical research program will show how
              correlations along multiple lines of sight in the observed Lya  absorption
              lines and correlations between different tracer populations (such as narrow
              absorption lines, emission lines from diffuse hydrogen, and broad absorption
              lines) can tighten cosmological constraints and elucidate the physics of quasar
              and galaxy formation. The research will use hydrodynamic cosmological
              simulations, collisionless N-body simulations, and numerically calibrated
              analytic approximations to obtain predictions of current theoretical models,
              which can be tested against observational studies of multiple tracer
              populations in the same spatial volumes. In sum, the proposed research program
              will provide the theoretical development needed to motivate, design, analyze,
              and interpret multi-tracer studies of high-redshift structure.
