This project continues the ongoing program to develop
              the fundamental theory of nuclear and other many-Particle systems, with
              application to astrophysical and condensed matter systems.  Nuclear studies
              emphasize nuclear structure, hadronic structure, electromagnetic properties of
              the nucleon, and properties of nuclear matter. Research on heavy-ion collisions
              ranges from studies of the nuclear equation of state to the developing area of
              ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions.  The emphasis in astrophysics is on
              applying nuclear theory to neutron stars and nuclear reaction in the cosmos,
              with the aim of explaining observations and using observations to learn the
              properties of matter.  Topics in condensed matter physics include Bose-Einstein
              condensation of excitons in semiconductors and in magnetically trapped atomic
              systems.
