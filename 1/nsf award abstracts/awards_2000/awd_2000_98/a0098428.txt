Abstract    :
              It has long been recognized that the stars and star clusters of the halo of our
              Galaxy are the oldest populations in the Milky Way, and therefore hold
              important clues to its earliest period of evolution.  Despite decades of work
              on the halo population, little is known about its structure and its kinematics
              at large distances from the galactic center.  It is not known, for example, if
              the distant halo is spherical or flattened, or if instead of a smooth density
              distribution, it is crisscrossed with stellar streams of debris from tidally
              destroyed satellite galaxies.  These questions and related ones will be
              investigated by Dr. Robert Zinn, of Yale University, using the data collected
              by the QUEST survey for RR Lyrae variable stars.  

The QUEST camera is a 4x4
              array of 2048x2048 CCDs mounted at the prime focus of the 1.0 meter clear
              aperture Schmidt telescope at the Llano del Hato Observatory in Venezuela. 
              Science-grade data have been taken continuously since November 1998, including
              some data for the RR Lyrae survey that will be concluded with this award.  The
              preliminary data have demonstrated the feasibility of the complete survey,
              which is intended to cover a total of 700 square degrees of the sky.
