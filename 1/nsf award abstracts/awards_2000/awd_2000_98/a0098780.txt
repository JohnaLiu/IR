Abstract    :
              The PI plans to finish the preparation of hybrid inorganic ceramic materials and
              electrically conductive polyaniline.  The ceramic materials are porous
              zeolites(zeolite 13X and zeolite 5A) and montmorillonite clays. 
              Interpenetrating polymer networks of poly(2,6-methyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) and
              polyaniline as well as polyurethane foams coated internally with polyaniline
              will be prepared and by transmission and scanning differential calorimetry, DC
              electrical conductivities, and E.S.R. spectroscopy to determine also their
              magnetic properties.  Theoretical studies of a number of equilibrium and
              non-equilibrium density functional studies related to polymers as well as
              investigations of some transport problems related to polymer viscosity, will be
              completed.
