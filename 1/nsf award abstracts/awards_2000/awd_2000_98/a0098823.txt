SUMMARY: 
	For over twenty
              years the Greater Boston Logic meeting has met every odd-numbered year at MIT. 
              Each Meeting is a chance for young mathematical logicians, graduate students,
              and post-docs to hear about and to discuss current work in  mathmetical logic. 
              The National Science foundation  has provided critical support for this effort
              for at least twelve years.

	In addition to invited talks by senior
              logicians, a large number of short contributed talks is given by younger
              logicians.  Space and time are set aside for informal discussions.  Women and
              minorities are invited to participate.  Approximately 100 people are expected
              to attend the meeting.
