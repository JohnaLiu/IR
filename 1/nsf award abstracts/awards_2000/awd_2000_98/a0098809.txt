Abstract    :
               One of the major quests of Kim's research project is to investigate stable
              relations occurred in simple structures. Major problem is to know when the
              simple structure has generic stable reduct. A generic stable reduct of a simple
              structure is the definitional stable reduct preserving forking independence. If
              a stable reduct of a simple structure is found, then every problem is reduced
              to the stable context from the simple context. Hence then stationarity can be
              used, which will resolve many open problems such as definable infinite group
              existence in 1-based structures, and group configuration problems. Unlike the
              well-known  opposite process of constructing simple structures from stable
              structures, questions on finding stable fragments in simple structures seem to
              be rather difficult.

Over the last 3 to 4 decades, model theorists have
              worked on stable structures. Kim's thesis in 1996 opened new research areas in
              model theory enlarging the scope of  study of stable structures. Namely he
              proved the fundamental notion of independence in stable structures also exists
              in the wider class of structures, called simple. After then the study of simple
              structures takes place one of the major research area in model theory, and
              grows rapidly. Kim's continued work on simple structures will deepen and
              strengthen the model theoretic understanding of mathematical structures more.
