Dr. Anthony Readhead and colleagues at the California
              Institute of Technology will continue to use the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI)
              to make observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) on
              angular scales of 3 arc minutes to 0.5 degrees.  The CBI is located in the
              Chilean Andes at an altitude of 5000 meters.  The prime objective of the CBI
              project is to measure the angular power spectrum of the CMBR over the multipole
              moment range l=400 to 3000.  An additional program will be carried out to
              measure secondary fluctuations in the CMBR caused by the scattering of the CMBR
              photons off the hot electrons in clusters of galaxies - the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
              Effect.  A complete sample of 19 nearby clusters will be observed with the CBI,
              and these observations will be combined with X-ray observations to determine
              the Hubble Constant with 10% accuracy.  The team includes graduate students and
              post-doctoral fellows. This work addresses a fundamental area of science with a
              state-of-the-art instrument and is expected to make a significant contribution
              to our understanding of the origin and evolution of the Universe.
