Abstract    :
              This proposal presents a simple technique to controllably and reproducibly
              produce ultrafine fibers of conducting polymers.  Many factors that control
              fiber diameter (like solvent viscosity) using this technique (electrospinning)
              will be investigated so that fibers with average diameters < 100 nm (1 nm = 10
              -9 m) can be prepared.  Electrospinning involves a high voltage source, a metal
              cathode collector and a glass pipette with the polymer solution to be
              electrospun.  Single fibers will be captured on heavily doped silicon oxide
              coated wafers.  The surface morphology will be studied with an optical
              microscope, a scanning electron microscope, a transmission electron microscope
              and an atomic force microscope.  Fiber diameters and possible polymer chain
              alignment will be studied using these methods.  Single fibers will also be
              characterized electrically via dc and ac conductivity measurements as a
              function of temperature.  The PI's will study how the conduction mechanisms in
              these nanofibers differ from that in the bulk and could provide insights into
              the importance of interchain coupling that lead to charge delocalization. 
              Finally, the fibers will be studied to check if the dc conductivity can be
              affected by applying a voltage to the heavily doped silicon.  The purpose is to
              explore the possibility of fabricating nanodevices based on field effects, like
              nanoelectronic p.n junctions, Schottky junctions or field effect transistors
              (FET's).

This project in materials research is directed at helping
              underrepresented students in academia to participate in scientific research
              during their undergraduate years.  The equipment requested in this proposal
              will strengthen the institutional infrastructure and also have a broader impact
              of improving the research facilities on the South-East part of the island.
