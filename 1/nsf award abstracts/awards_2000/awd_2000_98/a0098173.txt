Abstract    :
              An additional chapter on energy conservation is created for the "Home Module of
              Active Physics."  The chapter is based upon the "Rebuild America Program" of
              the U.S. Department of Energy and co-funded by them.  Students assess their
              school building's energy performance and address standards in conservation of
              energy and interactions of energy and matter.  The module follows the Active
              Physics model in content, design and pedagogical format, while supporting the
              Department of Energy's energy education program.  "Rebuild America"
              participates in the dissemination of the module.
