This award will
              devise new methods for solving linear differential equations and for
              integration of algebraic functions, including implementations.  The
              significance is that differential equations are used in physics, engineering,
              mathematics and many other sciences. Several computer algebra softwares have
              solvers that apply various methods to search for closed-form solutions of
              differential equations. This project will lead to new methods, so that more
              equations can be solved. Implementations will be written as well and
              distributed via the web so that researchers who use a computer to solve
              differential equations can easily benefit from the results. Algorithms for
              solving non-linear differential equations will benefit indirectly because such
              algorithms often reduce problems to linear differential equations. The second
              topic in this award consists of improving the performance of the algorithm for
              integration of algebraic functions. This is necessary because the the existing
              method is not efficient enough to handle large inputs.
