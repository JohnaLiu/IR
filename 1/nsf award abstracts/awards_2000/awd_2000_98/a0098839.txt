Abstract    :
              The goals of this project are to produce dense sources of laser-cooled atoms,
              and to understand the collisional and radiative properties of these dense
              atoms.  The dense atom cloud of laser-cooled rubidium atoms will be generated
              in a holographic atom trap (HAT), which is produced by sending a high power
              continuous-wave YAG laser through a holographic phase element, then imagining
              the diffraction pattern onto a cloud of atoms formed inside a dark
              magneto-optical trap.  The effects of multiply scattered light depend crucially
              on the off-resonant absorption spectrum of the atoms, which is predicted to
              have a narrow linewidth, but a large maximum value, making the densest HAT
              clouds optically thick even when the laser light is tuned far off resonance. 
              Measurements of this effect will be made.  The high densities in the HAT will
              also allow for the first time systematic studies of ultracold collision
              frequency shifts outside the context of atomic clocks.
