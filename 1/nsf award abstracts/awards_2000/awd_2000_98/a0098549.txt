Abstract    :
              "The Nature of Metal-Poor Carbon-Enhanced Stars in the
              Galaxy"
AST-0098549

For the first time, there is now an adequate sample of
              stars to use as probes in decoding the initial phases of galactic evolution
              thanks to surveys that were carried out in the 1990s by the PI and colleagues
              for extremely metal poor stars. New surveys covering a volume in space 4 times
              as large are now underway with Hamburg/ESO objective prism material. Among the
              most metal poor stars, carbon enhancements become common and it is already
              clear that the mechanism responsible for this must be very different from that
              which provides carbon excesses in the atmospheres of more metal rich stars. The
              work carried out under this award will be  a spectroscopic follow-up to the
              survey to identify the cause of the enhancement.  Various suggestions have been
              made including contamination of the pre-stellar material by supernovae type II
              or by a type of nuclear burning which is not found in more metal-rich stars.
              Medium-resolution spectroscopy for a large sample of these stars is planned in
              order to identify trends. This will be complemented by high-resolution
              spectroscopy for a representative subsample to provide the constraints on
              plausible nucleosynthesis pathways and evolutionary scenarios.
