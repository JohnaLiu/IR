AST-0098249


This project will image twelve nearby clusters of
              galaxies in neutral hydrogen using the VLA (460 hours have been granted), and
              supplement the data with deep optical multicolor imaging and optical
              spectroscopy. As a byproduct of the neutral hydrogen survey, deep radio
              continuum images will be obtained. The entire volume of the clusters will be
              probed out to two Abell radii.  The work will simultaneously study the low
              density outer regions and the dense cluster cores. The selected clusters are in
              varying degrees of dynamical relaxation, some contain starburst and post
              starburst galaxies, and most have a central X ray source. The goal is to study
              the evolution of galaxies as they travel from the low density outer regions
              into the dense cores of clusters and to assess the dynamical state of the
              clusters.
