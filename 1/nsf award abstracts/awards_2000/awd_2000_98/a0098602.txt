Abstract    :
              After decades of study it is safe to say that the nuclear
interaction, ie. the
              interaction between quarks, is well understood.  However the 
manifestations
              of this interaction in nuclear matter (hadrons) is
only understood in the
              narrowest of settings.  Quark confinement and the 
structure of hadrons remain
              intriguing puzzles.  Our proposal will
study these questions in two broad
              programs:
1) We have identified a few new states that do not fit into
              the
simple pictures of hadron structure.  Other states of this type will
              be
identified and their decay properties will be measured.
2) Electron
              induced reactions will be used to study the proton and
other baryons. 
              Hard-scattering experiments will reveal the quark
structure of these
              states.
