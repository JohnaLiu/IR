Semantic
              unification has been effectively employed in many subfields of logic, computer
              science, artificial intelligence and cognitive science, with its most popular
              use being in resolution, logic programming languages such as Prolog, and the
              type inference mechanism in the programming language ML. Semantic unification
              (associative-commutative unification) played a pivotal role in settling open
              questions in mathematics (e.g. Robbins' conjecture about boolean algebra in
              1996 by McCune using the theorem prover EQP). Recently, semantic unification
              has been found useful also in cryptographic analysis, knowledge representation
              and distributed computing.

This project will be a continuation of research
              on the theory of semantic unification as well as the design, development and
              implementation of semantic unification algorithms. This research will be
              motivated by new applications of semantic unification in cryptographic protocol
              analysis in conjunction with Catherine Meadows' work on the NRL (Naval Research
              Laboratory) Protocol Analyzer, in knowledge representation and description
              logics, induction theorem proving, and process algebra.

The new unification
              algorithms will be first developed and experimented using the Unification
              Workbench, a tool under development at SUNY, Albany, with the eventual goal of
              integrating them into application software, the NRL Protocol Analyzer and a
              rewrite-based induction theorem prover RRL (Rewrite Rule Laboratory) for use in
              the applications discussed above.

This award is one of three in a
              collaborative research team.   The three awards are CCR-0098114 (Deepak Kapur,
              U New Mexico), CCR-0098270 (Christopher Lynch, Clarkson U), and CCR-0098095
              (Paliath Narendran, SUNY Albany).
