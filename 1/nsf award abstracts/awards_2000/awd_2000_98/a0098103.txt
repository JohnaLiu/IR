Abstract    :
              Switching activity estimation is an important aspect of power estimation at
              circuit level. Although simulations can provide accurate estimates of switching
              activity, since simulations are time consuming, recently, probabilistic models
              are being considered that can capture temporal, spatial and sequential
              correlations in a circuit. In this research, we propose to explore a novel
              switching probability estimation strategy using Bayesian networks.

Bayesian
              Networks (BN) can be used to effectively model complex conditional dependencies
              over a set of random variables. The BN inference schemes serve as powerful
              computational mechanisms that transform the circuit into a junction tree of
              cliques to allow for probability propagation by local message passing. The
              proposed approach is accurate and fast.

We intend to investigate (i) power
              estimation of very large combinational circuits (by developing segmentation
              schemes) with input modeling to handle complexly correlated input signals, (ii)
              Bayesian network formalism to handle real delay models with glitches, and (iii)
              switching estimation in sequential circuits using the Bayesian networks
              model.
