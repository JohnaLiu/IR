Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to develop a web-based data system to enhance the
              visibility, networking, and professional success of minorities in the aquatic
              sciences. Specifically the PI will 1) create a centralized database to
              identify, characterize and eventually track minority undergraduate and graduate
              students in aquatic sciences, 2) implement an on-line Student Registry to allow
              students to network with each other and potential employers and graduate
              schools, 3) develop a minority webpage, housed on the American Society of
              Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) website, containing links to student
              resources, 4) establish electronic distribution lists to facilitate
              communication within the minority aquatic science community.  These activities
              are necessary first steps to develop a coherent infrastructure to facilitate
              career development of underrepresented groups and establish networks within and
              beyond the community of minority aquatic science students and professionals.
              This system will have an important impact on the recruitment and retention of
              minority students in the aquatic sciences. The database, student registry,
              website and electronic distribution list will be important tools for a
              centralized tracking of minority programs, for distributing relevant
              information to minority students and scientists, and for recruiting students
              into graduate programs, and eventually, into faculty positions.
