Optical and infrared observations of X-ray sources
              with soft X-ray transients will be carried out. These objects are binary star
              systems, which consist of an accreting compact object and a less massive
              companion star that is the donor. Optical and infrared observations show that
              the compact object is possibly a black hole in many cases although the results
              are controversial. In quiescence, the optical light is dominated by that of the
              companion star and orbital parameters can be measured which indicate that, in
              most cases, the mass of the compact object is above the 3 solar mass upper
              limit for a neutron star. At the times of X-ray outburst, the optical and
              infrared radiation is dominated by that from the accretion flow and from X-ray
              irradiation of the secondary star and surrounding material. Simultaneous
              optical and X-ray observations are needed to describe the geometry and physics
              of these objects which are presently providing some of the strongest evidence
              for the existence of black holes.
