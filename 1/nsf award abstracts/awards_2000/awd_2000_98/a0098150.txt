Abstract    :
              The investigator will study numerical algorithms for solving moderate to large
              scale eigenvalue and generalized eigenvalue problems. There are two lines of
              research. One is to investigate a new kind of parallelizable Hessenberg
              eigen-value algorithm termed  "subdivision-by-deflation".  The
              subdivision-by-deflation algorithm reduces the computational complexity and
              increases the parallelism of Hessenberg eigenvalue problems. This has the
              potential of reducing the computational cost of the Hessenberg eigenvalue
              problem significantly below current levels.

The other line of research
              involves continued development of TTQRE, a variant QR algorithm for solving the
              moderate scale algebraic eigenvalue problem. Although TTQRE has already proved
              itself to be a significant advance over traditional QR algorithms, it has not
              yet reached its full potential. Strategies will be designed that adjust its
              fundamental parameters dynamically during execution. This project supports a
              graduate student who will participate in the project. The student's training
              will benefit from practical computational experience on real parallel computers
              as from the work with theoretical problems.
