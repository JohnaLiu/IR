The project is concerned with the physics of both
              few-degree-of freedom and many-body mesoscopic systems.  The systems include
              quantum dots and compound nuclei formed in nuclear collisions.  These quantum
              systems have some associated underlying, classically chaotic dynamics.  The
              tools provided by semiclassical and statistical theories are not fully
              developed for partially or fully chaotic systems.  The project expects to
              extend the theories, to understand their limitations, and to apply these
              advances to any of a number of physical systems.
