Abstract    :
              " Pulsar Interferometry"
AST- 0098343


Pulsars present one of the most
              clear-cut demonstrations that it is through astronomy and astrophysics that we
              can study the properties of matter existing under conditions quite unattainable
              in our laboratories here on the Earth. Radio pulsars are the most easily
              observed manifestation of the neutron stars which we now recognize as occupying
              a key position in stellar evolution. For example, comparing the radio pulsar
              birthrate with the birthrate of massive stars, the frequency of type II
              supernovae can be constrained, which in turn limits the rate of heavy element
              generation and enrichment from this source. Their impact on fundamental physics
              is likewise enormous, for example in the demonstration of gravitational
              radiation from binary pulsars. Yet, still the basic knowledge of the distances,
              distribution and dynamics of pulsars is in a very primitive state. With radio
              interferometry, precise astrometry is now possible for many pulsars which can
              yield many more parallaxes and proper motions for these objects.  During the
              course of this award the PI and his collaborators plan to use the national
              radio astronomy facilities make these measurements and thus remedy the earlier
              deficiency.
