Abstract    :
              This research involves the study algorithmic problems that arise in
the design
              of next generation networking technology.
Rapid growth of the internet user
              base, coupled with rapid parallel
growth in mobile subscriber numbers, is
              creating powerful pent-up demand
for wireless access to the internet/intranets
              and other data networks.
Communication in wireless networks differs in some
              fundamental 
ways from communication in wired networks. In particular, the
              basic
form of communication in wireless networks is broadcasting,
as opposed
              to point-to-point communications in most wired
networks. This research
              investigates the effect of switching to 
broadcast communication on server
              strategies
in the client-server computing model, one of the most common
              
computing paradigms.



A wide range of real-time applications, such as
              multimedia conferencing, 
computer supported cooperated workspaces, remote
              medical diagnosis etc., 
has become very popular in recent years.  These
              applications have 
dynamically changing bandwidth requirements.  
It is clear
              that controlling and allocating
bandwidth for individual users and web
              browsers is becoming very 
important for bursty traffic flows utilizing highly
              constrained
communications channels.
From the network management's
              perspective, it is advantageous to 
allow the network to dynamically 
change
              the tariff parameters of the charging scheme in response to demand.  
This
              research investigates dynamic renegotiation and
pricing problems that arise in
              the design of networks
that give quality of service guarantees.
