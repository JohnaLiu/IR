Abstract    :
              This three-year Teacher Enhancement project will develop mentoring systems in
              which teacher-leaders and administrators nurture new teachers and encourage
              experienced teachers implementing change.  Teams of middle-level teachers
              (Grades 5-8) from Northwest Missouri will participate in a four-week summer
              institute for each of three years.  Up to 30 mathematics and 30 science
              teachers will participate.  The program combines parallel programs of 130 hours
              of content specific coursework in mathematics or science, plus 275 hours of
              integrated teacher development activities during the summer institutes and
              academic year. Experienced teachers who participate in the renewal portion of
              the project will follow a phased mentoring plan, mentoring one novice teacher
              in Year One, two in Year Two and three in Year Three. The project includes a
              four-day Administrator Academy.
