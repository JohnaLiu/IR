Abstract    :
              Tools and methods from the calculus of variations will be developed and applied
              to a variety of problems in dynamical systems, partial differential equations
              and geometry.  For dynamical systems, the existence of various kinds of
              connecting orbits for Hamiltonian systems will be established.  There are
              related applications to geometry where the existence of minimal heteroclinic,
              homoclinic, and chaotic geodesics for the n-torus and other manifolds will be
              studied.  For partial differential equations, it will be shown how some
              equations that arise in phase transition models admit a large number of
              different kinds of equilibrium states.

The goal of our project is to develop
              new minimization and minimax methods and apply them to areas such as dynamical
              systems, geometry, and partial differential equations.  The applications to
              dynamical systems include establishing the existence of orbits asymptotic to
              simple basic states like equilibrium points and periodic orbits.  Related
              problems occur in geometry where the basic periodic states are periodic
              geodesics and we seek connecting states that are also geodesics.  For partial
              differential equations, a class of phase transition models will be studied
              where we seek to understand what kinds of equilibrium states are possible.
