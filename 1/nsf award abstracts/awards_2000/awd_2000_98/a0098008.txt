Abstract    :
              This award is for the partial support of a series of conferences in the field of
              Partial Differential Equations in Midwestern Universities: University of
              Chicago, Indiana University, University of Wisconsin Madison, Northwestern
              University, Purdue University, Notre Dame, Illinois-Chicago, Illinois-Urbana.
              The conferences will provide the opportunity for communication and
              collaboration among faculty and between senior and junior investigators.
