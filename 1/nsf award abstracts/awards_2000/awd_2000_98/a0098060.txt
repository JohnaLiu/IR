Abstract    :
              Emerging web applications are increasingly likely to use dynamic web
data.
              Traditionally, requests for dynamic data---both time-varying
              and
dynamically-generated---have been handled directly by servers
              and
intermediate proxies haven't been allowed to process requests for
              such
objects (web proxies have been primarily employed to disseminate
              data
that is mostly static).  A pure server-based approach for
              managing
dynamic data is likely to limit the scalability of emerging
              web
applications and increase their vulnerability to server failures.
              To
overcome this drawback, novel proxy-based techniques will be developed
to
              manage and disseminate dynamic web data. The proposed
research will address
              two key issues: (i) data dissemination, which
addresses the issue of
              disseminating time-varying web data using
proxy-based push and pull
              techniques, and (ii) computation
dissemination, which addresses the issue of
              moving computations from
servers to proxies so as to dynamically generate web
              objects at a
proxy. Both techniques have the potential of radically changing
              the
way web proxies are designed and used. These techniques will need
              to
satisfy three key requirements: user-cognizance (i.e., awareness
of user
              and application requirements), intelligence (i.e., the ability
to dynamically
              choose the most efficient set of mechanisms to service
each application), and
              adaptivity (i.e., the ability to react to
changing load characteristics).  The
              proposed techniques will be
evaluated using an eclectic mix of simulation,
              analysis and prototype
implementation.
