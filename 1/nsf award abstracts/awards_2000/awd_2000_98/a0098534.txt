Abstract    :
              This award provides support for purchase an environmental scanning electron
              microscope (ESEM) to be used for examining fully hydrated specimens, a use not
              possible with a conventional scanning electron microscope (SEM). The ESEM is
              fully capable of handling observation of wet, dirty, uncoated, even living
              specimens, as well as observation of dynamic biological processes. The ability
              of the ESEM to maintain the hydration of a sample indefinitely allows the
              examination of biological and other wet samples in their natural state. Initial
              uses for the instrument include studies in botanical and fungal sytematics,
              tracking of neural crest cell migration and other developmental processes,
              including imaginal disk folding, and examination of unprocessed or
              immunolabelled tissue samples. In addition to its use in research, the
              instrument will be used in training of undergraduate and graduate students and
              as part of training activities involving high school teachers.
