Abstract    :
              Florida Atlantic University will host a community planning workshop to discuss
              strategies and procedures  for linking existing coastal ocean observatories
              along the East Coast of the US.  The goal is to coordinate simultaneous
              observation of synoptic scale ocean and atmospheric systems, particularly those
              involving the Gulf Stream and hurricanes, both of which bear major influence on
              East Coast population centers. Linking the observatories makes it possible to
              coordinate standardization of oceanographic and atmospheric measurement tools
              to provide meaningful observations on a synoptic scale.  A coordinated network
              of coastal observatories would also enhance studies on the influence of type,
              orientation and extent of local shelf characteristics on coastal processes. The
              workshop will result in a document that articulates the requirements, methods,
              and potential funding sources for implementing a functional link between the
              observatories. A consortium of East Coast ocean observatories is envisioned
              that will facilitate an integrated approach to ocean observation as well as
              providing a forum for exchange of data and resources.
