Impacts are fundamental processes that have shaped the
              objects in the Solar System.  While they were most important during the
              formation phase of the planets and satellites, they continue to occur today,
              with potentially severe consequences for humanity and other life on the Earth. 
              This project, lead by Dr. Erik Asphaug at the University of California at Santa
              Cruz, focuses on an important aspect of the process: the interaction of an
              impacting body with a planetary (or satellite) atmosphere, as the collision
              takes place. The research team will build on previous work in simulating
              impacts into the Venusian atmosphere to develop a more complete understanding
              of the process.  Earlier work demonstrated that high resolution
              three-dimensional calculations are necessary in order to thoroughly constrain
              the physics of impacts.  The basic goals of this project are to answer the
              questions: Given the parameters of an impact, what are the mass and momentum
              that reach the ground to make a crater? How well do atmospheres stop impacting
              objects?  How does an impactor break up in an atmosphere?  Using the results of
              three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling,  a relatively simple model of
              atmospheric permeability will be  developed, calibrated by "ground truth" data
              from the Earth and Venus.  This will enable answering corollary questions:  to
              determine the age of the surface of Venus, to determine where Earth impactors
              of moderate size deposit their energy, and to predict the state of the surface
              of Titan.
