Abstract    :
              Two low-turbulence inlets (LTIs) for use on the NCAR C-130 aircraft will be
              fabricated and deployed during the ACE-Asia program (Aerosol Characterization
              Experiment-Asia). These inlets permit the slowing of the aerosol sample from
              the true air speed of the airplane, approximately 100 m/s, to a few m/s without
              subjecting the sample to turbulent deposition in the diffuser. This turbulence
              reduction is achieved through boundary layer suction in the diffuser. A suction
              flow control system will be installed in order to maintain the desired sample
              flow as aircraft operating parameters change. The data characterizing the inlet
              performance will be collected and used to calculate the net enhancement factors
              which include the effects of anisokinetic sampling and inertial enhancement of
              large particles in the diffuser.

These new inlets will, for the first time,
              allow airborne sampling of atmospheric aerosols of sub- and supermicron size
              without turbulent losses of larger particles. Even though large particles will
              actually be enhanced by these inlets, it will be possible to quantify their
              concentrations because the enhancement can be calculated. The inlets will be
              made available to NCAR/ATD and the community for use in future programs after
              the completion of ACE-Asia.
