Many changes happen to a star in the late stages of
              its evolution. With this award, the PI seeks to unravel the effects of deep
              interior mixing, mass loss, mass exchange and diffusion on the atmospheric
              abundances of blue horizontal branch stars. It has long been known that the
              blue horizontal branch can take on a very different appearance in globular
              clusters which seem at first sight to be very similar chemically. Strongest
              emphasis in the forthcoming work will be given to investigating the role of
              deep helium mixing and its causes. Work to date shows evidence that it does
              occur in two cases, in NGC6752 blue horizontal branch star which are cool
              enough for their atmospheres not to be influenced by diffusion, and in single
              extended horizontal branch stars which show C,N,O abundances that are
              correlated in the same way as in giant stars and are thus expected to have
              resulted from deep mixing. However, to reinforce this case, blue stars covering
              a much larger range of temperature are to be observed.
