With their almost
              incredibly high densities and rapid rotations, pulsars provide an opportunity
              to test familiar physical theories in order to see if they remain valid at
              extremes.  Radio signals from pulsars have a different character in each
              waveband because the radiation is being emitted over a range of radial
              distances. High-frequency emission appears to originate very close to the
              pulsar surface while low-frequency radiation is generated at a distance of
              about 100 km. By studying the low-frequency radiation we obtain vital data
              about the way the pulsar is interacting with its surroundings. During the
              course of this award, collaborative research will be carried out with a number
              of Russian astronomers in a study of selected pulsars at low frequency. The
              Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory is one of the few low-frequency
              facilities currently available. Support is requested for visits of US
              astronomers to Russia and of Russian astronomers to the US as well as for some
              equipment upgrades. Two of the American Co-PIs have already had lengthy
              experience in this collaboration. The observations are time-critical because
              man-made radio interference at these low frequencies is increasing rapidly and
              may become very difficult to make in the near future.
