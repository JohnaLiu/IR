The invasion of native communities by introduced
              organisms is causing tremendous economic damage to our natural ecosystems. 
              Biological control programs often fail, which places additional burdens on the
              environment because invasives must then be controlled with chemical pesticides
              and herbicides. The foundation of this study is one of the most successful weed
              biological control programs in the US.  It is focused on St. John's Wort
              (Hypericum perforatum), an important invasive plant that has been successfully
              controlled using introduced herbivores.  The project can help us to understand
              the evolution of herbivore resistance, and loss of resistance, and can reveal
              the coevolutionary dynamics between plants and their insect biocontrol agents. 
              The project has strong relevance for basic ecology as well as numerous economic
              applications in the fields of conservation biology and agriculture.  The
              experiments can determine if plants can rapidly lose, then accrue, resistance
              in the absence and presence of biocontrol agents, and will also demonstrate if
              plant resistance to one herbivore provides resistance to multiple herbivores. 
              Currently there are few empirical studies on these questions.
