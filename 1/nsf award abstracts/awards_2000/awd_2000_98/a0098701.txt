The Galactic magnetic field is a major component of the
              interstellar medium.  Although the origin of the field remains a mystery, many
              of the processes which maintain the field in its current state have now been
              identified.  One of the most important of these processes is diffusive
              transport, which changes the distribution of magnetic flux to mass despite the
              high conductivity of interstellar gas.  Dr. Ellen Zweibel, at the University of
              Colorado, will pursue two research projects directed at understanding diffusive
              transport of the interstellar magnetic field.  The first project concerns the
              field strengths in molecular clouds, which impact molecular cloud dynamics and
              star formation.  The second project concerns the escape of magnetic flux from
              the Galactic disk, its implications for the vertical structure of the Galactic
              magnetic field, and its impact on the Galactic dynamo.  These projects are
              related through their joint dependence on ambipolar drift and turbulence.
