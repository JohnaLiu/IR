Abstract    :
              The scientific aim of this collaborative project is to carry out precise
              measurements of certain transition energies between the n=2 levels on
              intermediate Z hydrogen-like and helium-like ions.  The measurements will test
              quantum electrodynamic calculations, particularly of higher-order binding
              corrections, in one- and two-electron systems.  The work has relevance to the
              interpretation of precision spectroscopy of hydrogen and helium and hence to
              obtaining values for the Rydberg constant and the fine structure constant.  
              The method to be used involves laser spectroscopy of fast, foil-stripped ion
              beams from the Florida State Van de Graaff accelerator.  The work will involve
              graduate and undergraduate students from Florida State and Florida A&M
              Universities.
