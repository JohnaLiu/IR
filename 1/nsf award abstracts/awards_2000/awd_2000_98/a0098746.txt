Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for R&D work on BTeV, a recently approved program
              at Fermilab.  The collaborating university groups need R&D support to ensure
              that the BTeV detector is running at the same time as the European competition,
              LHCb at the CERN laboratory.  

BTeV is a program designed to challenge the
              Standard Model (SM) explanation of CP violation, mixing and rare decays in the
              b-quark and the c-quark systems.  Exploiting the large numbers of b-quarks and
              c-quarks produced at the Tevatron collider requires a highly specialized
              detector, unconstrained by a central geometry that is prescribed to study
              high-transverse-momentum physics, and not limited by the relatively low
              production rate of b-quarks and c-quarks in electron-positron colliders.  BTeV
              excels in several crucial areas including triggering on decays with purely
              hadronic final states, charged particle identification, electromagnetic
              calorimetry, and proper time resolution.

Key features of BTeV include: (1) a
              dipole located at the IR, which gives BTeV an effective "two arm" acceptance,
              (2) a precision vertex detector based on planar pixel arrays, (3) a detached
              vertex trigger at level 1 that makes BTeV efficient for most final states,
              including purely hadronic modes, (4) excellent charged particle identification
              using a Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detector, (5) a high quality lead-tungstate
              electromagnetic calorimeter capable of reconstructing final states with single
              photons, p0's, h's, or h''s and of identifying electrons, (6) precision
              tracking using straw tubes and silicon microstrip detectors, which provide
              excellent momentum and mass resolution, (7) excellent identification of muons
              using a dedicated detector with the ability to supply a dimuon trigger, and (8)
              a very high speed and high throughput data acquisition system which eliminates
              the need to tune the experiment to specific final states.
