Abstract    :
              "Studies in Relativistic Physics and Astrophysics"

General relativity is the
              theoretical foundation of current work on the physics on neutron stars and
              black holes, on the generation of gravitational waves, and in a broad sense on
              modern cosmology in general. However, the theory still remains largely
              untested, except in the weak-field, low-velocity regime. The the research being
              done under this award addresses several fundamental areas in relativistic
              physics and astrophysics that are currently ripe for progress. Specific
              research topics include the physics of accretion onto relativistic objects,
              possible ways to detect general relativistic effects and constraints on the
              equation of state and dynamical properties of dense matter in neutron stars. 
              In addition to the theoretical analyses, attention will be given to the
              planning and analysing of observations designed to probe the properties of
              dense matter and strong gravitational fields. In this effort, the research
              program can take full advantage of the new information on black holes and
              neutron stars that is now being provided by space-based observations.
