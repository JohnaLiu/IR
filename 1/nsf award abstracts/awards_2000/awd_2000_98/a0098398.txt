Abstract    :
              This RUI project focuses on the generation of amplitude-squeezed states of light
              from vertical-cavity, surface-emitting lasers (VCELs), and, in particular, on
              what conditions produce the lowest amount of noise from a pulsed VCSEL and why
              this is the case.  To this end the noise behavior of the VCSEL pulses will be
              thoroughly characterized.  The laser will be operated under differing drive and
              feedback conditions, and the time evolution of the noise behavior will be
              measured.  Coupling between amplitude and phase noise in the laser will be
              measured, and the technique of amplitude-phase decoupling will be used to
              reduce the laser noise.
