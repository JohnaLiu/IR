Irregular galaxies are the most common types of galaxy
              in the Universe and of all the facets of their evolution, none is more
              important than the influence of the most massive stars.  Through exceptionally
              strong winds and subsequent explosions as supernovae, massive stars deposit
              tremendous amounts of energy into their environments, triggering the formation
              of new generations of stars, dispersing newly formed chemical elements, and
              driving the evolution of the host galaxy.  This project focuses on this dynamic
              and often violent relationship between massive stars and their environments.
              Using a combination of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large
              Array and the new fiber-optic technology on the WIYN
              (Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale-National Observatories) optical telescope, the
              participants will measure the impact of stars on their environment and measure
              the ability of an individual galaxy to mitigate the effects of these massive
              stars.  This systematic investigation will unravel the mysteries of how
              irregular galaxies have evolved over time, and how they continue to evolve
              today.
