Abstract    :
              The awardee will support the coordination of the NSF Geospace Environment
              Modeling (GEM) workshops.  The GEM workshops are comprised of a week-long
              workshop each summer and a half-day mini-workshop in conjunction with each Fall
              American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting.  The funds will support all facets of
              the workshop including facility planning, meeting logistics, room and
              audio-visual rental, student and scientist travel support, and associated
              administrative support.  The goals of the workshops are to identify and work
              toward solutions of outstanding problems in several focused areas of research
              that will contribute to the ultimate development of a magnetospheric global
              circulation model.  The goal of the workshop coordination is to provide
              organized forums to foster the community-wide discussions and research needed
              to achieve the GEM initiative goals.
