Abstract    :
              The fundamental particles and interactions in nature are currently
described by
              the Standard Model, with the sector of strong
interactions described by
              Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).  The quark
mass eigenstates of QCD are related
              to the physical weak eigenstates
of the Standard Model through the
              Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)
matrix.  A requirement of this matrix is that
              the sum of the squares
of the three elements across each row or each column be
              unity. 
Currently, the sum for the first row falls below unity by 2 to
              2-1/2
standard deviations.  The possible deficiency opens up the
possibility
              for new physics, such as additional quark families or
super-symmetry  models. 
              One of these matrix elements can be
determined by a measurement of the decay
              rate of the K meson into a
pion, a positron, and a neutrino, known as Ke3. 
              Experiment E927 at
Brookhaven National Laboratory will use the Crystal Ball
              
spectrometer to make a new, high-precision measurement of the Ke3
decay
              rate.  This improvement by about a factor of 3 over the
current value, along
              with new neutron decay experiments, will permit
a critical test of CKM
              unitarity.  Experiment E927 will also provide
data concerning weak
              interactions in hadrons, and may help with the
interpretation of recent
              related data on the production of neutron
mesons from nucleons and nuclei.
