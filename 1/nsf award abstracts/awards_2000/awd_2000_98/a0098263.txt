Abstract    :
              This project proposes to build a Multi-View Storage System, MVSS.  Similar to a
              Multi-View Database System, MVSS allows multiple views of the same file on the
              physical disk to be generated dynamically.
To support multiple views, devices
              will be "multiported".  Different views of a file can be customized to provide
              different types of service at a multiported device.  MVSS separates the
              deployment of services from file system implementations and thus allows
              services to be performed at various levels of the
storage system. Multiple
              views of the file are provided to the user through file system
              namespace.
Through these views, MVSS provides a flexible and extensible way
              for supporting a wide range of services including device-level
              enhancements.

In this project, we will build an experimental testbed
              incorporating these ideas and plan to evaluate them through real applications.
              Database Select operations, MPEG filtering for QOS, sorting and a
number of
              other applications will be used to drive the prototype system.
