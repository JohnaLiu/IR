This group will study a broad range of problems involving
              strongly interacting systems using either Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the
              underlying field theory of the strong interaction, or its connection to
              effective theories of the strong interaction at low energies.  Calculations of
              meson and glueball masses will be made directly as a QCD bound state problem
              using light-front renormalization-group techniques.  Effective field theory
              techniques will be used to connect QCD with the nuclear many-body problem and
              with relativistic hadronic description of nuclear reactions.
