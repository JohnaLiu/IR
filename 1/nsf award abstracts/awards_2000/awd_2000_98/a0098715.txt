Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for Professor Vladimir Braginsky and his group at
              the Moscow State University (MSU) in Moscow, Russia.  Braginsky and his group
              are members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) and they propose to
              continue research on topics of great interest to the LIGO project to which the
              group has made outstanding contributions over the years.   While most of the
              research will be carried out at MSU, Braginsky and his colleagues will be in
              frequent close contact with LIGO Laboratory and LSC members as the
              collaboration works to develop new tools and techniques that will be used in
              Advanced LIGO detectors.  The MSU group will focus their research on new
              materials and techniques that will reduce the noise level that limits the
              sensitivity of LIGO in its quest to detect gravitational waves.   In addition,
              they will study ideas for breaking through the quantum limit on measurement
              precision that is expected to be reached by Advanced LIGO.  This limit was
              pointed out by Braginsky a number of years ago, and interest in trying to avoid
              this limit is now being pursued in a number of laboratories.  Schemes for
              accomplishing this (called "Quantum-Non-Demolition" - a term invented by
              Braginsky) will be studied by the MSU group, the acknowledged world leaders in
              this topic.
