Abstract    :
                Our research goal is to improve quality level of CMOS ICs without performing
              the high-cost burn-in process. High-voltage screening schemes have been
              successfully developed and implemented to eliminate early-life failures due to
              oxide defects in digital CMOS circuits. However, the success is not extended to
              its analog counterparts due to their working conditions and circuit topological
              structures. This project proposes to develop efficient yet effective
              high-voltage stress test process for analog circuits. The research objective is
              to develop the framework of an automatic stress test system for
              analog/mixed-signal circuits, where the system integrate three major
              components: stressability analysis, stressability design methodologies, and
              stress test process. The component of stressability design methodologies
              include a stress vector generation
process and a stressability enhancement
              process. The stress test process generates the test programs with the defined
              stress conditions for the circuits under test.
 
  The success of this
              development will enable the analog circuit to be stressed properly using
              high-voltage screening to eliminate early-life failures due to oxide defects
              and to enhance reliability and quality of CMOS
ICs without performing
              high-cost burn-in screening.
