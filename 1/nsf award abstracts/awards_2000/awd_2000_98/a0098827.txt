Abstract    :
              Funding is being provided for the International Symposium on Electron-Molecule
              Collisions and Swarms, to be held in Lincoln, Nebraska July 14-16, 2001, as a
              satellite to the ICPEAC. This will permit the attendance of students, junior
              faculty and participants from less favored regions.  Since this Symposium will
              represent the major world gathering of workers in this field, it will represent
              an important educational opportunity for these participants.
