Active galactic nuclei, (AGN) are some of
              the most dramatic components of the Universe---they emit prodigious amounts of
              power (as much as several orders of magnitude more than a bright galaxy),
              radiate it over a tremendous swath of the electromagnetic spectrum (from the
              radio region to hard X-rays), and sometimes generate bulk relativistic flows
              which emerge as jets of particles stretching for millions of light years from
              their centers. This project covers several different projects. One set of
              projects is directed at determining the energy source in different types of
              AGN. They include mid-infrared observations of radio  galaxies, to locate
              hidden AGN which can be seen by their waste heat; photometry in the  millimeter
              spectral regions, to see if optically dull radio galaxies have no hidden
              optical AGN; and mapping and spectroscopy in the mm waveband, to identify
              gravitational lensed quasars. The second set of projects involves adaptive
              optics observations of nearby and high-redshift AGN, including an isotropically
              selected Seyfert sample, and high redshift quasars and radio galaxies for host
              information.
Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for
              Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).
