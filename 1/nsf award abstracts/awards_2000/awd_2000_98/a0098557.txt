The natural laboratory of the early universe
              provided more extreme environments for a much longer time than we can ever come
              close to attaining in artificial laboratories.  In this project,
Theoretical
              studies will be performed to connect predicted astrophysical relics of the
              early universe with observational data.  One form of relic is the Dark Matter
              that provides most of the attractive gravity binding galaxies together. In one
              part of the project, mathematical modeling will show how observations of the
              structure of galaxies can reveal the properties of the exotic Dark Matter
              particles they are made of, and their history of formation and clustering since
              the early Big Bang. In another part of the project, cosmological sources of
              gravitational waves will be studied. These vibrations in the fabric of
              space-time will probably be detected for the first time during the next decade.
              They are much more penetrating than light or any other kind of energy; every
              violent event that has ever happened in the history of the universe has left
              behind a faint reverberation that still echoes today.  We will calculate the
              character of detectable gravitational wave signals that might have been
              produced during the formation of our three-dimensional space out of the true
              fundamental space, which is now thought to have many more dimensions. The aim
              is to learn about the fundamental properties of how space and energy are put
              together.  Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for
              Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).
