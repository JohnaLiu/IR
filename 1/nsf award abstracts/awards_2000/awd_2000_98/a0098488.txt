Abstract    :
              The bulk of this research program will concern the "causal set
hypothesis",
              which states that the deep structure of spacetime is that
of an extended
              "family tree", known technically as a "partial order".
Prof. Sorkin will
              develop this approach further by advancing the
underlying theory, while at the
              same time applying it to questions like
that of the cosmological constant,
              which recently has been shown to
contribute the greater part of the effective
              energy density of the
universe.  The remainder of the research will continue
              the study of
closely related questions about the fine structure of black
              hole
horizons and questions concerning what happens when the topology
              of
spacetime changes or deviates from flatness on small scales.
	All these
              questions are important as part of the larger problem
of quantum gravity,
              which is how physicists refer to the task of
unifying the two main pillars of
              physical theory in its current
state of development: Quantum Theory and
              General Relativity.  A
theory of quantum gravity is generally expected to tell
              us about
the deep structure of spacetime on the smallest length scales
and,
              at the same time, to help answer questions about how the
cosmos came to be as
              it is on the largest length scales.
