Abstract    :
              This project, a collaboration between NCISE and the Connecticut State Department
              of Education will investigate the research potential of the portfolios required
              of all Connecticut second-year mathematics and science teachers and compare
              multiple avenues of new research that address issues of national significance
              for improvement of teacher preparation and induction. 

The study poses the
              following questions:

1. What mathematics or science content do
              well-qualified and supported beginning teachers know, and what is the quality
              of their mathematics and science instruction?
2. How does the teaching quality
              of second-year teachers vary with the extent and nature of district- and
              school-level support provided during their first year?
3. What gains do
              teachers who fail the portfolio submission upon resubmission make?
4. What
              professional development benefits accrue to teachers who score the
              portfolios?
5. What aspects of Connecticut's program are transferable and
              under what conditions?
6. How can preservice faculty use the portfolios to
              improve their courses?
