This one-year award, which supports U.S.-Italy cooperative
              research on the development of new methodology in the area of optimal
              approximate control theory, involves Victoria Chen of the Georgia Institute of
              Technology and Ricardo Zoppoli, University of Genoa, Italy.  The objective of
              their research is to expand the role of statistics in operations
              research.

The U. S. principal investigator brings to this collaboration her
              expertise in the application of statistical learning to stochastic
              optimization.  This work is complemented by the Italian investigator's
              experience in control theory problems that violate the classical LQG (linear
              dynamic systems, quadratic cost functions, and Gaussian random variables).  The
              results of this research are expected to reduce the computational effort
              required to solve problems in approximate optimal control theory.
