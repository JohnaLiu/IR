Abstract    :
              The overall objective of this research is to further the understanding of a set
              of basic atomic and ionic processes significant to plasma science.  Three
              topics will be pursued in detail.  1) The electrical conductivity of dense,
              cool plasmas will be measured in order to benchmark transport theory of
              strongly coupled plasmas.  2) Emission and absorption spectra involving low
              excitation states of He-, Li-, and Be-like ions in well-diagnosed
              laser-produced plasmas will be measured and the results compared with theory
              and simulations to test current models.  3) Measurements of x-ray spectral
              satellite lines will be carried out in order to test theories that the
              appearance of these lines is due to charge transfer collisions in dense
              plasmas.
