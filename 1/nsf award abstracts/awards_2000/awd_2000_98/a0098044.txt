Abstract    :
              The short term goal of this project is to explore and exploit optical forces on
              atoms, particularly metastable helium atoms, that derive from improved control
              of the momentum exchange between the atoms and the light field.  This improved
              control arises from carefully orchestrated, rapid, coherent sequences of
              absorptions followed by stimulated emissions using non-chromatic light.   The
              longer term plans are for applications of the extremely cold and dense sample
              of helium that can be produced with these large forces.  High on the list of
              possibilities under consideration is exploitation of the high internal energy
              for nanofabrication by lithography using self-assembling monolayers to pattern
              a resist.
