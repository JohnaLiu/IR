Abstract    :
              During the summers, the Aspen Center for Physics will serve as a
meeting ground
              where theoretical physicists and astrophysicists can gather
to exchange ideas
              in such areas as elementary particle physics,
condensed matter physics, and
              astrophysics. This exchange of ideas is
crucial if there is to be vigorous
              progress in these fields, and the Aspen
Center is exceptionally effective in
              fostering this exchange.

	During the winters, the Aspen Center will act as
              the host for
winter conferences in which the latest developments in elementary
              particle
physics, condensed matter physics, and astrophysics will be reported
              and
discussed.

	Support for the Aspen Center for Physics will be provided
              through
the NSF Divisions of Astronomical Sciences, Materials Research,
              and
Physics.
