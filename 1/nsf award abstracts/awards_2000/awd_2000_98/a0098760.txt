Theoretical support offering interpretations of the physics in
              heavy-ion experiments carried out at the relativistic heavy ion collider at
              Brookhaven National Laboratory and planned at the LHC at CERN is crucial to the
              experimental study of the possible formation of a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). 
              Conventional mechanisms need to be studied and understood fully before claiming
              new physics such as QGP.  This proposal concerns the physics of particle
              production and collective nuclear effects in these nuclear collisions.
              Electromagnetic probes of strongly interacting particles produced within the
              nuclear medium are the tools of choice of the Principal Investigator.  It is
              hoped that this work will enable one to separate the proposed QGP signals from
              the all the other complicated hadronic phenomena that occur in the hot and
              dense environment created in these collisions.
