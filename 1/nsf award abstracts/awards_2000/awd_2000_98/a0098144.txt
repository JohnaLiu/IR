Baragiola

Dr. Raul Baragiola, at the University of Virginia,
              will carry out laboratory research to address key questions about the surfaces
              of icy satellites in the outer solar system and their interaction with
              energetic radiation and atmospheric species.  Dr. Baragiola plans to measure
              the interaction of atomic oxygen with water and carbonaceous minerals. 
              Experiments will be set up to learn how the results for protons scale for
              highly ionizing, heavier ions, which constitute the predominant source of
              magnetospheric sputtering in the outer solar system.  The ability to control
              the morphology of amorphous ice will be followed by the study of how
              microstructure affects the adsorption/absorption of atmospheric gases and
              optical reflectance.  The research has direct implications for comets, ring
              particles, and interstellar grains.  The results also have applications to
              remote sensing of ices on Earth, the physics and chemistry of mesospheric ice
              in the Earth's upper atmosphere, processing of materials by ion and photons,
              materials science of amorphous materials, radiation effects in biological
              tissue and exobiology.
