Abstract    :
              In this project fundamental problems in quantum chaos and electromagnetic wave
              chaos will be addressed using microwave experiments that study wave mechanics
              in model billiard geometries in which the classical particle dynamics is
              chaotic.  The experimental results will be analyzed to obtain insights into the
              correspondence between classical and quantum properties.  The correspondence
              between quantum and classical correlations, and the quantum coherent
              corrections, all of which signify non-universal behavior, will be a major theme
              of the project.
