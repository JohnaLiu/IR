This is a collaborative research project involving Dr.
              Andrew McWilliam, Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and
              Dr. R. Michael Rich, University of California at Los Angeles.  These
              researchers will undertake a large survey of detailed chemical abundances in
              giant stars along the minor axis of the bulge of the Milky Way Galaxy, at
              distances ranging from 40 to 1000 parsec from the nucleus of the Galaxy.  The
              study will provide detailed knowledge of the chemical composition and
              metallicity function of the Galactic bulge, which is presently well known only
              for the local disk and halo of the Galaxy.  Since extant chemical evolution
              models are based on these local components, the bulge provides a very different
              environment with which to test the widely accepted paradigm of chemical
              evolution.  The survey will use the newly commissioned 6.5-meter Magellan
              telescope in Chile and the Keck telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.
