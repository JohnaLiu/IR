Abstract    :
              The Arizona State University Meson Physics group will pursue a pair
of
              approaches to provide insight into fundamental descriptions of
the
              constituents of atomic nuclei by [1] obtaining data on the
electro- and
              photoproduction of eta meson, and [2] by studying weak
and electromagnetic
              decays of pions, to provide stringent tests of
CKM unitarity, electromagnetic
              corrections to the Standard Model,
the limits of quark lepton universality,
              and the chiral anomaly. The
eta meson production experiments will be conducted
              with the CLAS
Collaboration at Jefferson Lab using the Hall B photon tagger
              and
the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS). Pion beta decay will
be
              studied at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland
with the
              PiBeta Collaboration. The electromagnetic decay of the pion
will be studied
              with a precision measurement of the neutral pion
lifetime at Jefferson Lab
              with the PRIMEX collaboration. Data
analyses will be conducted at ASU and at
              Jefferson Lab.

All experiments are high priority activities in contemporary
              nuclear
physics and provide tests of fundamental symmetries.
              Development,
construction, and utilization of major state-of-the-art equipment
              is
integral to this activity. Education of students is an important
component
              of this proposal.
