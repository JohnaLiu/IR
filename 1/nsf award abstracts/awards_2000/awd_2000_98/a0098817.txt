Abstract    :
              The major emphasis of this research is new and continuing experimental tests of
              quantum electrodynamics (QED) and relativistic bound-state formalism in the
              positron-electron system positronium (Ps).  Ps is an attractive atom for such
              tests because it is purely leptonic and because the electron and the positron
              are antiparticles, and thus the unique effects of annihilation on the real and
              imaginary energy levels of Ps can be tested to high precision.  In the past few
              years, the precision of QED theory has overtaken that of experiment, and the
              challenge now is to improve the experimental precision correspondingly and to
              confront theory.   A new measurement of the triplet decay rate will achieve 200
              ppm uncertainty early in 2001; the present experiment will push this to a level
              of 60 ppm.
