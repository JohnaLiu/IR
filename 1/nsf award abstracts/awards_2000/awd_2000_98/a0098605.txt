	The program is designed to stimulate and encourage the
              scientific development of young researchers in the areas of probability and
              stochastic processes. The participants will spend the summer together in
              Madison, Wisconsin in day-to-day interaction with senior researchers from the
              University of Wisconsin as well as with senior visitors. Participants will
              benefit from access to the major research library and other research facilities
              at the University, opportunities to establish continuing contacts and
              collaboration with other participants in the program, and advice and support in
              developing long term research programs.
	The Summer 2001 program will focus on
              the study of probabilities of both large and small deviations in random
              systems, in 2002 the program will be devoted to shapes, waves, and interfaces
              generated by spatial interactions, and in 2003 the focus will involve spatial
              processes and stochastic geometry. Each of these programs will begin with
              survey lectures in the given areas of focus by experts from the U.S. and
              abroad. Three such lecture series are typically planned to begin each program,
              with each series consisting of five to eight hours of material. After the
              opening lectures there are follow up lectures on related material, and
              additional talks by participants, visitors, and local experts. In addition to
              the lectures, the intern program seeks to generate interactions between senior
              faculty and participants, as well as those between the participants themselves.
              These interactions can take the form of study groups, small group discussions,
              and sometimes one on one discussions. The program lasts about eight weeks.
