The  nuclei of many galaxies harbor highly energetic
              processes, which  are thought to be powered ultimately by strong gravitational
              fields in the regions surrounding supermassive black holes.  In special 
              circumstances, gas orbiting or falling into the nuclear regions of galaxies can
              produce a luminous maser (a microwave laser) which is observed as a strong
              radio spectral line emanating from a galactic nucleus.  Such "megamasers" ---
              so called because they are roughly 
a million times more luminous than typical
              masers associated with young stars found in the Milky Way  --- are produced by
              excited H2O or OH molecules.  OH megamasers in particular are found
only in
              the nuclei of merging galaxies and are luminous enough to be observable at
              cosmological distances.  

The study proposed here aims to characterize and
              understand the relationship between merging galaxies and the production of OH
              megamasers with the ultimate goal of using OH megamasers to trace the merging
              history of galaxies as a function of cosmic time.  The number evolution of
              galaxies with time is not yet known, although it is likely to be an important
              element  in the galaxy evolution process.  This study will (1) establish the
              space density of OH megamasers from a broad OH spectral line survey of merging
              galaxies at the Arecibo Observatory, (2) determine the spatial scale of OH
              masing in these systems from a study of line intensity variability, (3)
              characterize the type of host most favorable to producing an OH megamaser from
              optical spectroscopy at Palomar Observatory, and (4) characterize the potential
              use of OH megamasers as indicators of merging galaxies at high redshift.
