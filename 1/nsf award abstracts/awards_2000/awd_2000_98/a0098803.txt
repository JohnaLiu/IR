Abstract    :
              As part of the implementation of an Agreement for Scientific and Technological
              Cooperation Between the European Community and the Government of the United
              States of America, the National Science Foundation has entered into an
              implementing arrangement with a European Union "key action" that supports
              materials research. Details about this agreement may be found at
              http://www.cordis.lu/fp5 and in the NSF Dear Colleague Letter, NSF-0018
              (revised), Proposals for Cooperative Activities in Materials Sciences between
              the National Science Foundation and the European Commission,
              http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2000/nsf0018/nsf0018.htm. The present project, "NSF-EC
              Activity: Current Induced Magnetic Switching in Sub-micron Sized Multilayers",
              is a joint undertaking between the PI's group at Michigan State University and
              Prof. A. Fert's group at ORSAY in France.  The research concerns the current
              induced magnetic switching in sub-micron sized multilayers. This topic is of
              great importance both on account of its intrinsic interest on the physics of
              giant magneto resistance, as well as for its technological relevance.  The
              principal goal of this grant award is to permit the PIs and/or their students
              to travel to France to plan and carry out joint experiments.  This scientific
              interchange serves to enhance the synergistic link between two major groups and
              the development of a globally oriented workforce, which helps maintain
              America's leadership position in the science and technology of magnetic
              materials.
