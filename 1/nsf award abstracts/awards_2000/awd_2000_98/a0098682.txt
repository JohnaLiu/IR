Abstract    :
               The project addresses the issues of vision tracking, in particular the
              consecutive use of hypotheses generated by tracking methods to yield better
              results in tracking. The proposed approach is likely to be expendable to
              various tasks, such as finding clothed people in images. Overall the approach
              promises a powerful technique for building an accurate self-initializing
              tracker.
