Majeed

Dr. Tariq Majeed, at the Southwest Research Institute,
              will analyze the newly released electron density data from Jupiter taken by the
              Galileo spacecraft.  Dr. Majeed will modify existing models to allow more
              realistic calculations of the density distribution of each of  the 14
              vibrationally excited levels of molecular hydrogen in their ground electronic
              state.  The model will use the neutral temperature structure and composition
              measurements from the Galileo ASI probe.  Dr. Majeed will also study the
              effects of the vertical drift of plasma, induced either by electric fields or
              neutral winds, on the distribution of the measured ionospheric electron
              densities.  Such dynamic effects can influence the ionospheric structure by
              moving the location of the electron density peak. The modified version of the
              model will be used to interpret the newly released Galileo data.
