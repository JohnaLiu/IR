Abstract    :
              The focus of this research project is on the electronic, thermal, and surface
              properties of alkali nanoclusters ranging in size from 10 to 10,000 atoms.  The
              experiments will be carried out on free clusters in beams, generated in vapor
              expansion sources, and detected by mass spectrometers.  In this way,
              nanoclusters can be studied as a function of precisely known size and without
              distortions caused by substrate effects.   The project aims to understand:  (1)
              the fate of slow electrons attracted and captured by the cluster polarization
              potential; (2) the temperature dependence of the electric dipole polarizability
              of clusters; and (3) the origin of highly efficient charge transfer in
              collisions of clusters with surfaces.  All these phenomena are related to the
              dynamics of mobile cluster electrons.  They touch upon the fundamental physics
              of finite many-body systems and surfaces, such as carrier scattering and
              electron-vibrational coupling in nanoscale systems, the interplay between
              structural and electronic properties, thermal expansion, and the melting
              transition.
