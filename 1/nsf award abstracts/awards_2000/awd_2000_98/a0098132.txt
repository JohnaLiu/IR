In a
              set of preliminary experiments, the PI was able to blend low concentration
              nanoscale particles in linear chain polymer of the same species.  Remarkably,
              the rheology of this blended material is altered in such a way that its
              viscosity and modulus are reduced.  This  effect will have potential favorable
              impact on procession of polymers.  The aim of the present proposal is to
              determine the mechanism by which the viscosity and the modulus are reduced by a
              set of planned experiments.
