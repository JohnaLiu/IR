Interstellar magnetic fields play a central role in a
              variety of important processes in galaxies, notably in star formation and the
              evolution of molecular clouds.  Yet the origin of galactic magnetic fields is
              poorly understood.  This project is conducting numerical studies of the origin
              and evolution of magnetic fields in galaxies in order to determine how their
              strength and geometry change over time in response to the combined effects of
              small-scale disturbances such as supernovae and star formation and large-scale
              disturbances such as galactic-scale accretion and differential rotation.  The
              project's goals include understanding why the field in our Galaxy undergoes a
              transition from a relatively weak azimuthal field in the Galactic disk to a
              strong, dipole field at the Galactic center. The detailed nature of the
              transition zone will be explored, with particular focus on the stability of the
              transition and the interplay between the magnetic field and individual clouds.
              Funding for this project was provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic
              Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).
