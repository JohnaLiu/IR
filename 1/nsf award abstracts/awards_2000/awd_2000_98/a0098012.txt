Abstract    :
              	This research involves media-on-demand systems.  A media-on-demand system is a
              distributed network system where servers respond to demands by clients to
              receive various types of media such as video, audio, or large files.  Such
              systems may be implemented within an organization like a hotel or a university,
              or over the Internet.  Currently, Internet media-on-demand systems use unicast,
              meaning that each client receives its own transmission.  This method does not
              scale up well for popular media where hundreds of thousands of requests might
              be received in a short time.  Thus today, for example, hotels providing
              movies-on-demand typically make customers wait up to an hour for starting
              times.  

	In this research, the principal investigator studies algorithms
              for systems where multicast or broadcast is available and buffer storage is
              adequate.  Tradeoffs among server bandwidth, startup delay, client receive
              bandwidth and client buffer size are studied.   In particular, new algorithms
              and mathematical analyses are developed to explore these tradeoffs.  The main
              goal of the research is to understand how to achieve the highest Quality of
              Service with as few resources as possible.
