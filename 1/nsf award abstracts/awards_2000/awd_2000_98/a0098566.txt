Elliptical galaxies contain a large fraction of the stars
              and dark matter in the local universe, yet their formation mechanisms are still
              largely unknown. Understanding the formation and evolution of elliptical
              galaxies is essential for understanding galaxy formation, and, ultimately, the
              star formation history of the universe. In addition, ellipticals are often
              found to be the hosts of powerful active galactic nuclei (AGN) and
              understanding their evolution may also shed some light on the AGN phenomenon.
              Various competing scenarios of elliptical formation have been studied over the
              past decade. These include: 1) multiple bursts of early star formation, 2)
              merging of gas-rich spiral galaxies, and  3) prolonged accretion and tidal
              stripping of gas-poor galaxies. 

This project involves a detailed study of
              NGC 5128 (Centaurus A), the nearest giant elliptical galaxy. Cen A has
              undergone a recent merger with a gas-rich system, and is one of the
              prototypical classes of radio galaxies. This makes it an excellent laboratory
              in which to study both the fossil record of old stars in the halos of
              ellipticals, and the transitional states that result from mergers and nuclear
              activity. The present work will cover Cen A's halo as far out as a radius of
              100 kpc. It will use broadband UBVRI and [O III] imaging and multifiber
              spectroscopy to constrain the origins of the stellar populations in Cen A.  In
              particular it seeks to:
1. determine the origin of the faint halo light, i.e.
              the extended stellar disk, shells, and other possible merger remnants like
              accreted dwarf galaxies.
2. determine the spatial distribution, metallicity
              distribution, and kinematics of the globular cluster system. 
3. determine the
              quantity, spatial extent, and timescale of AGN-induced star formation in the
              halo. 
4. measure the extent of the elliptical galaxy halo, and quantify the
              total mass of its luminous and dark matter out to 100 kpc.
