The central region of our galaxy is heavily
              obscured and, until the development of infrared instrumentation, was
              inaccessible to spectroscopic observation. But it is here that we expect to see
              the long-term effects of vigorous star formation on the chemical abundances of
              our galaxy. Thus the availability of infrared spectrographs has opened a new
              window of opportunity for observing stars to investigate abundance trends where
              they are likely to be the most conspicuous. The work during this two year award
              will be directed towards the changing abundances of oxygen and carbon in the
              atmospheres of cool stars in the halo and in the galactic center region. A
              further advantage of working in the infrared comes from the relative cleanness
              of the spectrum and an atmospheric opacity which is better understood. The
              project will use high resolution echelle spectrographs at Cerro Tololo
              Inter-American Observatory and at the Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawaii.
              Plans are also being made to observe with the two Gemini telescopes.
