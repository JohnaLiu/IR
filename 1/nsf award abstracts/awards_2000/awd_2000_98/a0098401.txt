The u'g'r'i'z' filter system, developed for use for the
              Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), has recently gained rapid acceptance as a
              major filter system for the coming decade's wide-field astronomical projects --
               projects which will be conducted at both northern and southern hemisphere
              observatories.  The SDSS, however, is a northern hemisphere survey, and the
              present network of 164 u'g'r'i'z' standards, established especially for use in
              SDSS operations, is geared for northern hemisphere observations.  To meet the
              need for southern u'g'r'i'z' standards Dr. J. Allyn Smith, at the University of
              Wyoming, will lead a program to use the facilities of the Cerro Tololo
              Interamerican Observatory in Chile to calibrate a series of  southern
              standards.  This project is intended as a service to the general astronomical
              community.  As such, quick availability of the data product - a catalogue of
              calibrated southern u'g'r'i'z' standard stars - is a high priority.  The intent
              is to make interim versions of the southern standard star catalogue publicly
              available at the end of each of the four years of the project.  Within months
              of the completion of all observations, a final calibrated catalogue will be
              made available.  Both the interim and the final catalogues will be published on
              a publicly accessible internet site.  The final catalogue will also be
              published in a refereed journal article.
