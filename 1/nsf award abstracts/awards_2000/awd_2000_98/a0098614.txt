The Venus mesosphere is a dynamical transition region
              between the zonal rotation of the massive lower atmosphere and the subsonic
              day-to- night circulation of the thermosphere.  It is also a region of key
              photochemical activity, in which SOx, COx, and HOx catalytic cycles control
              formation of the massive sulfate cloud layer at its lower boundary, maintain
              stability of the C02 atmosphere to photolytic dissociation, and limit long-term
              escape of atmospheric water.  The extreme differences in atmospheric
              circulation and chemistry above and below the Venus mesosphere lead to very
              large diurnal and interannual variations in its circulation and composition,
              which have confounded our understanding of this remarkably dynamic regime.  Dr.
              R. Todd Clancy, of the Space Science Institute, will lead a data analysis and
              observing research program to investigate the variable thermal and
              compositional state of the Venus middle atmosphere. Millimeter spectral lines
              of 12CO, 13CO, and HDO enable unique vertical profile retrievals for
              temperature, and CO and water vapor densities at 70-110 km altitudes within the
              mesosphere. Over 100 separate measurements of existing, unanalyzed 12CO, 13CO,
              and HDO millimeter and sub-millimeter spectra will be modeled to determine the
              diurnal and interannual variabilities of CO and temperatures over the 1990-1999
              period. Cursory analysis of these observations indicates abrupt, short-term
              variations in global mesospheric temperatures at 80-95 km altitudes, a dayside
              mesopause at 95-100 km altitudes, and strong diurnal variation in mesospheric
              water vapor abundances. These are unique discoveries of diurnal and secular
              variabilities in the Venus middle atmosphere that require comprehensive
              analyses of the full data set to quantify and publish results. In addition, new
              millimeter and sub-millimeter measurements will be taken over the 2000-2003
              period to extend the temporal and vertical coverages of the
              C0/temperature/water retrievals, and to determine mesospheric abundances for
              SO, S02, H2SO4, and O2.  A primary objective of the analysis is to define the
              diurnal and large interannual variations of the Venus mesosphere with the
              broadest vertical, parameter {temperature and composition) , and temporal
              description possible. The 1990-2003 period of these observations will be placed
              in the context of prior millimeter (1982-1990), Pioneer Venus orbiter
              (1978-1985) , and Galileo (1991) flyby observations to maximize the scientific
              return of these existing mesospheric measurements, and to support future
              spacecraft exploration of the Venus atmosphere. Study of the Venus mesosphere,
              in particular, draws strong parallels from the chemical and dynamical processes
              only recently defined to control the fragile terrestrial stratosphere.
