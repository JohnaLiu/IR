Abstract    :
              Approximation algorithms are efficient algorithms for
              combinatorial
optimization problems that deliver solutions which are
              guaranteed to
be within a certain factor of the optimum. This area of
              theoretical
computer science has seen a tremendous growth in the last decade
              for
various reasons. First, several important techniques for designing
such
              approximation algorithms have been discovered, including the use
of convex
              optimization techniques and more specifically semidefinite
programming. Also,
              major advances in complexity theory have lead to
strong non-approximability
              results, sometimes even showing that for
certain problems trivial
              approximation algorithms give the best
guarantee one could hope for (unless
              P=NP).

In this project, which is a continuation of the PI prior CAREER
              award,
the emphasis is both on the design of general techniques for
              deriving
approximation algorithms and also on obtaining improved
              approximation
algorithms for several classical hard optimization problems.
              The
problems to be considered include routing problems, the
              traveling
salesman problem, the Steiner tree problem, the sparsest cut
              problem,
and scheduling problems.
