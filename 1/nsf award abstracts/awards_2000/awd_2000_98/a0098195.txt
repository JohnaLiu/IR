Abstract    :
              This work continues the study of atomic dynamics by the direct solution of the
              time-dependent Schrodinger equation on a numerical lattice, focusing on the
              dynamics of Rydberg and continuum states.   There are projects involving the
              dynamics of multi-electron wave packets and projects involving the solution of
              time-dependent close-coupling equations for multi-electron dynamics.  New
              theoretical and computational tools will be developed.
