Abstract    :
              At the froniters of elementary particle physics, experiments
seek to produce
              previously-unobserved  states of matter and 
to detect forces unseen since the
              big bang.  To interpret
these searches, it is necessary to understand the
              workings
of the strong force, quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which
binds
              together the nuclei of atoms, and which plays a
crucial role in all such
              experiments.
The CTEQ Summer Schools are designed to equip
              junior
experimentalists in elementary particle physics with the
background in
              QCD necessary to interpret current, and to envision new,
probes of the
              structure of the universe,
incuding investigations
of QCD itself.  CTEQ
              Schools involve close interaction between students
and distinguished
              lecturers.  The 2001 school is a collaboration
between CTEQ (Coordinated
              Theoretical-Experimental Project on QCD)
and the United Kingdom's Institute
              for Particle
Physics Phenomenology, based in Durham, England.
