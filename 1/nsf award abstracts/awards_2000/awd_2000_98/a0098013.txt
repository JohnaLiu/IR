              ABSTRACT
Proposal #0098013
Johns Hopkins University

The proposed research
              is concerned with three contemporary topics in the area of variational
              inequalities and complementarity problems. These topics are: (a) mathematical
              programs with equilibrium constraints, (b) quasi-variational inequalities, and
              (c) differential complementarity systems. In each case, our focus is on the
              design, implementation, and analysis of robust and efficient numerical methods
              for solving the problems under study. The proposed methods will be supported by
              a strong theoretical foundation that serves to provide an in-depth undertanding
              of the problems. Applications of the developed theory and computational
              algorithms to important disciplinary problems in engineering design, parameter
              identification, economic equilibria, electric power planning and pricing,
              constrained mechanical systems, and derivative pricing in financial engineering
              will also be carefully investigated. Overall, our research is built on the past
              success we have had in this vast subarea of mathematical programming. The main
              goal of the project is to expand this subarea in some new unchartered domains
              of applications that urgently require the kind of computational research
              proposed herein.
