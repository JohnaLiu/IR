Abstract    :
              The project is devoted to dynamical systems of physical origin, 
including
              Lorentz gases (both in equilibrium and under external 
forces), hard ball
              systems, billiards, ideal gases with a massive 
test particle, and open
              Hamiltonian systems. Most of these are 
known (or expected) to have chaotic
              behavior. Due to recent works 
of D. Dolgopyat, D. Ruelle, Ya. Sinai, L.-S.
              Young and others, 
mathematical tools in the theory of hyperbolic and chaotic
              
dynamical systems appear to be developed far enough to attack many 
open
              problems that have been so far only studied heuristically or 
numerically by
              physicists, if at all. In particular, we plan to 
investigate the nature of
              nonequilibrium steady states by means of 
Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen measures, time
              correlation functions that 
appear in transport laws and diffusion equations,
              open Hamiltonian 
systems that admit conditionally invariant  measures, the
              motion 
of a massive particle in an ideal gas by using an appropriate
              
space-time limit, etc. In each case we aim at obtaining exact 
results and
              providing solid rigorous proofs. 

The general goal of the project is to
              conduct mathematical studies 
of facts and phenomena that have attracted
              attention in physical 
community and have applications outside of mathematics.
              In 
particular, the results would contribute to the mathematical 
foundation
              of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics and could 
strengthen the link
              between the theory of dynamical systems and 
physics and other sciences.
