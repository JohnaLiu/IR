Abstract    :
              To meet rapidly increasing demand for satellite communications and broadcast
              services, there is a need for more bandwidth efficient techniques, and the use
              of higher level modulations is a natural choice. However, higher level
              modulations suffer relatively more performance degradation from satellite
              amplifier nonlinearity. This research focuses on the design and analysis of
              digital transmission for the nonlinear satellite channel, especially as regards
              the combination of highly efficient coded modulation, signal processing and
              decoding algorithms.  

The research involves a comprehensive plan to develop
              and compare coded modulation, predistortion, equalization, and decoding
              algorithms for high-rate bandwidth-efficient nonlinear satellite channels (3
              bits/symbol information rate and higher). Previous results of the investigator
              showed that with effective predistortion, the nonlinear channel is
              well-approximated by a peak power constrained but otherwise linear channel, and
              suitably optimized (12,4) PSK is superior to 16 QAM trellis coded modulation
              (TCM). The present work is focused on the following topics: (1) Higher rate TCM
              and multidimensional TCM for the predistorted channel; (2) Combined
              equalization and decoding of TCM in the nonlinear channel; (3) Turbo trellis
              coded modulation (TTCM) in the nonlinear channel, which may be powerful enough
              to not require predistortion or equalization; and (4) Hierarchical coded
              modulation in the nonlinear channel, which is suitable for variable error rate
              protection and/or backward compatibility. Although the focus is on ground-based
              transmitter or receiver techniques with a high power travelling wave tube
              amplifier (TWTA) transponder, the work is also applicable to on-board
              linearization of low power satellite amplifier or even in-hand linearization of
              a cell phone provided that a digitally generated signal is amplified (versus
              analog combining), because there is still the fundamental problem of bandwidth
              and power-efficient coded 
modulation design subject to a peak power
              constraint.
