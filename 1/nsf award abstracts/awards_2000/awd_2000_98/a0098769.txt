Abstract    :
              The investigator proposes to use Kontsevich's space of "stable
              maps"
(originally motivated by mathematical physics last decade) and
              related
objects to tackle problems in a variety of fields. Traditionally,
              the
space of stable maps has been studied using facts about the
              fundamental
"moduli space of curves" defined by Deligne and Mumford.  The
              investigator
proposes to conversely study the moduli space of curves by
              studying maps
from curves to varieties.  Some of the proposed work will likely
              rely on
Jun Li's recent extension of Kontsevich's work, the definition of a
              space
of "relative stable maps" in the algebraic category.

It has long been
              known that nodal algebraic curves are a powerful tool in
algebraic geometry. 
              They can be thought of as surfaces with holes
(picture a ball, a donut, or a
              french cruller) with pairs of points "glued
together".  Earlier this decade,
              ideas from string theory in physics led
to the introduction of "stable maps",
              parametrizing certain kinds of maps
of nodal curves into another space.  This
              development has proved to be
incredibly fruitful, sparking advances in a
              variety of fields. The
investigator's area of research is the use of these
              ideas in the field of
algebraic geometry, in particular with applications to
              many other fields
(such as enumerative geometry, arithmetic geometry,
              combinatorics, and
physics).
