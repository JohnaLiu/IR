Abstract    :
              A broad program of research in theoretical physics will
address outstanding
              issues of the fundamental
constituents of matter, and the laws and forces
              through 
which they interact to build the universe that we 
observe. Studies
              will address the crucial, but 
incompletely understood, quantum-mechanical
              processes by 
which quarks and gluons, when they are temporarily freed 
from
              protons and neutrons in collisions at high-energy 
accelerators, evolve back
              into common particles 
such as the proton, and into exotic entities such as
              
the recently-discovered top quark and the still sought-after 
Higgs boson.
              Other studies will center on the rapidly-developing 
science of neutrinos,
              where recent experiments are stimulating 
theoretical insights, from the
              dynamics of the sun to the evolution of
the universe, and are serving as a
              link between particle 
physics and cosmology. Ongoing investigations will also
              develop superstring 
theory, the exciting candidate for a unification
              of
gravity, felt by all matter, with the nuclear forces
felt by quarks and
              gluons, the electric and magnetic 
forces felt by electrons, and weak forces
              felt by neutrinos. 
The aim of superstring theory is a complete picture of the
              dynamic processes,
and even the geometry, that make up our world.
