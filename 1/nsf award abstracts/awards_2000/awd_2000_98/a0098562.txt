The Milky Way's dominant star-forming structure, the 5
              kiloparsec ring, remains largely unexplored.  Using the new SEQUOIA multi-pixel
              array receiver on the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory 14-meter
              telescope, Dr. James Jackson and his colleagues at Boston University are
              conducting a new molecular line survey of the inner Galaxy -- the Boston
              University--Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory Galactic Ring Survey
              (GRS).  During the course of this award, the group will complete four key
              science projects:  1. Cataloging molecular clouds and cloud cores discovered
              during the GRS.  2. Establishing kinematic distances to molecular clouds and
              their embedded infrared star-forming regions.  3. Determining the structure of
              the inner Milky Way, and especially that of the 5 kiloparsec ring.  4.
              Quantifying and testing models of the internal structure of molecular clouds. 
              When complete, the GRS will be the definitive map of the molecular gas
              distribution in the inner Galaxy, and it will be a vital resource for
              generations of Galactic astronomers.
