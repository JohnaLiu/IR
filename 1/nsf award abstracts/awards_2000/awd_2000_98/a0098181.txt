Abstract    :
              
Optimization with few violated constraints is a variant of the standard
              optimization in which a small number of constraints may be violated. It is
              especially useful when some of constraints are not reliable due to modeling
              uncertainty and/or measurement errors. In this proposal, we show that several
              control problems can be solved within the framework of opti-mization with few
              violated constraints. One example is a convergent and numerically efficient
              algoritlini for robust system identification in the presence of
              outliers.

Unlike the standard optimization, however, optimization with few
              violated constraints has received little attention in the literature and few
              results are available. After demonstrating a need for optimization with few
              violated constraints for controls, we present our preliminary results in the
              proposal which include the problem set up, preliminary analysis and a numerical
              algorithm for solving optimization with few violated constraints. The algorithm
              is proven to have a low computational complexity. Preliminary results are very
              promising. Then, a detailed research plan in terms of the algorithm and its
              application is outlined in the proposal.
