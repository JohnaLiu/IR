Abstract    :
              The project studies the physics of processes in which slow electrons induce
              heavy particle motion.  The low energy electron motion requires a quantum
              mechanical treatment, while the heavy particle motion is classical.  The focus
              is on dissociative electron attachment to different targets and in different
              environments. Targets to be considered include diatomic molecules, polyatomic
              molecules, clusters, physisorbed molecules, and molecules embedded in a crystal
              medium.  The project will also consider the theory of inelastic and charge
              transfer processes in collisions of Rydberg atoms with ground state atoms.
