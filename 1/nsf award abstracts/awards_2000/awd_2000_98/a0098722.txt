Temperature profiles of Jupiter's atmosphere are important
              for understanding the energy balance, interpreting reflectance spectra or
              thermal emission, and studying dynamics.  In all of these parameters, the
              temperature gradients are nearly as important as the temperatures themselves,
              and vertically-resolved measurements of temperature are needed.  Similarly the
              methane distribution is central for understanding the chemistry and radiative
              balance.  Dr. Leslie Young, at the Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, CO, 
              will utilize the occultation observing technique to measure the vertical
              profiles of temperature and methane density.  She will prepare a catalog of
              ultraviolet bright stars that will be occulted by giant planets, and can be
              observed from Earth orbiting telescopes, and  she will obtain
              spectrally-resolved observations of Io's hotspot occultations by Jupiter,
              measuring stratospheric temperatures and methane abundance.   The occultations
              of Io's hotspots by Jupiter will be observed using the SpeX spectrometer at the
              Infrared Telescope Facility on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.  The resulting light curves
              will be used to derive temperatures and methane densities in Jupiter's lower
              stratosphere, at pressures, latitudes, and vertical resolutions needed to
              detect and quantify the predicted thermal structure.
