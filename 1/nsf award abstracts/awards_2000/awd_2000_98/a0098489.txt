With the support of this award, Dr. Michael Briley,
              University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, will increase the depth and breadth of our
              understanding of the light element abundance inhomogeneities found in globular
              clusters in the Galaxy.  These objects are of particular interest in astronomy
              because of their roles as laboratories for the study of how low mass stars
              evolve, and because they are some of the oldest objects for which reliable ages
              may be obtained.  As such, they contain at least a partial chemical record of
              events and conditions during their formation.  Dr. Briley has laid out an
              observing/analysis campaigns to address a major data deficiency in the chemical
              records of globular cluster stars.  The projects have been chosen not only for
              potential contribution to the field of astronomy, but also because of their
              accessibility to faculty and students in a primarily undergraduate institution
              where the bulk of the work will take place.  This award is made through the
              Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program in the Division of
              Astronomical Sciences at NSF.
