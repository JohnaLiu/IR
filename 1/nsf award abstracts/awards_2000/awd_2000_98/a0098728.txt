"Crustal Dynamics in Neutron Stars"
AST-0098728

In astronomy,
              we commonly encounter physical conditions quite unfamiliar to us here on Earth.
               It gives us a chance to test physical theories which apply locally in order to
              see if they remain valid at extremes.  Neutron stars represent one such
              extreme.  Not only can we study properties of matter at almost incredibly high
              densities but also they are accompanied frequently by extremely strong and
              intense magnetic fields.  Recent research has shown that neutron stars lead far
              from peaceful lives.  Starquakes occur through cracking of the neutron star
              surface or crust and can cause large-scale realignments of the star's magnetic
              field.  These may generate gamma-ray outbursts that can be detected by space
              observatories.  During the course of this award four aspects of the effects of
              crust rigidity and their connection with spin behavior of the pulsar.  Amongst
              other objectives, the work looks to determine the stage at which crust cracking
              begins and will provide estimates of the energy thereby released.
