This award to Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium
              provides instrumentation to update and expand the oceanographic research
              capabilities of the research vessel Pelican, a ship operated by LUMCON as part
              of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research
              fleet.  The laboratory grade water purifier system, computers and related
              instrumentation, gravity corer, sea water samplers, CTD altimeter,
              meteorological instruments, and electronic instrumentation for automated
              seawater analyses will all be available as shared-use tools for all scientific
              users of the research ship.  These improvements will be of substantial
              advantage to marine scientists using the ship in their research during 2001 and
              future years.
