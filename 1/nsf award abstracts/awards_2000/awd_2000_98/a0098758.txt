Abstract    :
              
This project addresses certain fundamental aspects of the electroweak
and
              strong interactions that are reflected in meson and nucleon
properties and
              interactions at low/intermediate energies.  The
research is motivated by the
              fact that the present comprehensive
theory--the Standard Model (SM)--is known
              to be incomplete;
furthermore, the SM becomes unworkable for strong
              interactions at low
energies.

The rare beta decay of the pi-meson (pion),
              occurring once in about
100 million ordinary pion decays, provides a
              theoretically clean
window to certain allowed extensions of the SM.  The
              PIBETA
experiment, mounted at the Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland, by
              an
international collaboration of seven institutions led by the
University of
              Virginia (UVa) group, aims to improve the present 4%
accuracy of the pion beta
              decay rate by about a factor of ten in a
staged approach, in order to match
              the theoretical uncertainty and
provide new constraints on physics beyond the
              SM.  Measurements that
began in 1999 will continue through 2001.  PIBETA is
              the main effort
of the present research project.  Additional commitments of
              effort
include work on studies of nucleon and meson structure at
              Stanford
(SLAC) and Jefferson Lab (CLAS collaboration).

During the past
              three years this program has resulted in two doctoral
degrees at UVa plus
              three more at collaborating universities stemming
from the PIBETA project
              alone.  Four more UVa Ph.D. degrees are
expected in the next three to four
              years.  Each year typically one to
two undergraduate students are engaged in
              research on this project,
thus gaining practical laboratory experience.
