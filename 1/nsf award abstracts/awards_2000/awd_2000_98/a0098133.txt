This project will develop
              preconditioned Krylov subspace methods with analysis for computing a few
              eigenvalues of a large generalized eigenvalue problem Ax = lambda Bx, and study
              their robust implementations with a long term goal to develop a specialized
              package for public distributions. The
resulting algorithms should inherit
              desirable characteristics of the existing Krylov subspace methods, but
extend
              their capability for efficient preconditioning. The feasibility of this
              objective has been demonstrated by a preliminary study that led to an algorithm
              of this type for computing the smallest eigenvalue of a symmetric definite
              problem. In this project, this preliminary work will be strengthened and its
              idea further developed and generalized to produce algorithms that are capable
              of delivering extreme as well as interior eigenvalues for symmetric as well as
              nonsymmetric problems alike.

This project builds upon the PI's research
              expertise and contributions over the past decade, to significantly advance the
              state-of-the-art of numerical methods for large matrix eigenvalue problems.
              Unifying several existing ideas and concepts and bringing new approaches, the
              resulting methods would be an ideal topics for classroom learning and thesis
              research. Moreover, the preliminary study indicates that they would be well
              suited for black-box implementations and thus have the potential to reach a
              broader application community.
