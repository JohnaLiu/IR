Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for initiating a project to study the properties of
              slow light and its interaction with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC).   Within
              the course of the project, attempts will be made to reduce the speed of light
              to 1 cm/sec in the BEC.  At this point the light speed is equivalent to the
              speed of sound in the condensate, and a number of predictions have been made
              about the condensate behavior.   One is that atoms will surf on the front of
              the light pulse and that the propagating pulse will lose energy by exciting
              vibrations of the condensate.  Secondly, shock waves can be generated and
              observed. Finally, the observation of quantized vortices is possible below the
              transition temperature for Bose-Einstein condensation.   All these phenomena
              will be addressed in the experiments.
