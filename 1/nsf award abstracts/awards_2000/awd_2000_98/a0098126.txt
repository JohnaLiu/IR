Abstract    :
              The project studies typed heterogeneous meta-programming systems where the
              meta-language and the object-language are different languages, with different
              type systems.  The objective of the project is to design and implement a system
              with a fixed meta-language, in which it is possible to build different systems
              with different object-languages, or one system with multiple
              object-languages.

The project studies how to integrate the multiple type
              systems that must coexist in a heterogeneous meta programming system. The type
              system of the meta-language must be extensible, in  a manner that makes it
              possible to incorporate the type systems of arbitrary object languages. The
              goal is to produce a system where type correct meta-programs produce only
              type-correct object-programs. Ideas from extensible kinds, higher-order
              abstract syntax, intensional analysis of code, indexed-types, and the use of
              constrained type systems will be investigated as mechanisms to accomplish these
              goals.
