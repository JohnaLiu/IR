This award to Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the
              University of California, San Diego, provides instrumentation to upgrade the
              IGPP Digital Library with the addition of tape storage systems, server,
              software upgrades and related items.  The facility is used to store a wide
              variety of geophysical and oceanographic information, allowing collaboration
              among widely-separated research groups, and maintaining direct access to a
              wealth of historical information.  This upgrade will increase speed to access
              data, and will more than double existing capacity for online data storage to
              more than 20 Tbytes.  These improvements will be of substantial advantage to
              ocean scientists using the facility in their research during 2001 and future
              years.
