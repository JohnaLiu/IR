Abstract    :
              Quantum effects around and inside black holes will be studied. New tools
will
              be developed to extend present abilities in calculating vacuum
stress-energy
              tensors, and efforts made to make these tools of
sufficient simplicity and
              portability so that they may be adopted and
used by other research groups.
              Further connections between semiclassical
gravitational studies of extreme
              black holes and their role in
superstring theories will be sought. Existing
              results on extreme,
zero-temperature black holes, which play a critical role
              in superstring
theories, will be extended to include black holes in spacetimes
              with a
nonzero cosmological constant, and to rotating black holes. 

These 
              studies will further illuminate the connection between black
holes and quantum
              physics, providing new insights into properties of
theories of quantum gravity
              and helping to establish connections between
superstring theories and more
              "conventional" approaches to the
quantization of spacetime.
