Abstract    :
              The explosive growth of the World Wide Web, the variety of information hosted by
              a given site, the rapid fluctuations in user demand, and the complexity of the
              preferred architectural trend are among the reasons that make increasingly
              challenging for system administrators to effectively mange today's complex web
              server systems.  This proposal addresses this problem by seeking to develop
              smart algorithms that help performing difficult tasks such as web server
              cluster configuration, capacity planning, fault management and load balancing,
              by continuously monitoring and adapting to changes in the workload and system. 
              Workload mointoring will provide input to analytic models whose solution will
              in turn be used by both off-line and on-line algorithms that can propose
              improved system configurations.  To this end, the proposed research objectives
              will provide: (a) methods to derive detailed statistical workload
              characterizations of web servers, (b) new and efficient solutions for analytic
              models of systems that serve tasks drawn from heavy tail probability
              distributions, (c) a software tool particularly targeted to load balancing in
              clustered web servers, to be used by non expert modelers, including system
              administrators, and (d) workload-aware and system-aware algorithms that
              significantly improve performance and ease of web system management.
