Abstract    :
              Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) materials have tremendous potential for
              
strengthening damaged structures at low costs.  Studies have shown that the
              
load-carrying ability of FRP materials is related to the bonding of the
              
epoxy to the substrate.  One factor affecting the bond behavior is the
              
roughness of the surface.

The objectives of this project are to prepare
              surfaces of differing 
intensities and classes of roughnesses, measure the
              roughness using a laser 
profilometer, bond FRP sheets to the surfaces, and
              test the bond strengths 
with a pull-off tester. Analyses will determine which
              type of roughness 
results in the highest bond strength.
