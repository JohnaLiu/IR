Abstract    :
              The award provides travel support for US participants in the GEOMIX workshop,
              which will be held at the Institut d'Etudes Scientifiques de Cargese in
              Corsica, France from August 19 to September 1, 2001. The theme of the workshop
              is Geophysical Mixing and Transport. Research in this area---at the nexus of
              geophysics and applied mathematics---is of considerable practical importance,
              since applications abound in areas such as ozone depletion (ozone hole) in the
              high latitudes, long-range transport and transformation of chemical pollutants,
              North Atlantic thermohaline circulation, and biogeochemical processes
              controlling ocean absorption of CO2. Core funding for the workshop has been
              obtained from the European community and from Centre National du Recherche
              Scientifique (CNRS) in France. The PI, Ray Pierrehumbert, is an acknowledged
              leader in this research area, and one of the three lead organizers of the
              workshop. The NSF award should support travel of approximately 20 U.S.
              participants, primarily, advanced graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and
              early-career junior faculty. 

The Large-scale Dynamic Meteorology (GEO/ATM),
              Physical Oceanography (GEO/OCE), and Applied Math (MPS/DMS) programs are all
              equally contributing to the award funding.
