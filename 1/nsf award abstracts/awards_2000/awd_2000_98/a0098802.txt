Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed work is to investigate the vision task of coherent
              surface identification in a single image, and to use acquired knowledge for
              improvement of existing algorithms. The work is a natural extension of the PI's
              recent work on coherent surface detection, while also adding new aspects
              related to the field of object recognition. The envisioned system will be able
              to autonomously learn object recognition models from a set of images, and then
              identify those objects in a complex environment. The work has strong connection
              to vision-based robotics as applied to unknown environments.
