Abstract    :
              In this project, a plan is outlined to continue the efforts of the Student
              Meeting Activities
Subcommittee of the Power Engineering Education Committee
              of the IEEE Power
Engineering Society (PES) to promote student interest in the
              power engineering field by
sponsoring electrical engineering students from US
              universities to attend the 2001 North
American Power Symposium to be held at
              Texas A&M University in College Station,
Texas. The goal of this project is to
              provide an opportunity for students to be exposed to
the most recent
              developments in operation, construction, and research in the power
engineering
              field. This is a particularly critical time for power engineering as
              the
industry undergoes significant change due to the restructuring of the
              traditional utility
structure. The career opportunities for students
              interested in power engineering are many
and varied; the program offers
              students several opportunities to interact with faculty and
students from
              other universities in the power area.
