Abstract    :
              
This grant supports the participation of US scientists at the
              16th
International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation
              (GR16),
to be held in Durban, South Africa, July 15-21, 2001. The "GR"
              meetings
are the oldest international meetings where approximately 500-1000
              
researchers worldwide convene to present and discuss their work, having
been
              held regularly every three years since the late 50's.

The funds will be
              distributed by a committee of leading US researchers
and will consist of
              partial travel support.
