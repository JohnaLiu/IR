Understanding the birth and evolution
              of planets is one of the most intriguing and challenging tasks in modern
              astronomy. During the period of this award, the PI and his team will use
              state-of-the-art infrared imagers, built mainly by themselves, to image the
              distribution of warm dust in disks. The imagers will be used at many of the
              world's largest 8 and 10m telescopes. They are sensitive to mid-infrared
              radiation from 8 to 25 microns that is emitted by the dust within several
              hundred astronomical units of the star. Key program goals are to critically
              constrain how coalescence and planet formation can proceed and to look for disk
              distortions and other signatures resulting from the influence of planets that
              have already formed.
