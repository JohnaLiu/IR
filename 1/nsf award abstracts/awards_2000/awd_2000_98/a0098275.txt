Abstract    :
              The advance of high-speed deep-submicron VLSI technology requires
              chip
interconnect and packaging to be modeled by distributed circuits. Such
              a
detailed modeling level eventually results in large scale linear circuits
              to
be analyzed. Thus, the research objective is to develop new circuit
              order
reduction approach to evaluate the circuit performance and
              characteristics
in a reasonable time period and with a guaranteed performance,
              as required
by real design practice.

This project focuses on the following
              tasks:
a) Develop new order reduction approaches that provide guaranteed
              performance;
b) Derive correspondingly high efficiency numerical methods;
c)
              Investigate the methods of maintaining preferred characteristics in
              the
reduced order system as well as related implementation issues;
d)
              Investigate wavelet method application in model order reduction and
analysis;
              and
e) Contribute to graduate education at UT- Dallas and
              UNC-Charlotte.

The expected research results will provide efficient and
              performance
guaranteed methods for order reduction and analysis of VLSI
              interconnect
circuits, and their corresponding algorithms and software for
              simulation
test.  It will also contribute to engineering and science aspects
              by the
expected research results and software, as well as to graduate
              education.
