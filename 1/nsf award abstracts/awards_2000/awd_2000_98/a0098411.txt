Dr. Karen Magee-Sauer, at Rowan University, will
              measure and compare abundances of acetylene, hydrogen cyanide, and ammonia in
              several comets.  The composition of native ices is a fundamental question in
              cometary science.  Their characterization is central to identifying the
              processes that occurred during formation of the Solar System.  The focus of
              this project is to utilize the rapidly expanding field of ground-based infrared
              spectroscopy to determine cometary composition through quantitative
              measurements of several key volatile species.  The high spectral and spatial
              resolution afforded by long-slit infrared spectroscopy enable the detection of
              multiple emission features of each species, and yield information on their
              productions.  Under favorable conditions, the spatial profiles can separately
              identify material released form the nucleus from that produced in the coma. 
              This will help answer the basic question of the composition of natal ices in
              comets, and help constrain models of Solar System formation.  This project is
              funded under the Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program at
              NSF.
