Subdwarf B stars are among the brightest of highly evolved
              stars. The suggested binary star origin for most of them becomes important in
              several diverse areas of contemporary astrophysics ranging from stellar
              population studies in external galaxies to the common envelope evolution in
              interacting binary stars. This award is for continuing work in obtaining the
              remaining observations necessary for determining the binary properties and for
              comparing these properties with theoretical expectations. An extensive
              spectroscopic program is planned using University of Arizona observing
              facilities. Most studies to date concern binary stars with the largest velocity
              amplitude. To fully understand the range of possible orbital parameters, the
              new observations will be directed towards a kinematically unbiased sample. Once
              the orbital ephemerides are known, precise photometric monitoring will be
              carried out in order to search for eclipses, reflection effects and ellipsoidal
              variations that will put additional constraints on the binary star
              parameters.
