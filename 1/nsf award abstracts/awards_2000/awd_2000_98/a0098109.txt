Abstract    :
              The award made to Dr. Evan Williams of the University of California at Berkeley
              entitled "Hydration of Biomolecules and Metal Ions Investigated by Mass
              Spectrometry" is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program. 
              The goal of the research is to increase the fundamental knowledge of how the
              properties of biomolecules change as they change from isolated species in the
              gas phase to solution phase species.  There are four research objectives, 1)
              characterizing the formation of zwitterions in hydrated ion-amino acid
              clusters, 2) measuring the binding energies of hydrated peptides and alkaline
              earth dications, 3) determining the structures of  hydrated peptides and
              alkaline earth dications, and 4) establishing the reaction rates of hydrated
              dication-amino acid clusters.  The work will be performed on specialized
              equipment which includes electrospray ionization with Blackbody Infrared
              Radiative Dissociation (BIRD) on an ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. 
              The research related to the enhanced BIRD cell design is both original and
              creative.

This fundamental research into gas phase ion chemistry; kinetics,
              thermochemistry, structure and mechanism is ambitious and novel.  The research
              will have a significant impact because it bridges the gap between gas phase
              physical chemical studies and solution phase biomolecular chemistry and because
              it will impact each field individually as well.
