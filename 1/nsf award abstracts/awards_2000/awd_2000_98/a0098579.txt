The spectacular jets observed to emanate from the
              nuclei of quasars and other active galaxies represent the most energetic
              long-lived phenomenon in the universe.  Decades after the discovery of jets,
              astrophysicists are still struggling to explain how ultra-hot,
              magnetized,plasma is ejected into narrow beams from a system involving a black
              hole weighing millions or billions of suns swallowing gas from its environment.
              This project will explore the properties of these jets - the flow speeds (which
              are very close to the speed of light), the magnetic field, the energization of
              electrons, and wiggling of the nozzle - and how these depend on time,
              frequency, and energy output. These will provide clues needed to figure out the
              physical mechanisms that control the jets. They will be accomplished through
              repeated observations at radio, infrared, and
optical wavelengths with
              world-class telescopes to obtain images and multiple snapshots of spectra of
              the radiation emitted by the jets. Funding for this project was provided by the
              NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology (AST/EXC).
