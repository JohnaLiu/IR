Abstract    :
              The investigators will determine the properties of an Earth-based radar capable
              of detecting fast Earth-directed solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs).  The
              objective is to assess the feasibility of detecting such events by means of
              ground-based solar coronal radars and to identify the scientific potential of
              such observations for enhancing the understanding of the early development of
              coronal mass ejections.  A detailed description of the properties of an
              Earth-based radar capable of detecting fast Earth-directed CMEs will be
              developed, including those characteristics that would facilitate continuous
              monitoring for such events.  Radar parameters that best separate the CME radar
              signature from the background coronal echo will be determined by comparing the
              expected signature with past observations of coronal echoes.  Major
              Earth-directed CMEs have been identified as harbingers of severe space weather
              at Earth.  As the consequent solar wind disturbance takes a day or more to
              reach Earth, early detection of such events would provide a means to prepare
              for the possible impacts on technical systems.
