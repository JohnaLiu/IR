Abstract    :
              This research will use a specially-targeted subsample of luminous elliptical
              galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to probe the galaxy
              distribution power spectrum on large scales, and to study the evolution of
              massive galaxies.  The sample is called the "Bright Red Galaxy Sample,"
              consisting of roughly 100,000 galaxies out to a redshift of 0.5, and is
              designed so that galaxies at low and high redshift should have similar
              intrinsic properties.  The goals are to determine precision constraints from
              large-scale structure on the low-redshift balance of matter, cosmological
              constant, and spatial curvature.  These results will complement those from
              cosmic microwave background anisotropies and distant supernovae and should
              contribute substantially to the construction of a well-tested cosmological
              model.
