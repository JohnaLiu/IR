This is a collaborative research project involving
              scientists at 3 institutions:  Dr. Edward Olszewski, at the University of
              Arizona, Dr. Mario Mateo, at the University of Michigan, and Dr. Heather
              Morrison, at Case Western Reserve University.  These researchers are mapping a
              region of our Galaxy that was hitherto unreachable.  They will complete an
              imaging survey that has been underway for several years, and they will carry
              out a comprehensive spectroscopic follow-up of halo-star candidates identified
              in the survey.  The survey is undertaken to directly assess the degree to which
              accretion has formed the majority of the Galaxy's halo.  The main focus of the
              survey is finding candidate halo stars that inhabit the outer parts of the
              Galactic halo.  The final sample of halo stars from the survey will allow
              placement of strong limits on the existence of halo substructure and will very
              likely provide direct evidence of such structure if it comprises more than 10%
              to 20% of the luminous halo.  

A profound change is underway in how
              astronomers believe galaxies, such as ours, formed.  Older notions of a single,
              monolithic collapse of the outer Galaxy on a relatively short timescale have
              begun to be superseded by the idea that much of the Galaxy formed from the
              accretion of much smaller systems over the entire age of the Universe.  Most
              data supporting this accretion-driven model is somewhat indirect and involves
              expectations of sophisticated models of how galaxies form in an expanding
              Universe.  Recently, the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy has provided strong evidence
              that at least part of our halo stars and clusters have come from an accreted
              satellite.
