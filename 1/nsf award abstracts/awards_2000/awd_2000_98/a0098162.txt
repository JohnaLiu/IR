Reliable Multithreaded Software
William Pugh

Multithreading is
              useful for providing responsive software, particularly in the face of user
              input and network connections with unpredictable latency.  Multithreading
              allows transparent use of shared memory multiprocessors (SMPs) and
              multithreaded uniprocessors (e.g., Sun's MAJC, Alpha-EV8).  Unfortunately,
              writing reliable multithreaded programs is difficult.

This research defines
              a formal semantics for multithreaded Java, and works to understand the
              interaction of that semantics with the compiler and run-time system.  The
              results of this effort should be transferable to other languages and systems
              that incorporate threads (e.g., C# and C++ with Pthreads).

The research
              effort also performs software archaeology on existing multithreaded systems,
              documenting data races that have already been fixed and using dynamic and
              static tools to search for other potential data races.  The effort studies both
              large open source efforts (e.g., Linux kernel, FreeBSD kernel, Apache, Tomcat)
              and smaller systems.

Education, both at universities and for professionals,
              will form an important component of this research effort.  This effort will
              both illuminate which concepts and forms of instruction are most effective, and
              also generate material that can be widely disseminated and used by others in
              instruction.
