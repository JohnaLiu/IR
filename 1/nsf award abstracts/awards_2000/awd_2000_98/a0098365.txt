Star formation
              is of central importance in modern astrophysics. Stars, particularly massive
              stars, have a profound effect on their environment through both the winds they
              produce and the radiation they emit. The overall goal of the research covered
              by this award is to understand how stars form from the turbulent interstellar
              medium and how, in turn, energy injection from stars determines the properties
              of the interstellar medium out of which the stars form. A series of
              investigations is proposed, each of which is concerned with the problem of star
              formation both in our galaxy and in disk galaxies other than our own. In our
              own galaxy, special attention will be given to the process of low-mass star
              formation. Star formation in large clusters will also be investigated. Large
              clusters contain stars much more massive than the Sun and it is not at all
              clear how star formation can even proceed in the presence of the environmental
              disruption produced by just the first few stars. A third effort addressed
              during the present award will be an attempt to understand the distribution of
              gas among various phases. The relative proportions of molecular, cold atomic
              and warm atomic gas will be determined which will lead in turn to a
              self-consistent star formation rate within galaxies in general.
