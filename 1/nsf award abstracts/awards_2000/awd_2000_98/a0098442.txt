In the course of this award, the goal is to advance our
              understanding of planetary nebulae and the late stages of stellar evolution for
              stars with low and intermediate mass. New high-resolution images of planetary
              nebulae and their progenitors are leading to a re-evaluation of the mechanism
              by which the nebulae are shaped. The new observations have revealed features
              that cannot be explained by pure hydrodynamic theories. In addition, the winds
              from cool giants which precede the protoplanetary planetary nebula stage
              apparently lack the energy for radiative driving of the expanding gas shells.
              During the period covered by this award, magnetic fields will be incorporated
              to see to what extent the observations can be understood better with the
              inclusion of magnetohydrodynamics in the theoretical framework. A new computer
              code will be developed for this purpose that is expected to have wide
              application to other stars which display prominent circumstellar
              nebulae.
