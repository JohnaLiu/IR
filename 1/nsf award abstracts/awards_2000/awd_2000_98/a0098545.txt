Abstract    :
              This is a combined project in atomic photoionization and ion-molecule
              scattering.  In the first part of the project the group will study the angular
              momentum partitioning of the electronic components of the Ar atom when it is
              photoionized by circularly polarized synchrotron radiation.   By determining
              the spin components of the residual excited ion and free electron, the group
              will be able to quantify the importance of relativistic, spin-orbit
              interactions in the photo process.  In the second part of the project the group
              will study the highly correlated motion of three massive Coulomb interacting
              particles when the total energy of the three particles is a few eV above the
              continuum.   The response of the three-body motion to a change in mass
              dependent variables of momentum and energy will provide information regarding
              the important parameter of energy sharing in three body systems.
