The PI will re-examine old interpretational questions in the
              foundations of quantum mechanics in the light of new developments in quantum
              computation which focus on the quantum state exclusively as a way of
              manipulating of transmitting (digital) information.
A self-contained
              introduction to the quantum theory will be formulated that is entirely
              accessible to computer scientists unacquainted with contemporary physics, as a
              generalization of how one defines and manipulates the ordinary bits of
              classical information theory.
