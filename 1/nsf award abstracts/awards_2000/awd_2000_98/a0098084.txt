Abstract    :
              	This project deals with two major areas of mathematical relativity
which
              border on the fields of 3-manifold topology on the one hand
              and
numerical/experimental relativity on the other. The first research
topic
              treats the question of how the spatial topology of the universe
affects its
              long-time evolution. The second topic involves the
development of an efficient
              and accurate numerical scheme for the
computation of gravitational waves
              produced by colliding black holes.
	The importance of the first topic is that
              it seeks to unify the study
of the evolutionary properties of the universe
              with various
geometrization results and conjectures from pure mathematics,
              thereby
broadening the scope of results in either field of study.
              The
importance of the second topic is that it seeks to support
              the
experimental search for gravitational waves by improving the
theoretical
              understanding of possible sources of such waves.
