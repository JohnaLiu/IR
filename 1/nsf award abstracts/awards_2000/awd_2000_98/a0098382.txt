Abstract    :
              The proposed work addresses a variety of issues related to motion planning of
              complex systems: development and application of statistical methods to reduce
              the effect of the "course of dimensionality" in configuration-based motion
              planning; constructing stochastic models of mechanical systems to account for
              noise in low-level sensing and actuation and its effect on high-level planning;
              coordination of multi-robot swarms and their biological analogues. The obtained
              results will be tested on holonomic as well as non-holonomic systems, and also
              applied to studying other complex systems, such as protein molecules.
