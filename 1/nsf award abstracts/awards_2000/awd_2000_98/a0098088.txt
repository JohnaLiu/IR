Abstract    :
              Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will focus on the 
study of
              the symmetries and the dynamics of string theory, quantum 
field theories and
              integrable quantum spin chains.  A better 
understanding of the symmetries of
              physical models will give us 
detailed information about the interaction of
              particles.  String 
theory is the only known consistent candidate for a
              unifying model of 
all the fundamental interactions (forces) of nature
              including 
gravity.  The study of symmetries will lead to new quantitative
              
methods for computing quantities of physical interest, such as the 
masses
              of the elementary particles.  The investigations of integrable 
quantum field
              theories and spin chains will provide exact results for 
such quantities and
              will serve as test beds for many ideas.  This 
work is significant for
              quantifying our understanding of the 
elementary particles and the forces of
              nature.
