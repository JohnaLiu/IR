Abstract    :
              The objective of Dr. George Gatewood's long term astrometric program at
              Allegheny Observatory is to provide high precision astrometric data for groups
              of astrophysically interesting stars that either can not or will not be studied
              by other techniques.  These include stars that are too bright for CCD observing
              systems and for the FAME spacecraft, as well as stars for which the motion is
              too slow for detection by short term (5years) astrometric programs. 
              

Theoretical understanding of the formation and evolution of stellar systems
              sometimes requires a data base extending over decades.  Because they are the
              best studied, the bright stars are often the most informative examples that can
              be studied.  The study of triple and quadruple star systems yield indications
              of the formation and evolution processes of stars and brown dwarfs, as opposed
              to that of planetary systems.  Detections of the long term motions of
              apparently single stars are giving us the first indications of planetary
              systems that are similar to the Solar System.
