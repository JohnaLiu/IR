This program will use BOLOCAM, a high-throughput,
              multi-wavelength, mm-wave camera designed for operation at 1.1 mm, 1.4 mm, and
              2.1 mm, to image the arcminute-scale anisotropy of the Cosmic Microwave
              Background (CMB) over significant areas of the sky. Using BOLOCAM at the
              Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO), it will be possible to survey 1 square
              degree of sky.   Such a survey would detect > 100 clusters of galaxies via the
              thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE). In addition, it would measure the power
              spectrum of secondary CMB anisotropy (due to fluctuations in the thermal SZE
              associated with large-scale structure along the line of sight) at multipole
              moments  of 4000 to 8000 (angular scales of 1.5 to 3 arcminutes). The utility
              of these observations will be maximized by choosing the target fields to
              coincide with those targeted by the SIRTF MIPS team for their deep
              guaranteed-time observations. In addition to being
relatively free of galactic
              foregrounds and having deep infrared coverage from the MIPS and IRAC on SIRTF,
              these fields include some of the deepest integrations expected from the EPIC
              instrument on the XMM X-ray satellite.
