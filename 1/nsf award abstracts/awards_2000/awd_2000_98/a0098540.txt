In astronomy, we commonly encounter physical conditions
              quite unfamiliar to us here on Earth. It gives us a chance to test physical
              theories that apply locally in order to see if they remain valid at extremes.
              As neutron stars, pulsars represent one such extreme. With their many unusual
              properties, pulsars can be studied in themselves but they can also be used to
              probe the interstellar medium and to investigate experimentally the effects of
              relativistic gravitation. Starting from the background and results of a current
              grant, the investigation outlined here moves on to new research in each of
              these three areas. Intrinsic studies of pulsars will include measurements of
              polarized pulse profiles, investigations of the emission beam geometry, and
              searches for free and radiative precession. The binary pulsar B1913+16 will be
              used as a relativistic gravitational laboratory. Gravitational radiation
              emission and relativistic spin precession will be measured and compared with
              theory. The interstellar medium investigations will involve Faraday rotation
              measurements of the galactic magnetic field and several pulsar
              pulse-phase-resolved spectrometry studies. The spectrometry experiments will
              include the determination of pulsar distances and interstellar electron
              densities through neutral hydrogen kinematic distance measurements.
