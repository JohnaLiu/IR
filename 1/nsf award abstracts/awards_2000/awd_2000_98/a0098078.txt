"Fault-Tolerant Distributed Resource Location"

Resource
              location is a fundamental problem in distributed computing.
Examples include
              such basic tasks as translating URLs into machine
addresses, mapping telephone
              numbers to individual telephones, and
searching for documents on the Web. 
              Typical current solutions involve
maintaining centralized directories that
              become bottlenecks that
impair speed and reliability; such solutions are also
              unsuited to
peer-to-peer systems where individual machines come and go freely.
              The
research examines how to distribute directory information
holographically
              throughout the network, so that the costs of searches
are spread evenly, no
              specialized server machines are needed, and
resources can still be found even
              if a large fraction of the machines
leave the system.

The main technique is
              the construction of random graphs whose nodes
(representing resources and
              machines) are assigned coordinates in some
space based on their keys. 
              Searching for a resource involves moving a
token from some initial node to
              adjacent nodes closer to the target
until the target is reached.  Core
              components of the project are the
design of graph structures that provide the
              correct mix of
short-distance and long-distance edges for fast searching and
              the
design of local mechanisms for building and repairing such
              structures
quickly without central coordination.
