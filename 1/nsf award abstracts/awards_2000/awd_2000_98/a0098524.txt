Abstract    :
              " Accretion Disks Around Young Massive Stars"
AST- 0098524

Massive stars are
              responsible for many of the basic characteristics of spiral galaxies. They
              effectively dictate the properties of the interstellar medium through their
              strong ionizing radiation, vigorous outflowing winds and eventual demise as
              supernovae explosions. They also influence the formation of subsequent
              generations of stars by triggering the initial collapse of cloud cores of
              molecular dust and gas. The dominant mechanism by which high mass stars form
              remains one of the outstanding problems of stellar astrophysics. Most likely,
              the mechanism is similar to that which produces low mass stars through the
              formation and collapse of protostellar disks. But, in the case of massive
              stars, there must be important modifications to the star forming process
              brought on by the enormous radiation pressure from the massive protostars. The
              possibility exists that there is an alternative route for producing stars in
              the high-mass range but first it is important to look hard for the signatures
              of disks. Through this award the PI will turn to radio astronomy and exploit
              the capabilities of the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Very Large Baseline
              Array to search for and subsequently study disks of this type. The VLA will be
              used to directly image the dust continuum emission from the accretion disk at a
              wavelength of 7 mm. The VLBA will be used to identify accretion disks in
              another way, via the strong water maser line at a wavelength of  1.3 cm and to
              use this as a kinetic probe. Whether the accretion disks are detected or not,
              the proposed observations will provide high angular resolution observations of
              matter in the vicinity of young massive stars.
