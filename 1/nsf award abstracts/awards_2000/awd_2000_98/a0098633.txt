Abstract    :
              This award supports the research of Dorian Goldfeld in the
study of discrete
              groups with applications to analytic number
theory. The proposed research
              concerns various open problems
related to: the distribution of additive
              characters on
Fuchsian groups, the ABC-conjecture, higher rank
              Eisenstein
series twisted by Ash-Borel modular symbols, the
              Waldspurger
correspondence for cubic covers of GL(2), and the
              geometric
periods associated to derivatives of L-series.


Number theory
              has its historical roots in the study of whole
numbers, and is among the
              oldest branches of mathematics. 
Diophantus, of the third century, proposed
              many problems in
his arithmetic, requiring the solutions to be whole
              numbers.
The study of integer solutions to equations is now referred
to as
              Diophantine analysis, and has many applications to
computational complexity,
              data transmission, signal
processing, cryptography, etc. Professor Goldfeld
              introduces
and studies new types of geometrical L-series (infinite sums
of
              geometric objects depending on a complex parameter) in
order to develop a
              novel general method to attack a large
class of hitherto still unsolved
              Diophantine problems.
