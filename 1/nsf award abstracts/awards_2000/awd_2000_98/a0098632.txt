This project studies several problems in which physical
              considerations motivate novel questions in chaotic dynamics. The problems
              include the investigation of chaotic scattering in higher dimensional systems,
              two-dimensional fluid turbulence with drag, and the transition of certain
              chaotic systems to bursting states. Although these problems are physically
              distinct, they are unified by their amenability to similar mathematical
              techniques.
