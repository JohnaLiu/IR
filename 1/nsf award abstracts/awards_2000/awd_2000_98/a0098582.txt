Drs. Tamas Gombosi and Michael Combi, at the University
              of Michigan, will continue a comet modeling project that is unique in that it
              addresses the full range of cometary coma phenomena with state-of-the-art
              numerical simulation codes. These investigators have experience in applying
              these codes directly to the analysis of observations.  Further development of
              the models will benefit from the rapid expansion in capabilities of computers
              and high performance algorithms enabling multi-dimensional simulation
              techniques to be applied.   The long term goal for this project is the
              development and application of a multi-scale, self-consistent comprehensive
              model of atmospheres of comets, extending from the complex 3-D nucleus to tens
              of millions of kilometers into the outer coma and tail.
