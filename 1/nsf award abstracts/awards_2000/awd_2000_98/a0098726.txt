Merline

With this award Dr. William Merline, at the Southwest
              Research Institute, will continue a program of searching for asteroid
              satellites using adaptive optics systems on a number of different telescopes. 
              An earlier program, which investigated 250 asteroids and discovered three
              asteroid satellites, contributed significantly to our understanding of
              asteroids.  The frequency and nature of such binary systems provide strong
              constraints on the satellite forming process and on the collisional evolution
              of the general asteroid population.  The satellite orbits can be used to
              directly determine asteroid masses, which combined with the asteroid diameter,
              allows determination of density, a fundamental property related to internal
              structure and composition.  The new work will obtain spectra and colors for
              individual components of the asteroid-satellite systems.  This will provide a
              critical test of the relationship between, and origin of, the components.
