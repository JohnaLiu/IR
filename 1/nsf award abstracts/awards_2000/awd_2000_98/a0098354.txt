Abstract    :
              Real-time computing is an enabling technology for many current and future
              application areas. Many future generations real-time systems are expected to be
              highly dynamic and operate in fault-prone on-deterministic environments under
              strict timing constraints.  Therefore, these systems need to be robust while
              delivering high performance. This motivates the need for robust resource
              management techniques that dynamically address real-time requirements and
              provide graceful degradation in the presence of uncertainty. Despite the
              significant body of results in resource management in real-time systems, most
              of them are based on
``open-loop'' strategies which are effective when the
              workload can be accurately modeled. These schemes are inadequate for many real
              world problems wherein the workload cannot be accurately modeled. Thus, there
              is a need for efficient architectures for resource management where predictable
              performance guarantees
can be obtained in the presence of
              uncertainty.

Feedback control theory has been central to modeling systems
              operating in uncertain environments. In the past few decades, this theory  has
              made impressive strides in this direction.  Correct adaptation as illustrated
              by feedback control theory will  yield significant dividends with respect to
              robustness.  This research focuses on developing a robust resource management
              framework for real-time systems employing feedback control
strategies.
