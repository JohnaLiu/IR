Abstract    :
              Memory management consumes a great deal of time on today's computer systems, and
              will take even longer in the future.  Software techniques have successfully
              hidden most of this overhead on personal workstations by shifting the work to
              times when the system is waiting for user
interaction.  Such techniques are
              less effective on SMP servers, where the overall computational overhead is what
              matters.  The Dynamic Memory Management Unit (DMMU), a special-purpose hardware
              mechanism based on bitmaps and combinational logic can greatly diminish this
              overhead.  Preliminary results for three languages show that this approach is
              much
faster than software memory allocation, and consumes only slightly more
              memory than software-allocation techniques. This proposal calls for the
              integration of this hardware unit into SMP systems, which would allow
              concurrent garbage collection in multithreaded-multiprocessors
environments.
              This can speed up the performance of server applications written in
              Object-Oriented languages such as C++ and Java.
