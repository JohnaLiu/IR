Over the past two decades astronomers have
              amassed a considerable body of evidence for the existence of an unseen
              component of the universe which exerts a gravitational-like influence but has
              no other identified signature. This component is known as "dark matter."  Our
              imperfect knowledge of the content and distribution of dark matter in galaxies
              is a major obstacle to our current understanding of the structure and formation
              of galaxies. This project has three parts all of which are designed to measure
              the dark matter content of different galaxies. Two of these research projects
              will attempt to quantify the amount of dark matter in spiral galaxies and the
              third will search for a possible systematic difference between the dark matter
              content of barred galaxies and of their unbarred counterparts. These projects
              involve numerical computer computations of galaxy models taking into account
              both gravitationally induced "particle" motion as well as adiabatic compression
              of dark matter halos as gas cools and settles into pre-existing potential
              wells. One final result of this program is the elaboration of a mechanism for
              the origin of bars in galaxies, a topic which has been given renewed urgency by
              recent observational and theoretical developments. Funding for this project was
              provided by the NSF program for Extragalactic Astronomy & Cosmology
              (AST/EXC).
