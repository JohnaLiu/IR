The chemical elements are the building blocks of all
              matter.  Hydrogen and helium were formed in the Big Bang, but heavier elements
              were produced by stars during the evolution of our galaxy and others. This
              enrichment is essential for the formation of planets and the development of
              life.  The process of chemical enrichment by dying stars has a random
              character, and fluctuations in the abundance of chemical elements occur from
              one place to the next.  Observations
of abundance differences among stars and
              interstellar gas clouds are becoming available, but there has been relatively
              little theoretical effort to interpret them.  This work will examine the
              evidence for abundance fluctuations in galaxies and the early universe and
              their interpretation in terms of nuclear fusion in stars, mixing processes in
              the interstellar gas, and the motions of stars through the Milky Way.
