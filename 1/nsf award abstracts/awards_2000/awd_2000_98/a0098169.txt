The
              award comprises two projects concerning shape reconstruction from real-world
              data.

The first is to work on automating the process of finding a
              conformation of a molecular model to match an electron density map produced by
              X-ray diffraction. This is a important problem in protein biochemistry,
              currently solved by laborious user interaction. Our recent research on the
              construction of the medial axis should be useful for building a concise
              encoding of the shape of the density map, which we can search for features to
              match to the molecular model.

The second project is to adapt a
              two-dimensional image processing technique to produce a high-resolution
              three-dimensional model of an object by combining many low-resolution point
              sets cap-tured by a laser range scanner. This would allow the automatic
              construction of very high-resolution models of real objects, for applications
              such as customized medical appliances. The key to adapting the technology will
              be developing a computational model of the scanner itself, a very
              non-traditional imaging device.
