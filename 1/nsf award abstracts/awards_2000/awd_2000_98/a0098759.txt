Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for research at the University of Minnesota
              Duluth (UMD) to study neutrino oscillations using the MINOS (Main Injector
              Neutrino Oscillation Search) detectors at Fermilab and Soudan, and the
              Super-Kamiokande detector in Japan, under the NSF Research at Undergraduate
              Institutions (RUI) program.  Recent results from Super-K have used neutrinos
              produced in cosmic ray interactions with the upper atmosphere to strongly
              suggest that muon neutrinos of energies from a few hundred MeV to a few hundred
              GeV oscillate to tau neutrinos as they travel the tens of thousands of
              kilometers through the earth to the detector.  This would imply that neutrinos
              carry non-zero mass.  The MINOS experiment is currently being constructed both
              to unambiguously confirm this result and to measure precisely the oscillation
              parameters using an intense well-calibrated man-made beam of neutrinos
              generated at Fermilab.  The neutrinos will be observed by similar detectors
              near their origin in Fermilab and after travelling the 730-km to the Soudan
              mine in northern Minnesota.  The differences in the signals at the two
              detectors will provide the best measurement yet of neutrino oscillation
              parameters.
	The work being proposed here is for one physicist PI and two
              undergraduate students to participate in the construction of the MINOS far
              detector and to develop part of the Detector Control System.  Additionally, the
              researchers will continue to participate in the operation of the Super-K
              detector, gathering more data to improve its statistical significance while
              improving the analysis techniques.
