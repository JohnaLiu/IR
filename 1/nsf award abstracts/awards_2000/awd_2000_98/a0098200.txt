Abstract    :
              0098200
A symposium on "Critical Issues/Questions in Nuclar Dynamics" will be
              held in San Diego, CA on 1-4 April as part of the 221st national meeting of the
              American Chemical Society.  This symposium, organized by S.J. Yennello (Texas A
              & M University) and W. Loveland (Oregon State University), features a series of
              tutorial lectures by recognized leaders in the study of nuclear reactions and
              presentations by a selected group of international experts.  Over twenty-five
              speakers from seven countries will participate.  Summary panel discussions
              involving the speakers and the audience focus on defining the critical issues
              and questions facing the field.  Among the subjects treated are fusion,
              multifragmentation, fragmentation and nuclear reaction mechanisms.  The NSF
              sponsorship will assist younger scientists and students to participate in the
              symposium.
