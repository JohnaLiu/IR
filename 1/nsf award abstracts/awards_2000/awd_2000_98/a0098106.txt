Abstract    :
              Nonperturbative methods will be developed for investigation of the structure and
              dynamics (both classical and quantum) of extended (Rydberg) atoms in static and
              time-dependent external fields.  One approach will be to study Rydberg hydrogen
              atoms in polarized fields.  A second approach will involve developing a new
              time-dependent density functional theory and applying it to the structure and
              dynamics of complex Rydberg atoms in external fields.
