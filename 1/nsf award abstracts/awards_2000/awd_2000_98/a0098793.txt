Abstract    :
              The Stony Brook Superconducting LINAC is a low-energy heavy ion
accelerator
              with a broadly based research program that studies
special properties of
              nuclei and atoms.  The research emphasizes
frontier issues in physics.  The
              rare element, francium, has been
produced and trapped with lasers, and work is
              now going on to
measure the anapole moments of several francium nuclei.  The
              anapole
moment arises from the weak interactions between neutrons and
protons
              in the nucleus.  Other research focuses on unusual nuclei
that exhibit a
              "handedness" to their structure, and nuclei that are
stressed by large
              excitation energy, large amounts of angular
momentum or large difference in
              neutrons from that of stable
nuclei.  The Stony Brook Nuclear Structure
              Laboratory also serves as
a focus of many educational activities.  Students at
              the high
school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels
              participate
in the research program with various intensities, from beam
              line
construction to running actual experiments.
