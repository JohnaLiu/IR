The Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) is operated as a
              national facility for astronomical research .  Located on Mauna Kea, Hawaii,
              the IRTF is operated by the University of Hawaii with funding from NASA.  The
              NASA  contract to the U. of Hawaii provides for supporting costs of visiting
              observers studying solar system objects.  The NSF funding supports visiting
              observers for observations of non-solar-system objects, which are allotted
              approximately 50% of the observing time on the telescope.
