During the course of this award
              the physical characteristics of young, recently formed stars will be studied by
              detecting and modeling those stars that form eclipsing binary systems. Through
              the distribution of rotational velocities among stars in two star clusters of
              different ages, an attempt will be made to understand the angular momentum loss
              mechanisms which are effective in the early evolution of single and binary
              stars. The two star clusters to be studies in detail are the Orion Nebula
              cluster, with age about 1 million years and the 100 million year old cluster
              NGC 2516. The main objective of this research is to investigate whether the
              presently understood mechanisms of stellar angular momentum evolution can
              change the rotation period distribution within the younger cluster into that
              observed in the older cluster.
