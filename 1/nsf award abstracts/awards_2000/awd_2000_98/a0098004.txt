Abstract    :
              The Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division supports this award to
              University of Notre Dame to develop an understanding of redox potentials,
              oxidation states and reactivity of elements from Groups 12 to 15, and these
              groups include metallic, semimetallic or semi-conducting elements.  The focus
              of the research will be solution and solid state chemistry based synthesis of
              homo- and hetero-atomic anion clusters, and to study the bonding of main group
              anion clusters based on germanium or Group III-V compounds.  A number of
              neutral nanoparticles or semiconducting thin films will be synthesized, and
              reactions to produce polymeric materials with extended structures of linked
              clusters will be studied by Prof. Slavi Sevov with this award.


With this
              award, negative oxidation states of elements from Groups 12 to 15 such as
              indium, bismuth, tin, gallium and other related elements will be studied with
              respect to their bonding, structures, coordination and reactivity of homo- and
              hetero-atomic anion clusters.  Both solution chemistry and solid state
              chemistry will be followed to synthesize extended structures with linked
              clusters.
