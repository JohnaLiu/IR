Abstract    :
              Elementary particle physics research is at the verge of a major
revolution,
              owing to new data and new theoretical ideas.  A broad program
of research in
              theoretical elementary particle physics will be conducted,
with the aim of
              trying to understand the origin of spacetime and of
matter, the masses of the
              elementary particles, and the forces acting on
these particles.  The
              possibility of spatial dimensions beyond the three
we have already observed
              will be considered. New insights into the origin
of matter though new
              experimental results on particles containing the
"beauty" quark and on
              neutrinos will be explored.  The connections between
superstring theory (the
              only candidate for a theory of all the basic
forces, including gravity) to
              experimentally accessible processes will be
investigated. So too will be the
              basic structure of quantum field theory.
