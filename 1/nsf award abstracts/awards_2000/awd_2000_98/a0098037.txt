Concurrent systems such as network
              protocols and net-centric programs
are difficult to build and debug because of
              the potential they exhibit
for unintended process interactions.  The
              development of net-based
applications which have to contend with probabilistic
              guarantees from
lower-levels is even more difficult as they need to be
              functionally
correct and also satisfy reliability/performance constraints. 
              This
project will investigate how formal methods can be extended to
              address
both logical correctness and reliability/performance
              constraints.

The current project will explore semantic theories of systems
              that
have both non-determinism and probabilistic choice.  In
              particular,
notions of equality and approximate equality of system behaviors
              will
be investigated.  Furthermore, the effect of these notions
              on
compositional reasoning will also be studied.

The second topic of the
              proposed work will be a thorough comparison of
the semantic theories developed
              in this project against traditional
approaches to dealing with non-determinism
              and probabilistic choice.

Finally, practical algorithms for process
              minimization and for
checking equality (and approximate equality) of processes
              will be
designed and implemented in the Concurrency Workbench of New
              Century.
Case studies, to evaluate the proposed theories, will also
              be
constructed and studied.
