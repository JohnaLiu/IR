Abstract    :
              A broad research program in theoretical physics will include
the study of
              superstring theory, particle astrophysics, the
application of field theory to
              complex physical problems,
neutrino masses and oscillations, the development
              of chaos
in quantum systems, and the numerical investigation of
              quantum
chromodynamics. Superstring theory is the exciting candidate
for a
              theory of all the fundamental forces, including gravity;
particle astrophysics
              addresses problems associated with the
very early development of the universe;
              and quantum chromodynamics
is the fundamental theory of the strong nuclear
              forces. Thus,
the investigations to be undertaken are of fundamental
              importance.
