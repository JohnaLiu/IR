There is a renewed interest in cosmology with the evidence that
              supernovae, when used as distance indicators, may point to a finite
              cosmological constant and an accelerating expansion of the universe. In
              addition, there has been a recent link between a supernova and a gamma-ray
              burst. Understanding the different types of supernovae has thus become more
              important than ever before. In this award, three major themes concerning the
              observation and theory of supernovae will be pursued. The first is to
              understand better Type Ia supernovae and their application to measure
              cosmological distances. This will involve observations with the Hobby-Eberly
              telescope and infrared spectra obtained at other observatories. The second
              theme is to explore the polarization of supernovae and its implications about
              the asymmetry of supernova outbursts. The third major undertaking will be to
              construct theoretical models of the magnetohydrodynamic processes involved in
              core collapse that may produce jets and asymmetries of the sort observed.
