This award to University of Minnesota Duluth provides
              instrumentation to significantly improve the Great Lakes research capabilities
              of the institution and the research vessel Blue Heron, a ship operated by the
              Large Lakes Observatory of UMD as part of the University-National Oceanographic
              Laboratory System research fleet.  The optical plankton counter, water sampling
              bottles and zoological sampling nets supported here will significantly enhance
              capabilities for biological and environmental studies in Lake Superior, and the
              antennas for the GPS units will allow more precise vessel motion correction,
              important for a variety of instruments.  These improvements will be of
              substantial advantage to scientists using Blue Heron in their research during
              2001 and future years.
