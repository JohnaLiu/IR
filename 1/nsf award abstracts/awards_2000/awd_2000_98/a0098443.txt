Abstract    :
              The proposed work focuses on human-robot interaction, namely on the robot
              physically sensing the human hand. Specifically, the PIs will study the
              microstructure (texture) of the contact surfaces between a robot and a human
              hand, to infer the perceptual dimensionality of haptic texture sensing
              (perceptual model), and establish the mapping of relevant spaces. Methods for
              producing intuitive and efficient synthetic textures will be investigated.
              Rendering algorithms will be developed for synthesizing textures with desired
              perceptual qualities. The work is expected to contribute to various areas of
              haptic perception, texture studies, and multimodal rendering of information.
