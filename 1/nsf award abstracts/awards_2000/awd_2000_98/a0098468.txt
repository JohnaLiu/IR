Spectacular advances have been made recently in our knowledge of
              brown dwarfs and other objects near the substellar limit. The foundation of the
              program is the continued use of the Keck telescopes and their various
              instruments. Work carried out under this award will build on and expand upon
              the pioneering work which has been done during the last few years. Four goals
              are outlined. (1) To understand the binary frequency among low-mass objects and
              to investigate the orbital characteristics of binary stars. Observations will
              include echelle spectroscopy in the optical and infrared to look for radial
              velocities. Adaptive optics will be utilized to search for sub-arcsecond
              companions of known low-mass stars. (2) To test the extension of the substellar
              mass function down to the boundary between brown dwarfs and planets. This will
              be done with low-resolution spectra, principally to test for the presence of
              lithium. (3) Analysis of atomic and molecular line profiles in the optical and
              near infrared will yield information about the physical conditions within very
              cool stellar atmospheres. (4) An effort to understand what happens to the
              stellar magnetic activity at the low-luminosity, low-mass end of the main
              sequence. It is suspected that normal stellar activity, similar to that which
              we observe in the sun, is greatly diminished in these stars. The observations
              will be supplemented by state-of-the-art theoretical modeling of the stellar
              atmospheres with special attention to dust opacity and partial element
              depletions.
