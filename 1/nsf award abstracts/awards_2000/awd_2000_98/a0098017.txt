Abstract    :
              Distributed real-time systems are often very complex.  They are composed of
              heterogeneous systems intended to perform tasks subject to many constraints,
              including time constraints in the face of dynamic environmental changes.  In
              order to meet these challenges, a unifying, extensible, compiler-based
              framework is proposed for the design and engineering of complex real-time
              systems, with the following research objectives:

- To devise a systems
              engineering framework that includes a systems specification language and
              multiple problem-solving approaches, as well as an automated mapping between
              them.

- To discover common properties of extant on-line performance
              visualization tools for parallel and distributed, heterogeneous systems, as
              well as gather desired properties of the on-line performance analysis and
              visualization as a real-time middleware.  Using the findings, to devise a
              comprehensive performance and analysis framework as a basis for advanced
              extensions.

- To integrate the systems engineering and on-line performance
              and analysis frameworks in a way that facilities on-line system
              
steering/reconfiguration of complex real-time systems.  The integrated
              approach should be semi-automated, and allow algorithmic and visual analyses of
              instrumentation data received from the target system to utilize problem-solving
              tools.
