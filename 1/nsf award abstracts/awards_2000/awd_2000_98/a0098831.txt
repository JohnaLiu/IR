Abstract    :
              Professor Murray Johnston of the University of Delaware is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry and Atmospheric Chemistry Programs for his
              research on chemical characterization of ultrafine aerosol particles.  The work
              will develop a new analytical approach for ultrafine particle analysis,
              particularly those smaller than 10 nm. Laser desorption photoionization of
              aerosols collected on a plate will be demonstrated with aerosols in the 20-50
              nm range. Ultimately, ambient aerosols in 5 nm range will be studied. The
              results will be compared to single particle analysis where possible.  

The
              characterization of aerosols and study of their formation and growth is an
              unsolved problem in condensed phase chemistry and atmospheric science.
              Understanding aerosols is key to accurate modeling of the atmosphere and
              prediction of global climate change.  It is also important to study
              nanodroplets for their implications on health.  Ultrafine particles are more
              harmful to breathe because they penetrate deeper into the lungs.
