Abstract    :
              Complex ULSI designs will be plagued by a myriad of interconnects problems that
              could require many design iterations to meet timing, power, area, and noise
              specifications. To cope with this interconnect dilemma, the current
              transistor-centric VLSI design flow must evolve into an interconnect-centric
              design flow; however, for this design flow to develop it must accurately
              predict the impact of interconnects on the performance of logic megacells at
              the earliest stages of design. This research effort is focused on developing an
              accurate prediction of the length of each net in a given netlist during logic
              design. The novel aspect of this work is that a stochastic wire length
              distribution model, which has been developed in part by the principal
              investigator, is being used to aid in this prediction. In addition, prediction
              methodologies that give the designer the ability to choose from a set of
              possible wiring configurations is emphasized. An integral part of this
              prediction methodology is the incorporation of the wire length predictions into
              length prediction driven placement algorithms. The significance of this
              proposed research is that highly accurate wire length predictions could
              substantially enhance the accuracy of early timing analysis and give the
              designer greater flexibility in finding solutions to overcome impending
              interconnect limits.
