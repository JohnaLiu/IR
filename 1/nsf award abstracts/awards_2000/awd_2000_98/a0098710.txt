Abstract    :
              
This research program will offer a general framework for understanding
              synchronization in coupled nonlinear systems with different characters and/or
              different parameter values.  The methods developed for analysis of phase and
              generalized synchronization will be used to understand complex behavior in
              general, and in particular to understand synchronicity in neuroscience.
