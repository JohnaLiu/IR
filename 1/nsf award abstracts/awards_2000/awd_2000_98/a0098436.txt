Observations of neutron stars are a principal way of
              investigating the properties of ultra-high density matter at densities several
              times that of the atomic nucleus. This research program of Dr. Cole Miller, at
              the University of Maryland, is directed towards a careful analysis of timing
              and spectral data from the brightness oscillations seen during X-ray bursts,
              The ultimate aims of the project are to constrain the equation of state and to
              understand thermonuclear propagation in neutron stars. Observations made with
              the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite, the Chandra X-ray Observatory and
              the European X-ray Multi-Mirror satellite will be analyzed during the course of
              the project.
