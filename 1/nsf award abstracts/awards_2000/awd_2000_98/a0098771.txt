Abstract    :
              This research proposal will utilize a multi-disciplinary approach using
              principles of statistics and physics to identify statistical characteristics of
              scientific and technology (S&T) systems.  Variables will include scientific
              field, level of aggregation, and international comparisons.  Data used will
              include R&D funding and personnel, including NSF sources, patents, and
              publications.  The PIs will examine issues such as if the level of aggregation
              or funding level is critical for scientific productivity.
