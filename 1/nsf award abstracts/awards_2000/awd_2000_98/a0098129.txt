Abstract    :
              This work will continue studies in nonlinear optics with bosons (nonclassical
              fields, confined geometries) and now also consider nonlinear optics with
              fermionic fields.  Topics for bosons will include the generation of squeezed
              matter-wave fields, entangled optical and matter-wave fields, and instabilities
              resulting from wave mixing, as well as the possibilities and challenges
              associated with reduced dimensionality.  Potential applications of fermionic
              fields include fermionic atom lasers and sources of atoms on demand.
