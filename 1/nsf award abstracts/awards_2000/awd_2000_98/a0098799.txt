Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for the collider physics research program of the
              University of Nebraska.  The primary focus is the D0 experiment at Fermilab. 
              With leading roles in the continued analysis of existing Run I data (collected
              between 1992 and 1996) and in the D0 upgrade for Run II starting in March 2001,
              this group focuses on physics studies in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and
              searches for new particles.  Recent accomplishments (also a Nebraska PhD
              thesis) include a search for a supersymmetric partner to the top quark using
              the full Run I data set.  For Run II, this group has built electronics for the
              new Level-2 muon trigger.
	The CMS experiment, currently under construction
              for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Geneva
              Switzerland, will be the next major experiment for the University of Nebraska
              group.  On CMS, this group has the responsibility to coordinate the measurement
              of the pp luminosity.  On analysis, this group will extend its work on D0 by
              concentrating on new particle searches and QCD studies exploiting the enhanced
              physics reach of the 14 TeV LHC.  Lastly, the PI's are very heavily involved in
              undergraduate and graduate education projects as well as in novel outreach
              programs such as the separately-funded NSF-sponsored CROP program.
