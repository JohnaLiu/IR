Abstract    :
              This proposal requests support for the research program of the Wayne State group
              which is involved in the CLEO experiment at the CESR facility at Cornell
              University and in the BTeV experiment currently planned for future running at
              the Fermilab Tevatron collider.  This group participated actively in the
              physics analysis of CLEO II (the PI was co-spokesman for a term), made major
              contributions to the interaction region (IR) for the upgrade of CESR and CLEO,
              and helped with the new RICH particle identification detector.  The group is
              currently working on interesting physics results with CLEO II data including
              D-mixing, the D-star width, rare semileptonic DS decays, the mass of the tau
              neutrino, B to tau nu, and accelerator physics.
For BTeV the group plans to
              bring its expertise in the construction of low mass and high precision
              machine-detector interfaces to this project.  The physics interests include
              rare charm decays where no work beyond very promising early calculations have
              thus far been done.  The proposed BTeV detector looks to be very sensitive to
              D-mixing.  BTeV will become the group's main physics interest after the
              completion of CLEO.
