Abstract    :
              This project supports a research conference and competition for undergraduate
              and masters level graduate students who are conducting research with faculty
              members from the disciplines of Anthropology, History, Political Science,
              Psychology, and Sociology. In a variety of ways, the conference encourages
              undergraduate students to enter graduate school and encourage masters level
              graduate students to continue.  First, it helps give them the motivation and
              opportunity to participate in the kind of research with faculty mentors that
              they would do in graduate school.  Second, it exposes them to other students
              involved in research, and possibly interested in continuing their education. 
              Third, it brings in outside speakers to discuss the values and rewards
              associated with the research process, and an invited plenary speaker to further
              address the topic of minority students in graduate education.  Fourth, it makes
              awards of $500, $250, and $100 for the top three places in the undergraduate
              and graduate competition.  

The conference expands on previously smaller
              conferences that proved successful in getting participating students to apply
              to graduate school.  It recruits student participants from the South Texas
              region, hoping in particular to attract minority and first-generation college
              students, and to enhance their motivation and competitiveness in being accepted
              into graduate programs and in seeking leadership roles in diverse
              professions.
