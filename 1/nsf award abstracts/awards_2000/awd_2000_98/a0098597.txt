During the period of the award, a new set of
              magnetic field diagnostics for dilute astrophysical plasmas will be developed
              and predictions made which can be followed up observationally. These effects
              manifest themselves in the polarization of light which has been scattered from
              the magnetized volumes. Fluorescent scattering of light by atoms causes an
              observable linear polarization of spectral lines which depends on
              well-established atomic physics. The new diagnostics could yield the first-ever
              measurements of magnetic fields in circumstellar envelopes and thus be
              invaluable to investigations of phenomena involving star-wind coupling with the
              interstellar medium, comet comae, cool star envelopes and hot stellar winds.
              The proposed work involves (a) the development of the theory of atomic
              alignment, (b) new atomic physics calculations for ions of astrophysical
              interest, and (c) an exploration of the regime where both alignment and
              polarization effects apply. Broader impacts of the work include the development
              of cross-disciplinary ties between the solar and stellar physics communities
              and the development of a potential new diagnostic for dilute plasmas.
