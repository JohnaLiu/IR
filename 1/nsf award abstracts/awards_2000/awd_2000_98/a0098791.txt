Abstract    :
              A two-pronged program in theoretical elementary particle physics and
cosmology
              will study the source of mass for elementary particles and the
source of
              energy which now dominates the universe. For the former, studies
will be made
              to determine how data from high-energy collider facilities
can be used to
              unravel the way in which the Higgs boson interacts with
matter. From this we
              will learn whether there is more than one Higgs boson
and how the Higgs
              boson(s) generate masses for other particles. On the
latter front, there is
              mounting evidence that most of the energy in the
universe has a unique and
              unknown form. Models will be built to explain
this data and will be tested
              against the growing body of data. The twin
questions of what gives particles
              their mass and what gives the universe
its mass are fundmentally important and
              will be at the center of
theoretical and experimental work for the coming
              decade.
