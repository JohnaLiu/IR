Abstract    :
              
"Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) was first developed in 1977 as a way
              to
directly measure the ratio of radiocarbon (carbon-14) to stable
              carbon
(carbon-12) in organic material and thus to determine when the organism
              died
using samples of a milligram or less.  For reasons that are not
              completely
understood the technique is presently limited to samples that are
              60,000
years old or younger.  Even for samples, e.g. carbon from oil, natural
              gas
(methane) or coal, that are millions of years old this limit applies. 
              It
thus prevents the dating of very old samples.  It also prevents
              the
selection of sources of natural gas for use in the production of very
              large
volume liquid scintillation detectors for the measurement of low
              energy
neutrinos.  The measurement of these and higher energy neutrinos from
              the
sun is presently an important scientific endeavor.  One would like to
              find
sources of methane that have carbon-14 to stable carbon ratios
              corresponding
to 110,000 years, or, perhaps, even to 150,000 years from
              which
scintillation liquid can be manufactured to allow the measurement of
              the
lowest energy solar neutrinos.  The proposed research has the aim
              of
measuring such ages of methane and other organic material by AMS."
