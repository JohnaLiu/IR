Abstract    :
              This proposal will investigate the structure of atomic nuclei at the extremes of
              stability, angular momentum, and energy.  The studies will include nuclear
              systems beyond the proton drip line and at the
limits of stability to fission.
              Techniques will be developed to study light-ion transfer reactions on nuclei
              far from stability using radioactive ion beams.  This proposal also addresses,
              via measurements of magnetic moments of excited states,  the the microscopic
              description of nuclear wavefunctions as a function of energy and spin, the
              study of residual nucleon-nucleon interactions, and the interplay of single
              particle configurations with an underlying spherical or deformed core.  A new
              technique, combining the traditional transient field method with the newly
              developed approach involving Coulomb excitation of {\it beams} in inverse
              kinematics, will be explored in order to measure magnetic moments of excited
              states with
subpicosecond lifetimes in nuclei close to shell closure.  The
              structure of the proposed activities is designed to have great impact on the
              education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as
              postdoctoral associates involved with these experimental research
              activities.
