Abstract    :
              The annual IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, sponsored
              by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, has become the largest annual
              conference in robotics and automation worldwide, and serves as a key forum
              where international researchers gather to exchange ideas on emerging
              technologies as well as technical problems and their solutions.  It is
              important that the U.S. be well-represented at each of these conferences, which
              unfortunately are often held in places to which it is difficult for some of our
              best researchers to travel due to the cost involved.  The purpose of this
              funding is to bolster U.S. participation at ICRA'01 by helping U.S. researchers
              who could not otherwise afford to attend the conference.   The availability of
              NSF travel assistance will be announced in the IEEE Robotics and Automation
              Society Magazine as well as on the web site of ICRA'01.   A 4-member selection
              committee will be formed by the conference organizers to screen applicants
              according to a set of criteria, such as:  the applicant's technical area of
              interest;  the expected impact of conference participation on the applicant's
              professional development;  the opportunities for planned visits, talks, and
              interactions by the applicant before, during, and/or after the conference;  and
              any other sources of funding available to the applicant to help defray the cost
              of attending.  With this funding we hope to have a strong U.S. presence at
              ICRA'2001.
