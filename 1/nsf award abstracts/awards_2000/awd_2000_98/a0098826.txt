Abstract    :
              This project has the following components:

1) the US ATLAS detector
              construction project at the LHC, a 7 TeV on 7 TeV proton-proton collider under
              construction at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. This machine and
              its detectors will define the next energy frontier;

2) the D0 experiment now
              undergoing a major upgrade at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory
              (Fermilab), a 1.8 TeV proton-antiproton collider, an experiment at the current
              energy frontier;

3)the ZEUS experiment, at the electron-proton collider at
              DESY in Hamburg, Germany, which probes the structure of the proton with the
              world's highest energy electron microscope;

4) the NuTeV experiment, that
              has successfully used a new neutrino beam at Fermilab, to probe the nucleon
              structure in a manner complementary to electrons;

5) the MiniBoone
              construction project at Fermilab, which can provide new information on neutrino
              mass;

6) the HiRes cosmic ray detector project in Dugway, Utah, which will
              detect cosmic rays at the highest energies yet seen in nature.
 
7) an
              innovative "e-bubble"  project, which also includes a new education-outreach
              component through Quarknet. 

These activities are supported by the
              facilities of Columbia's Nevis Laboratories.
