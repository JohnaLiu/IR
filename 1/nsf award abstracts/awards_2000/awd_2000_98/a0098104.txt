Abstract    :
              The proposed research aims to explore several fundamental issues of
              orientation-induced crystallization in polymers.  These issues include: (1) the
              mechanism of initial stages of crystallization in oriented chains, (2) the
              overall kinetics of crystallization from the system containing chains of
              varying degrees of orientation, (3) the effects of molecular weight, molecular
              weight distribution, chain architecture and chain branching on
              orientation-induced crystallization, (4) the influence of molecularly dispersed
              nanostructured molecules on the chain orientation, and (5) the resultant
              morphology consisting of oriented crystal, oriented mesomorphic and unoriented
              amorphous phases.  To accomplish these goals, it is proposed to carry out four
              research projects including: (a) the weak shear-flow study under step-shear and
              steady-state shear conditions, (b) the strong elongation-flow study, (c) the
              study of the effect of molecularly dispersed nanostructured molecules in
              polymers, and (d) the study of crystallization in oriented polymers using
              supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) as a mean to control molecular orientation. 
              The planned experiments will include the use of combined methods of rheology, a
              high-pressure apparatus, in-situ optical (light scattering, birefringence and
              Raman spectroscopy) and x-ray (small- and wide-angle x-ray scattering with
              synchrotron radiation) techniques and ex-situ microscopic techniques.

The
              significance of the research lays in the fact that orientation-induced
              crystallization remains one of the most important problems in polymer
              processing today, and the subject is not fully understood.  It is hoped that
              with the proposed study, an in-depth understanding about the subject can be
              obtained, increasing the ability to correlate the structure, morphology,
              process and property relationships for crystalline polymers, thus benefiting
              the polymer industry.
