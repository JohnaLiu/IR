Campins

Dr. Humberto Campins will lead a systematic three-year
              study of Centaurs, Transneptunian Objects (TNOs), and inactive nuclei of
              Jupiter-family (JF) comets.  He will obtain near-infrared spectra as a function
              of rotational phase for members of these three groups. The proper study of the
              spectral variability with rotational phase in a significant number of Centaurs,
              TNOs, and JF comets is essential if we are to understand the evolutionary links
              between these three populations of primitive Solar System objects.  Dr. Campins
              will observe with the new 6.5- meter MMT facility in Arizona, which will allow
              detailed observations of enough members of each population for a proper
              comparison of their properties. He has already demonstrated that one of these
              objects (8405 Asbolus) has a dramatic spectral variation as a function of
              rotational phase.
