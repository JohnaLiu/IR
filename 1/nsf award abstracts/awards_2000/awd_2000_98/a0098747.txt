Abstract    :
              	The main portion of this research project addresses fundamental
questions
              about the nature of space and time.  It is part of a broad
effort shared by
              many researchers who are building the structures we
need to understand more
              about both the beginning of our universe and what
happens at the center of
              black holes.  Some researchers believe that
these answers will lead to many
              others, and eventually to a complete
theory of physics that explains the
              detailed structure of our
universe.
	A number of specific technical questions
              will be investigated, relating
to various approaches.  Some of these develop
              mathematical tools for
the so-called `loop approach' to quantum gravity. 
              Others relate to the
possibility that our universe may have more than the
              three space and
one time dimensions that we see.  For example, this idea is
              part of the
approach known as `string theory.'   Finally, some investigations
              use
the laws of physics to place constraints on the way that space and
              time
can curve and warp.
