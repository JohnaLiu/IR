"Theoretical Studies of Cataclysmic
              Variables"
AST-0098742

Cataclysmic variable stars through their binary
              nature have long been recognized as excellent astrophysical laboratories for
              studying the behavior of matter under conditions not reproducible here on
              Earth.  Examples include accretion processes, thermonuclear runaways and the
              physics of degenerate matter. During the period of this award, the PI will
              improve our understanding of the characteristics of cataclysmic variables.
              Specifically, he is planning a systematic study of the role of common envelope
              efficiency and its effect on key features of the cataclysmic variable
              population. In particular, the formation of cataclysmic binaries with one
              component being an ONeMg white dwarf will be studied. Attention will also be
              paid to the formation of those with brown dwarf secondary stars and their
              subsequent evolution.
