Abstract    :
              Wayne State University has an REU program to bring disadvantaged students from
              the Detroit Metro Area to national laboratories over the summer. In this
              proposal we will bring six students to the LNS laboratory at Cornell University
              and four students to the BNL laboratory in Long Island, NY.  WSU provides a
              uniquely diverse group of students, largely from underrepresented segments of
              society.  The recruiting and preparation phase provides the students with
              intensive faculty interaction, encouragement, and an effort to make sure that
              the student needs are met.  The program consists of a preparation phase
              involving a one-hour course given over the winter to students and prospective
              teacher participants (14 hours total). The course introduces the students and
              teachers to the physical and mathematical concepts relevant for the summer
              experience.  The course also provides an introduction to the computing
              environment of a large experiment, and a computer homework, which requires the
              students to write and understand simple programs, produce some graphic output,
              and write their own web page within a Unix environment.  Faculties travel with
              the students to Cornell and Brookhaven in early June to help them get settled
              and started. They merge with existing REU programs at Brookhaven and Cornell
              for social activities, and lectures on various scientific topics.
