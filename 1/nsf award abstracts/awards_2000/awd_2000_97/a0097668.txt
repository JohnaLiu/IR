Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              (REU) site at the University of Kentucky, where a previous REU site was funded
              for 1997-1999.  David Atwood is the site's Program Director. Eleven faculty
              will serve as REU student mentors.  During the award period (2001-2003), each
              summer ten students will participate in a eleven-week program.  The research
              area will be nano-scale chemistry, which will include all of the major
              divisions of chemistry.  This research is multidisciplinary and is being
              conducted with a combination of collaborations involving the Engineering,
              Biological, and Geology departments.  Available to the undergraduates will be
              the research programs of other faculty outside of the nano-scale projects. 
              During the summer there will be a short-course on nanochemistry.  This program
              will target women and Appalachian students from Kentucky and neighboring
              states.  Academic year follow-up activities are planned.
