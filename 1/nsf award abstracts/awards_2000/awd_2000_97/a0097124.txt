Abstract    :
              0097124 -- Smyth/OSU

This project is a preliminary numerical investigation of
              whether Holmboe 
waves can generate appreciable mixing in idealized stratified
              flow 
configurations similar to those that might be expected in some oceanic
              
regimes such as exchange flows.  This research will examine whether a
              
significant mixing efficiency can be achieved.  A spectral model of
              a
continuously stratified flow containing a sharp density gradient and a
              
more gentle shear gradient will be used to make direct numerical
simulations
              of the growth and nonlinear development of Holmboe waves.
If numerical results
              provide evidence that the Holmboe instability leads
to effective mixing, this
              will provide an impetus for a more thorough 
investigation of the life-cycle
              of Holmboe instabilities and the 
associated mixing.
