Abstract    :
              This award provides renewed funding to support the Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) program at SUNY Stony Brook. The program annually hosts
              eight upper division undergraduate students majoring in science or engineering
              to actively participate in eight weeks of research on estuarine processes. The
              students will conduct independent research under the guidance of a faculty
              mentor. Funding for this program will be supplemented by NY State Sea Grant and
              MSRC. The proposal is based on the theory that mentoring and networking are the
              most effective methods for recruiting students into a profession and for
              training young researchers. It is well designed to encourage highly motivated
              students to continue the their pursuit of research careers in oceanography. It
              encourages interdisciplinary research by organizing the students' research
              topics around a central theme. Students conduct independent research and
              produce oral and written reports at the end of the internship. The program will
              also encourage a diverse set of students to continue their education in the
              field of oceanography. In the past the program has had more than 50% female
              participants, has drawn students from across the nation, and has attracted an
              ethnically diverse group of students.
