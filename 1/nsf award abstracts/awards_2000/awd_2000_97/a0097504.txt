Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the National Institute of Standards and
              Technology (NIST) for the support of a 5 year REU Site entitled, "SURFing the
              Building and Fire Research Laboratory: A NIST-NSF Partnership," under the
              direction of Dr. Christopher White.  This partnership will provide research
              opportunities for outstanding students to collaborate with internationally
              known NIST scientists in the fields of building materials, structure, building
              environment, and fire science and engineering.  The 8 undergraduate students
              will spend 10-12 weeks working one-on-one with NIST staff on selected projects
              that combine basic research with direct applications to problems of national
              importance.
