Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Cincinnati. 
              John Alexander is the site's Program Director; Allan Pinhas is the Co-Program
              Director. Twelve faculty will serve as REU student mentors.  During the award
              period (2001-2003), each summer ten students will participate in a ten-week
              program.  Recruitment efforts will be targeted on students east of the
              Mississippi with particular focus on a dozen HBCUs that regularly produce
              chemistry majors.  Another recruitment effort will be targeted on the city's
              nationally known college prep high school, Walnut Hills, which sends a
              significant number of talented African-American students to colleges in other
              cities and states.  Women's colleges will also be a recruiting focal point. 
              Student participants will select from projects in analytical, inorganic,
              organic and physical chemistry.  Each student will work closely with a faculty
              mentor on a research problem.  There will be weekly luncheons/seminars for all
              student participants and faculty mentors.  The program will conclude with a
              student poster symposium.  Each student will also be required to write a
              project report. In terms of assessment, a two-page feedback questionnaire will
              be completed at the end of the program, and there will be follow-up
              communications during the following academic year.
