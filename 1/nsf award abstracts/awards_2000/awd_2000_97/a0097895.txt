Landolt

The goal of Dr. Arlo Landolt's astronomical
              observational research project is to enhance, develop, and publish faint
              standard star sequences which are needed for a variety of scientific purposes. 
              There occur projected against the celestial sphere a wide range of phenomena
              for which observers need intensity and color information.  Therefore, there is
              a long-term need for accurate photometric standard stars, those with known
              intensities and colors at a variety of optical wavelengths.  Use of such
              standard stars permits the combination and inter-comparison of the brightness
              and color measurements of different celestial phenomena made by different
              investigators.  Furthermore, Dr. Landolt's standard star work will be an
              important step toward solving the calibration problems facing the new
              generation of giant telescopes.
