Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Utah.  Richard
              Steiner is the site's Program Director.  Ten faculty will serve as REU student
              mentors.  During the award period (2001-2003), 10 students will be supported
              each summer in a ten-week program.  Recruitment efforts will target students
              who do not have substantial research opportunities at there own institutions. 
              In addition, the program will seek to attract a mix of students representing
              rural and urban upbringing and will focus on females and ethnic minorities. The
              research projects offered are in the areas of analytical, inorganic, organic,
              and physical chemistry.   Throughout the program, emphasis will be placed on
              students learning how to work independently on a project while also learning
              the importance of scientific interactions and teamwork.  At the program's
              conclusion the students will give oral reports, participate in a poster
              session, and submit s final written report.  Program evaluation will include a
              Likert scale questionnaire for the student participants, and correspondence
              with the student participants during the academic year immediately following
              the research experience.
