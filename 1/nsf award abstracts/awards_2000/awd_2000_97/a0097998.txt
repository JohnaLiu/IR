Abstract    :
              Conventional solutions for I/O have attempted to provide hardware
and software
              parallelism via RAIDs or parallel machines/supercomputers.
However, the
              problems associated with cost, scalability, 
and/or accessibility of these
              environments make them unattractive 
for widespread usage. This research
              addresses this important
deficiency in high-performance I/O support, by
              proposing a shared storage
system using an off-the-shelf cluster of
              workstations, disks, and
networks. The proposed research goes beyond current
              state-of-the-art in I/O 
support for clusters and examines a broad spectrum
              of
issues related to I/O software on clusters, that
              include
application-directed, compiler-directed, and runtime system-directed
              
optimizations. These optimizations are crucial to reduce/hide the 
latencies
              to different levels of the I/O hierarchy which will help 
accelerate the
              deployment of clusters for I/O-intensive applications.
