Abstract    :
              The features of the Maria Mitchell Observatory (MMO) REU site are the student
              participation in guided research in astronomy and astrophysics (star formation,
              circumstellar disks, turbulence, comets, variable stars) along with intense
              involvement in public outreach in astronomy and features students immersion
              under dedicated professional supervison in research from project selection
              through the preparation of talks and publications.  On-campus living
              arrangements ensure collegial team building and research experience.  The MMO
              possesses a unique photographic archive and an 8-inch telescope with CCD
              detector for routine observations.  It also has guaranteed time on the 31-inch
              NURO telescope at Flagstaff, Arizona.  during the past several years, observing
              time for student research projects has also been obtained on large national
              astronomical facilities.  Each REU student participates in these projects. 
              During the last four years, every student has presented a paper at an American
              Astronomical Society meeting or at other national and international meetings. 
              Every student co-authors a paper in a respected peer-reviewed journal
