Abstract    :
              The University of New Mexico operates a Research Experience for Undergraduates
              (REU) Site on the synthesis and processing of advanced materials.  Faculty with
              chemical engineering, chemistry, materials science and ceramic backgrounds
              serve as student mentors.  Several projects involve participation from
              scientists at Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories. The REU Site is
              affiliated with the Center for Microengineered materials, an
              industry-university cooperative research center at the University of New
              Mexico.  Projects offered to undergraduates include research on the sol-gel
              synthesis of nanostructures, nanoparticle systems, and thin films and
              interfaces. Twelve students are recruited every year for a ten-week summer
              research experience.
