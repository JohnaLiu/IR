Abstract    :
              The main goal of this three-year project is to develop a truly interdisciplinary
              ten-week undergraduate summer research program at The University of South
              Dakota (USD) that takes advantage of unique regional resources. Eight students
              will be selected to conduct research in NSF-eligible areas and will join four
              additional students in other, non-science  fields with funding from USD. The
              overall program consists of three major components: (i) the research itself,
              including projects in a number of disciplines from a
variety of departments,
              such as Biology, Chemistry, Psychology, and Archaeology; (ii) social and
              educational events, which rely upon the excellent and unique opportunities for
              outdoor activities associated with the river and surrounding areas; (iii)
              communication of research results, including the weekly Lewis and Clark Hour
              sessions with participation of the program director, students and research
              mentors, and student presentations at the National Conference on Undergraduate
              Research (NCUR) and the USD annual undergraduate research conference, IdeaFest.
              This program provides a mechanism to expand the undergraduate research culture
              across campus and to more completely integrate student scholarship into
              undergraduate education. In an effort to provide research experiences to
              talented undergraduate students from other campuses in the state, USD will
              expand involvement to include students from smaller colleges and universities
              in the state and region and from South Dakota's two tribal colleges.
