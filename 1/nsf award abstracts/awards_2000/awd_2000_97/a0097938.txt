Abstract    :
              This project is focused on designing solid state chemical strategies that will
              produce tailor-made porous crystals. Synthetic and host-guest chemistry of new
              compositions will be developed to advance porous materials research with the
              following emphasis: (a) frameworks combining porosity with semi-,
              photo-conductive, and nonlinear optical properties, (b) synthesis of
              extra-large pore (defined: 10-20 A diameter) frameworks,which will be useful in
              the separation and catalytic conversion of bio-related molecules
              (pharmaceuticals) and large petrolewn fractions, and (c) confined molecular
              space of unusual composition and electrostatic potential capable of hosting the
              assembly of active molecular complexes and clusters. Because the nature of this
              project involves both solution chemistry and solid-state chemistry, it provides
              a rare opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students to experience and
              become experts in the synthesis, characterization and properties of materials
              in both arenas. 

Porous materials based on carbon and oxide compositions
              have found wide-spread applications in sensing, gas separation, catalysis,
              environirnental cleanup (water purification and radioactive ion removal),
              nanotechnology, and more recently in hydrogen and methane storage and
              transport. For example, the enormous importance of zeolitic silicates and
              aluminosilicates as shape- and size-selective adsorbents, ion- exchangers and
              catalysts is reflected by their 350 billion US dollar sector of the global
              economy. The interdisciplinary nature of this research is ideally suited for
              training students in areas that are becoming increasingly critical to the US
              ability to maintain its leadership in global industries.
