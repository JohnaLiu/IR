This grant continues Research at Undergraduate Institution
              (RUI) support for a theoretical study of the interesting and unusual behavior
              of a series of strongly correlated electron systems: elemental plutonium, its
              alloys, and the isostructural monopnictides and monochalcogenides of cerium and
              uranium; and, the electronic and magnetic properties of the one-and
              two-dimensional periodic Anderson hamiltonian.
