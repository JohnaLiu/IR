Abstract    :
              The six participating students will conduct independent research under the
              supervision of Professor Arie Bialostocki with the assistance of David
              Grynkiewicz, a former REU participant.  The topics of research are:  Erdos-type
              problems ranging from extremal graph theory, number theory to combinatorial
              geometry and problems in finite groups, in particular permutation puzzles. 
              Additional aspects of the program are enhancing the mathematical writing and
              presentation skills of the participant and the exploration of a variety of
              careers in mathematics, especially choosing a graduate school.  On the lighter
              side of the program there will be recreational activities like socializing,
              hiking, movies, plays and concerts.  Each participating student will receive a
              stipend of $3,200 and free single room housing on campus.  More details appear
