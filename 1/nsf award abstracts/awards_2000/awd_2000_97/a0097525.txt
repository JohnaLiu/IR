Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Connecticut. 
              Amy Howell is the site's Program Director; Christian Bruckner is the Co-Program
              Director. Twelve faculty will serve as REU student mentors.  During the award
              period (2001-2003), each summer students will participate in a ten-week
              program.  Plans are to recruit students within the region (New England, NY, NJ,
              PA) from institutions that have limited opportunities for independent research.
               A concerted effort will be made to recruit students with physical
              disabilities--the department has the capability to provide bench chemistry for
              students who use wheel chairs. The research projects offered are in the areas
              of analytical, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry.  Student
              participants will interact extensively with their faulty research mentor and
              senior graduate student.  The program will include a seminar series featuring
              safety, presenting research results, ethical issues in science, careers in
              chemistry, and use of chemical databases.  The program will conclude with oral
              presentations and a poster symposium, which will be held in conjunction with
              other REU programs on campus.  The program will be evaluated by the students
              via a series of questionnaires, first when they arrive on campus and again upon
              their departure.  The REU faculty will be surveyed at the conclusion of each
              program, as will the faculty at the students' home institutions.  Students will
              be tracked in terms of their professional activities following their
              participation in the program.
