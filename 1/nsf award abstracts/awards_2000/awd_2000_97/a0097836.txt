Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a three-year REU Site in Construction, at
              Arizona State University, under the direction of Dr. Anil Sawhney.  The 10-week
              on-site summer program will involve 10 undergraduate students each year in the
              individual research projects of 12 faculty members.  A key focus of the REU
              site will be studies and research in areas that are of significance to the
              construction industry.  Research activities include an orientation workshop,
              participating faculty presentations, 9-week individual research program,
              interaction with current graduate students, workshop on construction
              management, biweekly research seminars, final research presentation, and final
              panel discussion of contruction industry experts describing the current status
              of the industry and its research needs.
