Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Harvey Mudd College (HMC).  Shenda
              Baker is the site's Program Director. Eight faculty will serve as REU student
              mentors.  Over the award period (2001-2003), eight students will be supported
              each summer in a ten-week program.  Only female students will be recruited and
              accepted. No more than one-half of the participants may be from HMC.  The
              research projects offered are in the areas of analytical, biological,
              inorganic, organic, physical, and theoretical chemistry. Summer research
              activities will be supplemented with workshops on careers in chemistry and
              scientific ethics, seminars, and a plant tour to an operating chemical
              facility.  Program assessment will include tracking the students' major upon
              graduation, publications, career path and eventual degree obtained. An
              anonymous program evaluation form will also be used to provide feedback on ways
              to improve the students' summer research experience.
