Abstract    :
              The REU site focuses on mathematics and statistics applied to industrial
              problems.  The problems come from local business and industry, partners of
              WPI's Center for Industrial Mathematics and Statistics.  The students work
              closely with a company representative who introduces them to the problem and
              guides their work to a solution the company can really use.  The faculty
              advisor helps them maintain a focus on the mathematical issue at the core of
              the problem.  The whole experience is designed to provide the students with a
              glimpse of the ways that advanced mathematics is used to solve real-world
              problems.
The selection of students is based on academic qualifications,
              career objectives and past work experience.  Working in teams of 2 to 4,
              students meet daily with the faculty advisor and provide oral and written
              progress reports for the other teams and the company representative.  In this
              way, the projects help develop some skills in communication and teamwork that
              are crucial for success in a nonacademic work environment.
In addition
              presentations by mathematicians who work in industry and site-visits to
              companies contribute to providing the students with a complete image of
              industrial mathematics.
