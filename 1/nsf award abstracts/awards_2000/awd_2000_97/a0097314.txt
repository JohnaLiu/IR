              ABSTRACT
Kroetz

The PI proposes to continue his investigations on the
              holomorphic aspects of representations
of Lie groups. An emphasis will be
              taken towards applications to automorphic forms and harmonic analysis. In
              particular, one objective is to obtain estimates on the Fourier coefficients of
              automorphic forms. 

The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the
              Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in
              twentieth century mathematics. As the mathematical vehicle for exploiting the
              symmetries inherent in a system, the representation theory of Lie groups has
              had a
profound impact upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and
              number theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum mechanics and
              elementary particle physics.
