Abstract    :
              JILA (formerly Joint Institute of Laboratory Astrophysics) and the University of
              Colorado Department of Physics will conduct REU summer programs introducing
              12-14 undergraduates to active, on-going physics research.  The faculty are
              well-recognized contributors to the fields of Atomic, Molecular and Optical
              Physics, Chemical Physics, Condensed Matter Physics, Elementary Particle
              Physics, Geophysics, and Gravitational physics.  Special efforts will be made
              to include significant participation levels from women and minorities.  The
              students will be expected to master at least a part of a large task. Weekly
              meetings, lab tours and field trips will ensure an active and supportive
              environment for all students.   At the end of their 10-week employment they
              will give short seminars describing their work and write a report.  Students
              from smaller colleges will be exposed to graduate students here, thus
              encouraging the undergraduates to continue their education.
