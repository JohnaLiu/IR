Abstract    :
              The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at University of Kansas
has
              developed a summer program to help undergraduate students understand
how
              scientific research is conducted.  To achieve this goal, 30 students
(10 in
              each of the years 2001-2003) will be recruited to spend 10 weeks at
the
              University of Kansas campus in Lawrence, Kansas.  Students in the
program will
              learn about research in two main ways.  First, each student
will be paired
              with a faculty mentor and will complete their own research
project. 
              Participating faculty have varied interests (ecological study at
many spatial
              scales; research on evolutionary patterns and processes at
several time
              scales), so a diversity of research projects will be done.
Second, students
              will participate in many group activities including weekly
seminars and tours
              of research facilities.  Students will also get
additional research exposure
              by presenting their results at a research
symposium and attending a national
              scientific meeting in their discipline.
An objective of this program is to
              provide research experiences for
students who are unlikely to have this
              opportunity at their home
institution and therefore help encourage a diverse
              population of students
to consider scientific careers.  Thus, although
              recruitment will be
nationwide, a particular focus will be to attract students
              from smaller
institutions with fewer research faculty, and students from
              institutions
with high minority enrollment.  In particular, students from
              Haskell Indian
Nations University, Lawrence, KS will be encouraged to become
              involved.
