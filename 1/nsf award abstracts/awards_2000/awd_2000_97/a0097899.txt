Abstract    :
              This First Symposium on Polymers in the Marine Environment will focus on the
              demanding combination of properties required for applications of polymers in
              the marine environment.  The symposium is the first to combine the technical,
              environmental, and biological elements that contribute to the challenge of
              formulating polymers for the marine environment.  
%%%
The symposium will
              focus on the latest research on (a) Nontoxic fouling release polymers, (b)
              Membranes for shipboard water purification, (c) Advanced resins for marine
              composites, (d) Corrosion control with redox polymers, and (e) Novel concepts
              involving the use of polymers in marine applications
