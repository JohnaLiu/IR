Abstract    :
              The Northeastern University sponsors a NSF-REU program at Cern each summer. 
              CERN is the European Laboratory for Particle Physics and it straddles the
              border between Switzerland and France just outside Geneva.  It is the foremost
              facility of its kind in the world, and the REU Site at CERN is designed to give
              ten US science and engineering undergraduates the opportunity to participate in
              the annual CERN Summer Student Programme.  The successful students are chosen
              after an exhaustive national search.  They are chosen not only for their
              outstanding academic background and interest in physics, but also to provide as
              eclectic a group of students as possible to represent American diversity to the
              Europeans.  At CERN the US students join a select group of international
              physics students and participate in a variety of educational and social
              activities.  Although the US is not an official member state of CERN, the US
              students are treated exactly the same as member state students and they enjoy
              all the benefits of being an official CERN Summer Student.  Activities include:
              attending lectures by experts in a variety of fields in physics, engineering
              and computing; working with and learning from world-renowned physicists;
              collaborating on multi-national research projects including CMS and ATLAS at
              the Large Hadron Collider.  This unique opportunity not only allows the
              students to learn fundamental physics in a research environment, but it also
              gives them the benefit of working in an international setting.
