Title:  Semantics of Implicit Procedure-Calling
              Mechanisms
PI:  Mitchell Wand

Modern software architectures display
              extremely dynamic patterns of procedure invocation, in which it is difficult to
              determine what procedure is invoked from any call site.  These architectures
              are sometimes called implicit invocation architectures.  This project proposes
              to study two mechanisms for implicit procedure invocation:  event-based
              programming (also known as the Observer pattern), and aspect-oriented
              programming.  It proposes to develop control-flow analyses for these
              mechanisms, and to consider the correctness of translations between these
              mechanisms and more traditional models of computation.  It also proposes to
              extend the principal investigator's previous work on contextual equivalence to
              consider equivalence in contexts limited by architectural constraints.
