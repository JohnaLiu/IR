Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports a new Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site at Indiana University.  Steven Wietstock is the
              site's Program Director; Dennis Peters is the Co-Program Director.
              Approximately thirty faculty will be available to serve as REU student mentors.
               During the award period (2001-2003), each summer ten students will participate
              in a ten-week program.  Recruitment will be via faculty contacts at smaller
              colleges in the immediate geographic area, including the urban centers of
              Chicago, Cincinnati, Detroit, Louisville and Milwaukee. In addition, minority
              recruitment efforts will be directed through existing contacts at Clark Atlanta
              University, Morehouse College, New Mexico State University, Spelman College,
              University of North Carolina at Pembroke, and Xavier University of Louisiana. 
              Student research projects will be available in analytical, biological,
              inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry.  Included in the summer schedule of
              activities are classes on ethics in science and chemical information.  A visit
              to a local chemical industry is planned.  The summer program will conclude with
              the students participating in a mini-symposium poster presentation and
              submitting a final research report in the style of a journal article.  A survey
              at the end of the program will be completed by each of the student
              participants.  A networking system will be established through e-mail and
              listserve systems to keep track of the students after they leave the program.
