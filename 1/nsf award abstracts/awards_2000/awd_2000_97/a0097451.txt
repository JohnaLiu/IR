Abstract    :
              James Madison University will host an eight-week REU program for six
              undergraduates per year during the summer of 2002.  The primary goal of the
              program is to provide its student participants with an authentic mathematical
              research experience.  The components of program include:   (1) Working with
              another student on a research project with a faculty mentor;  (2) Writing a
              research paper containing project results; (3) Participating in a common
              seminar at the beginning of the program;  (4) Presenting results to the other
              research groups throughout the program;  (5) Visiting research mathematicians
              at NASA in Langley, VA; (6) Participating in social activities with
              undergraduate research students in biology, chemistry, physics, and geology; 
              (7) Having results "refereed" by an external panel; (8)  Presenting results at
              professional meetings during the following academic year; and  (9) Continued
              contact with the mentors after the end of the project.  As part of the
              evaluation process, an external review panel will evaluate the program's
              success and provide a "referee's report" for individual student projects.  At
              least three of the six participating students will be recruited from outside
              the institution, and a significant effort will be made to recruit students from
              institutions less likely to have resources available to support undergraduate
              research activity, as well as members of mathematically underrepresented
              groups.
