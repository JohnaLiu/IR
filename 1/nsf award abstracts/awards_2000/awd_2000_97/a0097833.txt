Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a 3-year summer REU site in Environmental
              Research at the University of Idaho, under the direction of Dr. Margrit von
              Braun.  This site will provide a challenging summer experience conducting
              environmental restoration and remediation research for a diverse group of 10
              undergraduate students who have limited opportunities to conduct research at
              their home institutions and who are primarily underrepresented in science and
              engineering.  Working closely with a faculty mentor the students will work on
              individual research projects with topics such as phyto-and bioremediation,
              supercritical fluid extraction of mixed waste, biologically engineered
              treatment systems, aqueous geochemistry, and watershed restoration.  Students
              will also participate in scholarly and recreational activities, such as weekly
              REU research forums, lunches with professional and academic role models,
              evening dinner seminars, workshops on environmental ethics, and weekend field
              trips led by faculty mentors.
