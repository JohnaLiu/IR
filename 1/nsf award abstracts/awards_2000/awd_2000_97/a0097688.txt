REU Sites:  Virtual Environments REU Site

 The focus of this
              NSF-REU program to be hosted at West Virginia University is "virtual
              environments."  The objectives of the program are (1) to give undergraduate
              students practical skills in advanced visualization techniques where
              "visualization" has the extended meaning of "presentation of information to the
              ears, or the fingers, or even the nose"; (2) to give undergraduate students
              practical experience in multidisciplinary research applying virtual
              environments (VE) technology to problems in physical science, health science,
              and social science; (3) to help undergraduates discover the excitement of a
              career in research; and (4) to provide a cross cultural experience, by bringing
              together students primarily from the Appalachian region and from Puerto Rico
              and by giving some students the opportunity to work in an academic research lab
              in Japan.

Our recruiting goal is to have 3 students from the University of
              Puerto Rico-Mayaguez, 6 students from four year colleges in West Virginia and
              the Appalachian region, and 3 students from WVU each summer.  These students
              are expected to come from a variety of majors, including biology, computer
              science, geography, and physics and will be divided into teams to work with
              faculty and graduate student researchers on problems in computer science,
              geographic information systems, materials science, and pharmacy.  Each week
              except for the first and last week of the summer program, students will work on
              Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays with researchers on specific disciplinary
              research projects.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays they will attend half day
              training sessions on specific VE technologies and tools, work in the VE Lab,
              and participate in a weekly research seminar involving all participants,
              undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty. 

After each summer
              program in 2001, 2002, and 2003, three students will be selected from that
              year's participants to work in the Virtual Systems Laboratory at Gifu
              University in Japan during the following summer.  The program will provide
              Japanese language and culture training for these selected participants during
              spring before their summer experience in Japan.
