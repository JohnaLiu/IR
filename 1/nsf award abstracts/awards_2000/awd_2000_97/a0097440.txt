Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at California State University-Los
              Angeles.  Scott Nickolaisen is the site's Program Director.  Fifteen faculty
              will serve as REU student mentors.  Over the award period (2001-2003), ten
              students will be supported each summer in a ten-week program.  The focus of
              recruitment efforts will be on the very high concentration of minority students
              enrolled in regional public community colleges in the Los Angeles area.  These
              students will have had very little, if any, exposure to a comprehensive
              research experience.  The areas of chemical research include inorganic and
              organic synthesis, electron spin resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance,
              infrared and laser spectroscopy, enzyme kinetics, plant genetics,
              electrochemistry, organometallic photochemistry, protein assays, mass
              spectrometry, atmospheric chemistry, lipid biochemistry, and capillary
              electrophoresis.  At the conclusion of the program, student participants will
              present their results to the department in a poster presentation and will
              prepare a short written report of their research project.  Following the
              program, students will be tracked to evaluate their development.
