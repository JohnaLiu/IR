Abstract    :
                 The annual meeting of the Rocky Mountain Regional Neuroscience Group provides
              a unique opportunity for scientists in this geographically isolated region to
              interchange results and ideas in neuroscience.   Participants hear an
              internationally known keynote speaker, learn about ongoing research in regional
              laboratories, and meet neuroscientists from regional universities and colleges.
               Faculty and students from departments of neuroscience, psychology, and
              biology, from smaller colleges as well as major universities come to provide
              interactions that foster undergraduate participation and exchange of graduate
              training information, as well as potential collaborations.  This award provides
              partial funding for the conference, primarily for small travel awards for
              participants from distant schools, to help defray student expenses, and for
              publication of an abstract volume.
    This meeting will have an impact on
              career choices of many students who attend, and will foster collaborative
              opportunities between the many colleges represented.
