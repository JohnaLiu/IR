Abstract    :
              


Biology faculty will mentor 30 undergraduate biology students (10 each
              summer for three years) in a Research Experiences for Undergraduates program
              based at the University of Colorado's Mountain Research Station.  The
              objectives of the program are to engage students in scientific research at an
              early stage in their academic development and to encourage these students to
              pursue careers in research and teaching.   Students from underrepresented
              groups will be actively recruited to participate in our program.  The program
              focus is on ecology, behavior, and evolution, with the largest number of
              students engaged in projects in community and ecosystems ecology.  Each summer,
              students will participate in an intensive one-week introduction to research,
              followed by nine weeks of research supervised by faculty mentors.  The
              University's NSF funded Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program is based
              at the Mountain Station, and students benefit from formal and informal
              interactions with LTER researchers.     While undertaking their projects,
              students learn the principles underlying biological research and gain
              experience with current scientific techniques.  In addition to final
              presentations of their results at the end of the summer, students are
              encouraged to publish their findings in peer reviewed scientific journals.
