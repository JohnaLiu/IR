Abstract    :
              Through Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF), SURFing the Physics
              Lab: A NIST-NSF Partnership for Physics will continue to provide an opportunity
              for the Physics Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and
              Technology to encourage outstanding physics students to pursue scientific
              careers.  For the past seven years, the NSF-NIST SURF program has exposed
              students to world-class atomic, molecular, optical and radiation physicists and
              facilities in the NIST Physics Laboratory.  Over this time, the NSF-NIST SURF
              program has been a host to an annual average of twenty-four students from
              twelve or more undergraduate institutions to pursue research projects of
              national and international importance.  The selected group of students will
              spend twelve weeks engaged in physics research at the Physics Laboratory's
              Gaithersburg site, working one on one with NIST staff physicists in projects
              that combine the quest for fundamental knowledge and direct applications to
              problems of national importance, and learning about nonacademic alternatives
              for research careers.  The students will also participate in the weekly SURFing
              the Physics Lab Summer Seminar Series.  SURF students will present a research
              seminar at NIST and be encouraged to participate in a local or national
              scientific conference during the following academic year.
