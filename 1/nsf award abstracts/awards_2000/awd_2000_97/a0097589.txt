Abstract    :
              Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute operates a Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site in its Materials Science and Engineering Department.
              The goal of the program is to expose undergraduate students to materials
              science and engineering through hands-on research and to the connections
              between fundamental research and real-world engineering problems.  Ten students
              are recruited every year for a ten-week summer research experience.  Research
              projects offered range from weld-line fracture of superalloys to synthesis of
              nanomaterials, to the properties of electronic materials, with a common theme
              on structure-property relationships.  Some of the projects involve industrial
              participation and in those cases students will spend part of the time at the
              industrial laboratory.
