Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports a new Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates site at Idaho State University.  Dennis Strommen is the site's
              Program Director and he will be assisted by Karl De Jesus, Co-Program Director.
               Over the award period (2001-2003), ten students will be supported each summer
              in a ten-week program. The students recruited will be from two-year
              institutions primarily in the Northwest.  Seven Chemistry faculty will offer
              research in the areas of atmospheric pollutants, solar energy conversion
              processes, mechanism of action of thalidomide, removal of Hg(II) from aqueous
              systems, development of cyanide detection, and chemometrics.  As a major result
              of this program, the organizers anticipate the development of the interaction
              between Idaho State University and the two-year institutions in the Northwest. 
              The achievement of this objective will be central to assessing the success of
              the REU site.
