Abstract    :
              It is planned to study both bound and continuum properties of lightly ionized
              medium- to high-Z atoms and ions.  Both relativity and electron-electron
              interactions (correlations) must be considered.  The case of negative ions is
              particularly challenging, as most such systems are unbound in the absence of
              correlations.  It is intended to extend present bound state methods to include
              the continuum case, permitting for example a discussion of photoionization. 
              The present bound state methodolgy will also be extended to permit a treatment
              of middle of the row transition metals.
