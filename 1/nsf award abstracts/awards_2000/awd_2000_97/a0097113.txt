Abstract    :
              We will continue our Summer Research Experience Program for Undergraduate at
              SUNY College at Potsdam, joint with Clarkson University.   We will be involving
              nine undergraduates in doing research in the areas of Group theory, Graph
              Theory, and Topology.  Experience has shown that close cooperation with
              undergraduate 
students and including them as participants in faculty research
              stimulates their interest in mathematics and helps them to learn a considerable
              amount of advanced material.

At least six of the nine students will be
              chosen from institutions other than those participating.  Women and minorities
              will be strongly encouraged to apply.  Potsdam College will provide free
              dormitory rooms, office space, and study lounges for the students.  SUNY
              Potsdam and Clarkson will provide library access and computer support.  The
              institutions involved will pay the salaries of the student leaders.  Student
              leaders will assist in running the program and will also provide role models
              for students.  In this way they help both the students and advisors.

The
              goal of this program will be to build the participants' confidence in their
              ability to do research independently and to stimulate their interest in
              pursuing mathematics.  To expand the students' horizons, there will be one talk
              each week by a guest expert.
