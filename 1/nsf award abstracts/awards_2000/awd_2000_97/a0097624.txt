Abstract    :
              The University of Notre Dame physics department NSF-REU program provides an
              opportunity for at least 12 undergraduate physics majors/year to discover the
              excitement of physics research. Additional students (typically 3-4 per year),
              beyond those funded by the NSF, will be supported, as has been the case in the
              past, by the physics department and by various research grants. The program
              lasts for 10 weeks during Summer (typically starting on the day after Memorial
              Day) and consists of participation in a research project, weekly research
              seminars, development of a research logbook, a research paper, contact with
              various research groups, and social gatherings with other members of the
              department. The areas available for research projects are: nuclear physics
              (nuclear structure and lifetimes, nucleosynsthesis, heavy-ion reactions,
              nuclear astrophysics), atomic physics (theory, laser cooling, atomic
              lifetimes), astrophysics (g-ray and neutrino astrophysics, physics of comets,
              irregular satellites, chemistry of young stellar systems), high energy physics
              (theory, development of scintillating-fiber detectors, physics at BaBar,
              Tevatron and LHC), and solid state physics and microelectronics (crystal
              growth, scanning tunneling microscope development, low temperature
              superconductivity, theory, EXAFS physics). All students are involved with
              active and ongoing research efforts and are encouraged to become contributing
              members in the everyday problem-solving events. The REU students are also
              provided an opportunity to become acquainted with other areas of research
              within the department.
