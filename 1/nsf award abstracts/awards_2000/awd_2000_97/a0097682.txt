Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports a new Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site at Youngstown State University (YSU).  Daryl Mincey
              is the site's Program Director. The Co-Program Directors are Allen Hunter, John
              Jackson, Sherri Lovelace-Cameron, and Timothy Wagner. Thirteen faculty will
              serve as REU student mentors.  During the award period (2001-2003), each summer
              ten students will participate in a twelve-week program.  Recruitment efforts
              will be directed toward students from the Public Private Alliance (PPA) that
              consists of nine four-year institutions located in Ohio and Pennsylvania.  The
              program calls for five faculty members from PPA to also be involved each summer
              in the research, thus allowing for the continuation of the research beyond the
              summer.  Most of the faculty are just starting their careers and thus their
              projects are timely and are supported by various state and national
              organizations. The research projects offered are in the areas of analytical,
              inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry.  During the program, each of the
              REU supported students will give a fifteen-minute progress seminar.  A poster
              presentation will be held at the conclusion of the summer program. The YSU
              Beeghly Center for Education Research will evaluate the program through both
              formative and summative measures.
