The Southeastern Association for Research in Astronomy (SARA)
              provides a collaborative effort involving 6 southeastern United States
              universities for a NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site
              Program.  The consortium includes Florida Institute of Technology (FIT), East
              Tennessee State University (ETSU), Florida International University (FIU), the
              University of Georgia at Athens (UGA), Valdosta State University (VSU), and
              Clemson University.  The program emphasizes the preparation of students for
              careers in science and engineering through one-on-one collaboration with
              faculty who are experienced undergraduate student research mentors.  Over a
              dozen research projects are offered ranging from space weather, to
              spectroscopic studies of minor planets, to the determination of the Galactic
              disk age from white dwarf stars, to target of opportunity observations of
              active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray burst optical counterparts.  At least 12
              REU students annually will use the SARA Observatory in Arizona during the
              course of their 8-10 week summer research activities.  In addition, multi-day
              workshops will expose each of them to astronomy as practiced at 2-3 SARA
              institutions during their summer internships.  Continuing collaboration and the
              presentation of papers at national meetings after the summer program is also
              supported.
