              ABSTRACT

OCE-0097337

The prediction of future atmospheric CO2
              concentrations requires an in depth understanding of the feedbacks that operate
              between the physical, biological and chemical components of the global climate
              system.  One means of studying these feedbacks is to investigate observed past
              variability in the marine carbon cycle, as has been done in the tropical
              Pacific in connection with the El Nino Southern Oscillation.  However, little
              is known about the contribution of the subtropical and subpolar gyres to
              atmospheric CO2 variations, despite the fact that these gyres cover more that
              half of the world's ocean.  For this reason, principal investigators from the
              University of California-Los Angeles, the Bermuda Biological Research Station
              and the National Center for Atmospheric Research will address this gap by
              focusing on the following goals:  (1) quantify the variability in the marine
              carbon cycle in the subtropical and subpolar gyres on interannual to decadal
              time scales and determine the role of these oceanic regions in the observed
              temporal and spatial variability in atmospheric CO2; (2) evaluate and quantify
              the contributions from biological and physical processes to the observed
              variability; and (3) establish the feedbacks that operate between the physical,
              chemical and biological processes in the ocean.  Results from this study will
              significantly advance the understanding of the response of the upper ocean
              carbon cycle to interannual variability.
