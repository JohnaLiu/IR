Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Michigan.  Brian
              Coppola is the site's Program Director and Seyhan Ege as Co-Program Director
              will assist him. In addition there will be available 48 faculty as REU student
              mentors.  Over the award period (2001-2003), the students will be supported
              each summer in a ten-week program, where they will join 50-60 other students. 
              The focus of the program is designed to provide the students with the
              experience of doing research in a large graduate department of a Research-I
              institution. Students will have access to all of the research groups of the
              Chemistry Department including interdisciplinary programs in materials
              chemistry, bio-related chemistry, medicinal chemistry and environmental
              chemistry. A relationship is established between each of the students and
              research group before arriving on campus.  The program concludes with each
              student presenting his/her research results at a regional research meeting.
