Abstract    :
              The project will improve our understanding of African land-surface conditions in
              evolution of regional climate at seasonal, interannual, and decadal time
              scales. In most previous modeling assessments, land-surface conditions were
              prescribed to their current or former states and their impact on African
              climate assessed using an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM). Dr. Xue
              will investigate climate--land-surface interactions using a two-way coupled
              model, in which vegetation responds to circulation as well. This is often
              referred to as "dynamic" vegetation modeling. Dr. Xue will incorporate a
              dynamic global vegetation model, called TRIFFID (Top-down Representation of
              Interactive Foliage and Flora Including Dynamics), within National Centers for
              Environmental Prediction (NCEP)'s global and regional (eta) climate models and
              compare the evolution of simulated vegetation with recent satellite based
              high-resolution estimates of vegetation. The TRIFFID model was developed at the
              United Kingdom Meteorological Office, and Peter Cox, who was instrumental in
              its development, is collaborating with Dr. Xue on this project. The project is
              unique in its coupling of a comprehensive model of the atmosphere, such as the
              NCEP GCM or eta model, to a dynamic vegetation model.

The Large-scale
              Dynamic Meteorology (LDM/ATM), Climate Dynamics (CDP/ATM), and the Hydrologic
              Sciences (HSP/EAR) programs in NSF's Geosciences directorate are funding this
              project.
