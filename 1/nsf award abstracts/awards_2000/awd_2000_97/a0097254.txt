Abstract    :
              This award to the University of Oregon by the NSF Chemistry Division's Special
              Projects, and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH,
              supports activities by the Committee on the Advancement of Women Chemists to
              increase the number and the effectiveness of women in leadership positions in
              the chemical sciences. The project will (1) conduct research aimed at
              understanding the factors that are inhibiting the careers of female faculty in
              the chemical sciences, (2) develop and implement programs that increase the
              number of female faculty, (3) establish networks among peers, (4) develop
              programs that increase the career success of women, and (5) evaluate and
              disseminate what is learned.  This project will address gender disparity in the
              academic chemical science workforce.
