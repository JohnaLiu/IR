Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports a new Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site at Wichita State University.  Paul Rillema is the
              site's Program Director; Erach Talaty is the Co-Program Director. Nine faculty
              will be available to serve as REU student mentors.  During the award period
              (2001-2003), each summer ten students will participate in a ten-week program. 
              Recruitment efforts will be 54 institutions of higher learning in the state of
              Kansas.  There will be a special effort devoted to attract women and
              minorities.  The research focus will cover all the basic areas of chemistry,
              and involve a range of topics such as solar energy conversion, inorganic
              ferromagnetic, molecular association by mass spectrometry, electrochemistry of
              porphyrins, heterocyclic chemistry, mechanisms of bio-organic reactions and
              theoretical calculations.  Other activities planned for the student
              participants include workshops and off-campus visits.  Student participants
              will conclude the program with a oral presentation at a local symposium. A
              final written research report is also required.  Evaluation of the program will
              include input from both the students and the participating faculty.
