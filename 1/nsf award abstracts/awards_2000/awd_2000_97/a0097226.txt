Abstract    :
              The objective of the REU at Rensselaer is to actively involve undergraduates in
              ongoing frontier physics research.  The research projects cover Astrophysics,
              Condensed Matter Physics, Optical Physics, and Particle Physics. Features
              include: hands-on projects carefully designed by either using existing
              facilities, building simple instruments and interfaces, or using computer
              modeling and performing data analysis. In addition to daily contact among
              participants, graduate students and faculty, there are weekly group activities
              (seminars and field trips) that allow interaction among participants. Each
              research group will hold weekly group meetings to discuss technical issues
              regarding experiments or modeling.  At the end of the 1st week there are
              presentations of goals. In the 6th week each participant will deliver an oral
              progress presentation and a written progress report.  In the 10th week, each
              participant will do a poster presentation and submit a written final report.
              Guidelines for the preparation of reports and posters and samples are provided.
               The program philosophy is to allow students to experience the challenge, the
              excitement, and sometimes frustration involved in research outside the
              classroom.  The goal is to attract and encourage talented students including
              minorities and women into careers in sciences.
