Abstract    :
              The United States is hosting the 42nd International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)
              in the summer of 2001.  The IMO is the premier international mathematics
              competition for high school students and it will bring to the U.S. more than
              500 of the most talented high school age mathematicians from more than 80
              countries.

During the competition, students work individually over a two-day
              period on six challenging problems, presenting their solutions as essay-style
              proofs akin to those produced by research mathematicians.   While in this
              country, students are treated to American hospitality, visiting attractions in
              and around the Capital and experiencing American life and culture.  At the
              closing awards ceremony outstanding performances are honored by the awarding of
              gold, silver and bronze medals to students scoring in the top half of the
              field.

A number of outreach and research activities are planned as a way of
              enhancing public understanding of appreciation of mathematics and to engage a
              larger number of young Americans in mathematics.
