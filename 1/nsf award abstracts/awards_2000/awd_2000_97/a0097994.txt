Berkeley's unique Infrared Spatial Interferometer will be used for
              several types of high-resolution measurements. These include interferometric
              measurement of the diameters of old stars in narrow spectral regions of the
              mid-infrared (10 micron) region chosen to avoid spectral lines due to gases in
              the atmospheres of stars and to include only continuum radiation. Measurements
              on the spectral lines themselves can be used to determine the spatial
              distribution of the circumstellar gas. Recently enlarged baselines on the
              interferometer allow accurate measurement of stellar sizes. In particular,
              changes in the diameter of the brightest Mira variables can be measured and
              these should lead to information about departures from the sphericity of these
              stars. One particular advantage of working at such long wavelengths is that the
              uncertainties due to limb darkening are much smaller.
