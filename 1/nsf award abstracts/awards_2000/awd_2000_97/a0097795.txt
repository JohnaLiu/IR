Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at California State University -
              Fullerton (CSUF).  John Olmsted is the site's Program Director; Peter de Lijser
              is the Co-Program Director. Ten faculty will serve as REU student mentors. 
              During the award period (2001-2003), each summer ten students will participate
              in a ten-week program. The student recruitment focus is on local communities
              (community colleges and CSUF undergraduates) and on communities where chemistry
              is not strongly represented (minorities and females). The research projects
              offered are in the areas of analytical, inorganic, organic, and physical
              chemistry.  To complement the research involvement of the students during the
              summer, special emphasis will be placed on scientific writing.  Ethical issues
              will be presented to the students in the form of three ethical and
              environmental issues. The summer program will conclude with all students
              presenting their research at a seminar, presenting a poster, and submitting a
              written report.  An additional component of the program is a series of seminars
              and discussions that address ethical issues.  The program will be monitored by
              a variety of surveys sent to current and former REU participants.
