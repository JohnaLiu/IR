A long-standing problem in astronomy is the origin of the
              circumstellar disks that cause the characteristic Balmer line emission of
              classical Be stars. The basic task undertaken in this award is to understand
              the way in which these disks are generated, maintained and dispersed. It is
              probable that they originate from active regions in or near the surface of the
              rapidly rotating star and are generated by radial mass ejections augmented with
              energy supplied by the rotational motion of the star which is locked into the
              outflowing gas by strong regional magnetic fields. The work requires the
              consideration of a wide range of physical processes such as radiatively driven
              mass loss, non-radial pulsation, rapid stellar rotation and the interaction of
              all of these with magnetic fields. Individually and in various combinations,
              these processes play a key role in many other astrophysical systems on scales
              from planets to galaxies. Thus the work done here will have wide applicability
              to other areas of contemporary astrophysics.
