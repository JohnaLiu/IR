Abstract    :
              The Bucknell University "Summer Research Program in Physics" will give 8
              undergraduate students per summer the opportunity to collaborate with a member
              of the Bucknell physics faculty for 10 weeks on his or her research.  Students
              will be recruited from around the country.  Bucknell's setting as a small
              liberal arts college provides the perfect environment for some student's first
              encounter with full-time research.  The level of student-faculty interaction
              will be high.  This immersion in a research environment is intended to
              complement traditional classroom experiences of the students.  For many it will
              be their first contact with the excitement and demands of full-time research. 
              Participation will help students make career choices, and will provide specific
              preparation for those that continue on to graduate studies in physics.  All of
              the students will live together on the Bucknell campus, conduct most of their
              research in on-campus facilities, and participate in weekly departmental
              seminars and colloquia. We will be offering projects in theoretical physics
              (statistical physics, gravitation, quantum optics), experimental physics
              (biophysics, atomic physics, nonlinear dynamics and pattern formation),
              computer simulation, and astronomy.
