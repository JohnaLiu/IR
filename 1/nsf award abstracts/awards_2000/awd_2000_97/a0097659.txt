Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              (REU) site at the University of Virginia, where a previous REU site was funded
              for 1997-1999.  James Demas is the site's Program Director; Milton Brown is the
              Co-Program Director. Eight faculty will serve as REU student mentors.  During
              the award period (2001-2003), each year ten students will participate in a
              ten-week program.  They will be recruited from institutions that do not offer
              Chemistry Ph.D. programs.  Special efforts will be made to attract females and
              other underrepresented minority students.  A combination of weekly meetings,
              interim talks and reports will serve to monitor the student's progress.  The
              students will conclude their experience with a final written report and a talk
              presented at a mini-symposium.
