Abstract    :
              In this project the investigators will study experimentally the dynamic
              evolution of prepared quantum states using a newly-developed wave-particle
              correlator.  In a cavity QED system, where optically pumped atoms interact with
              a single mode of a driven high finesse optical cavity, the conditional field
              measured by the wave-particle correlator will allow the reconstruction of the
              evolution of the quantum state.   The conditional measurements will be coupled
              to quantum feedback control to find ways to stabilize the quantum state.  A new
              study of the development of time asymmetries in correlation functions by
              looking at the relationship between correlations and measurement back action
              will also be undertaken.
