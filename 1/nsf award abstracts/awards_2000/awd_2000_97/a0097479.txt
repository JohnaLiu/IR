Abstract    :
              North Carolina State University operates a Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site in its Physics Department. The REU Site offers
              research opportunities in physics for rising seniors.  Undergraduate research
              projects span the areas of materials and condensed matter physics, with some
              projects in other areas of physics. Fifteen undergraduate students are
              recruited every year for a ten-week summer research experience.  Opportunities
              are also available for travel to professional meetings during the academic year
              to present results from the summer research.  Objectives of the program are to
              provide a rich research experience for rising seniors that will encourage them
              to continue graduate studies and will help them in making informed decisions
              about academic programs.
