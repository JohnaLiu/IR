Abstract    :
              Selected undergraduate physics majors will participate in scientific research
              projects; each student will work directly with a faculty member of the
              Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Toledo.  Possible
              research areas include astrophysics, atomic physics, biological physics,
              condensed matter physics, materials science, medical physics, optics,
              photonics, and plasma physics.  Projects will be parts of significant ongoing
              research programs, and will often result in scientific publications.  These
              opportunities will be advertised nationally and the students will be selected
              competitively.  In addition to stipends and housing for a ten-week research
              program, students will be given financial support for travel to and from
              Toledo.  Also, students will be encouraged to present a paper at a regional or
              national scientific meeting, and provided financial support for that purpose. 
              The students will also attend workshops to learn how to choose a graduate
              school, prepare for the GRE, and present a public talk.   Eight students will
              be supported by the NSF-REU program and two additional students will be
              supported by funds from the University of Toledo.
