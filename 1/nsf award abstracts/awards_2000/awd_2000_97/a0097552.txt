Abstract    :
              Systematics and evolution are central concepts in biological
disciplines. 
              Knowledge of the manner in which species are related to each
other and the
              mechanisms by which they become distributed across the globe
provide a
              framework (in evolutionary trees for example) for organizing and
communicating
              ideas and advances, for example in terms of biodiversity or
comparative
              genomics. Our program provides students with a coherent,
hands-on introduction
              to research in systematics and comparative
evolutionary biology, and serves a
              critical role in attracting, inspiring
and educating undergraduate students in
              the fundamental importance of these
biological disciplines.  Students enrolled
              in the AMNH REU program have at
their disposal world-class collections of
              fishes, dinosaurs, reptiles,
amphibians, mammals and invertebrates, as well as
              cutting edge research
facilities in the Molecular Genomics laboratories, and
              the museum's
research library.  Project titles, while all concerned with the
              basic role
of evolution and systematics, span a range of topics as broad as
              those
being investigated by the museum's curators, including the use of
              genetic,
histological, anatomical and paleontological data types. The
              American
Museum of Natural History is an inspirational place for young
              scientists to
work, and an REU program is a wonderful way for us to bring a
              critical mass
of bright young scholars into our departments and expose them to
              the
challenge and excitement of an original research program.
