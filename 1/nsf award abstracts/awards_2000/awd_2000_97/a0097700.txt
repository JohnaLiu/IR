Abstract    :
              The objective of the proposed work is to investigate and build a system for
              measuring finger postures and forces. The system will become an important
              milestone on the way to producing more effective haptic devices. In the
              existing systems the natural haptic sense of the human finger is lost or
              obstructed - this problem will be overcome in the current work. Fundamental
              properties of finger hemodynamics and tissue mechanics will be investigated, as
              well as design and signal properties issues. Nail sensor design will be
              optimized with respect to the distribution of photo diodes and the location and
              wavelength of LEDs across the nail surface. A nonlinear filter for motion
              artifact rejection will be designed.
