Abstract    :
              Pittsburg State University of Kansas operates a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site that introduces students to interdisciplinary
              materials research.  Ten undergraduate students are recruited every year for a
              ten-week summer research experience, with a recruitment focus on students from
              undergraduate and community colleges in the region.  Students participate in
              research projects under the supervision of faculty from the departments of
              Engineering Technology, Chemistry, Biology and the Business and Technology
              Institute at Pittsburg State.  The core of the research program is on polymers
              and plastics science and engineering.  In addition to research activities,
              students attend weekly seminars and participate in visits to local industries
              and in group social activities.
