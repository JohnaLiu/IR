Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the University of Maine, Eric N. Landis,
              Principal Investigator, for the support of a 3-year REU Site in Advanced
              Engineered Wood Composites.  This nine-week program will provide an
              interdisicpinary research experience for9 undergraduate science and engineering
              students with the focal point being the development of the next generation of
              engineered wood composites for construction applications.  The program will
              combine hands-on laboratory work with training in fundamental science and
              engineering principles.  Faculty mentors will work closely with students. 
              Weekly seminars wil include discussions of research techniques, ethics,
              graduate schools, as well as presentations made by the students.  Group field
              trips will include trips to major field test sites, government agencies,
              industries, and social events.  Follow-through after the students leave the
              site will consist of advisors working with their students on a technical paper
              based on the research, as well as advisors assisting students in applying to
              graduate school.
