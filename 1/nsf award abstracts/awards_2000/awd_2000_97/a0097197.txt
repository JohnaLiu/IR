Abstract    :
              With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program
              supports the work of Dr. David B. Collum at Cornell University in Ithaca, New
              York.   The work involves a detailed study of the solution structures and
              reactivities of organolithium aggregates in the presence of
              N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) and related diamines, as well as
              ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (THF).   The organolithium reagents will include
              n-BuLi, PhLi, and lithium acetylides.   Part of the work will focus on how
              BF3.amine complexes and other Lewis acid adducts influence the reactivities of
              the organolithium compounds.

Organolithium compounds, containing
              carbon-lithium bonds, are often written simply as RLi, where R is an organic
              group.   They are used as reagents to prepare a variety of more complex
              structures, with the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds.   The rates of these
              reactions, and the products formed, depend strongly on the presence of amine,
              ether, and Lewis acid additives.   Dr. Collum and his group are trying to
              understand what species are present in solution, and how their structures
              influence their reactivities.   The work is likely to be of interest to
              chemists in both academia and industry, and to provide excellent training for
              the students involved.
