Abstract    :
              Portland State University operates a Research Experience for Undergraduates
              (REU) Site. The REU Site offers research opportunities in applications of
              microscopy and microanalysis to multidisciplinary research.  Undergraduate
              research projects are supervised by faculty in the departments of physics,
              chemistry, geology, environmental biology and mechanical engineering at
              Portland State.  Eight undergraduate students are recruited every year for an
              eight-week summer research experience.  The program includes an academic year
              component that involves ten student participants.  The recruitment focus is on
              students from four-year colleges and community colleges in the greater Portland
              area.
