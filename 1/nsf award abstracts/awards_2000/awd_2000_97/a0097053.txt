Abstract    :
              This grant supports DYCOMS-II (Dynamics and Chemistry of Marine Stratocumulus),
              a collaborative field program conducted off the coast of California in July
              2001.  The work consists of (1) an observational study of marine stratocumulus
              clouds based on seven nocturnal flights of the NCAR C-130 equipped for
              measuring fluxes in and across the boundary layer; (2) analysis of these and
              previous data on the cloud-topped marine boundary layer; (3) comparison of the
              observations with the results of large-eddy simulations (LES).  The experiments
              are designed specifically to provide the data needed to validate LES. 
              Quantities of special interest are entrainment rates, structural features of
              cloud interfacial properties, and statistical properties of the turbulent air
              motions.  Demonstrating the ability to simulate these quantities is a crucial
              step in establishing LES as a tool for generating synthetic data to enable the
              testing of hypotheses and the construction of parameterizations to be used in
              large-scale atmospheric models.
