Abstract    :
              This is the first year funding of a three year continuing award.  This project
              concerns a new approach to evolutionary computation, called Learnable Evolution
              Model (LEM), which draws inspiration from "intellectual evolution" - an
              evolution of human ideas, designs, artifacts, organizations, etc.  Unlike
              conventional Darwinian-type evolutionary algorithms, in which new candidate
              solutions are created by semi-random mutations and/or recombinations, LEM
              generates new solutions by hypothesis formation (via machine learning) and
              hypothesis instantiation (via deduction).  Pilot studies have shown that LEM
              can accelerate evolutionary processes by two or more orders of magnitude over
              Darwininan-type algorithms (in terms of the number of births or fitness
              evaluations), and thus appears to be particularly advantageous in application
              domains in which fitness evaluations are time-consuming and/or costly, such as
              engineering optimization problems, evolutionary design, fluid dynamics, drug
              development, evolvable hardware, geological inversion, etc.  This research will
              explore LEM's capabilities, limitations, and scalability to complex
              optimization and engineering design tasks.  The PI will develop extensions of
              the initial methodology, and will experimentally test LEM in selected
              real-world problem domains.
