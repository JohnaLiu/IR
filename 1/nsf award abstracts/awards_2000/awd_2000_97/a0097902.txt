Abstract    :
              This proposal outlines a project to study the dynamics of the fundamental, but
              unsolved, many-body problem.  Atomic collisions represent particularly suitable
              systems for studying the many-body problem because intermediate particle
              numbers (3-10) between two-body and bodies with very large particle numbers can
              be precisely selected.  Highly differential and kinematically complete
              experimental studies on single and multiple ionization processes by positron,
              electron, proton, and highly charged ion impact will be performed.   Thus,
              direct comparisons for such processes between particles and antiparticles under
              otherwise the same conditions will become possible.  State-of-the-art
              technologies will be combined in multi-parameter coincidence experiments to
              simultaneously measure the momentum vectors of n-1 of the n collision products
              of the few-body systems.
