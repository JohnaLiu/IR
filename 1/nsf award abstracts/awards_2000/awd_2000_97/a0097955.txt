Abstract    :
              " The Composition of Galactic Globular Clusters "
AST- 0097955

In probing
              the early history of the Milky Way system, high weight is given to comparisons
              between the oldest stars that we can recognize and those that are being formed
              at the present time. The analysis is simplified when we can restrict attention
              to stars that have not yet evolved off the main sequence thereby contaminating
              their atmospheres with the products on nuclear burning. Good samples of
              ancient, unevolved stars can be found in globular clusters but they are faint
              and it is only with the availability of large ground-based instruments like the
              Keck 10m telescopes that we can study these stars in sufficient detail to make
              benchmark comparisons. During the course of this award the PI will take
              advantage of an opportunity to use the high-resolution spectroscopic capability
              of the Keck I telescope to obtain spectra of main sequence stars near the
              turnoff in several globular clusters among the halo population of the Milky
              Way. These spectra will be analyzed and chemical abundances determined with the
              long-term objective of putting quantitative constraints on the chemical
              evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy.
