This award provides funding for a
              3-year REU Site entitled, "Increasing Female/Minority Enrollment and Awareness
              in Biomedical Engineering Through Research Experiences for Undergraduates at
              Purdue University," under the direction of Dr. Karen Haberstroh.  The program
              will provide a 10-week summer research opportunity for 10 students each year. 
              During their summer at Purdue, students will work on original research projects
              in the various fields of Biomedical Engineering, including those pertaining to
              the life sciences as well as chemical, electrical, materials science, and
              mechanical engineering.
