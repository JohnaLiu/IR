Abstract    :
              This award provides funding for a 3 year, REU Site on Nanodevices at the
              University of Arkansas-Fayetteville, under the direction of Dr. William D.
              Brown.  Twelve junior and senior undergraduate students per year will
              participate in a 10 week summer cross-diisciplinary undergraduate research
              experience that will initiate a high level of interest to learn nanoscience
              based on the "teaching through doing" paradigm.  It will specifically address
              the teaching of surface science and quantum theory in the context of
              nanoscience. In addition, the students will learn to construct an educational
              framework through an industry-like organized training process that develops
              their teamwork, communication, and leadership skills.  They will also be
              exposed to the wide range of theory in a classroom environment support the
              program's experimental studies.
