The Association of American State Geologists will continue a program to
              provide undergraduate students in geoscience with field-oriented research
              experiences. The objectives of the program are to train students in scientific
              field techniques (particularly geologic mapping) and to excite and encourage
              students to pursue careers in geoscience. This program will enable these
              students to work side by side with experienced geologic mappers, field
              geologists, and geophysicists in the field. The mentors serve as not only
              teachers and mentors but also as scientific collaborators. State geological
              surveys in all 50 states and Puerto Rico are eligible to hire students through
              this program. Most student projects run during summer months, but some include
              field activities during other parts of the year. The success of the program is
              assessed by interviewing students and their mentors and by tracking the
              students' careers. These compiled data are reported to the general geoscience
              community. Individual state surveys will select students from geoscience
              departments and summer field-camp programs nationwide and from the summer
              field-training program administered by the National Association of Geoscience
              Teachers. It is expected that most of the state field projects will be linked
              to funded research through the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program
              (in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey) or other federal, state, local
              government or private sector programs.
