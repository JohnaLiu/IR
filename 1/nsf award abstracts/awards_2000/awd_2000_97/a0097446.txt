Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports a new Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site at City University of New York, College of Staten
              Island.  Ruth Stark is the site's Program Director; James Batteas is the
              Co-Program Director. Ten faculty will be available to serve as REU student
              mentors.  During the award period (2001-2003), each summer ten students will
              participate in a ten-week program.  Recruitment efforts will extend nationally
              in order to attract a diverse group of students.  The research focus will be on
              both synthetic and natural polymers--their synthesis, characterization, and
              physical properties.  Other activities planned for the student participants
              include workshops on the chemical literature, technical writing, and giving a
              scientific talk.  Seminars and field trips are also planned.  Student
              participants will conclude the program with a poster presentation at a local
              symposium. A final written research report is also required.  Evaluation of the
              program will include self-assessment, benchmarking, and a formal external
              review.
