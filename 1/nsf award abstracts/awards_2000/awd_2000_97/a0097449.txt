Abstract    :
              James Madison University operates a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
              Site. The REU Site offers research opportunities in materials science for
              students in physics, chemistry and integrated science programs.  Undergraduate
              research projects span the areas of advanced electronic and thermal materials
              processing and characterization.  Ten undergraduate students are recruited
              every year for a ten-week summer research experience, with a recruitment focus
              on students from predominantly undergraduate institutions in the mid-Atlantic
              region.  The REU Site helps introduce traditional science majors from James
              Madison University and from other non-engineering undergraduate institutions to
              interdisciplinary materials research.
