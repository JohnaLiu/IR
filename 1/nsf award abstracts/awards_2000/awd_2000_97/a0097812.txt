Abstract    :
              The Florida A&M University will sponsor a Research Experience for Undergraduates
              titled, the Florida A&M University Inter-Disciplinary Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (FAMU-IREU).  Participants will consist of undergraduate
              students majoring in chemistry, biology, physics, computer science, engineering
              and mathematics.  The FAMU-IREU will be offered to students who will be
              classified as juniors or seniors during the following Academic Year. 
              Participants will work in teams to solve real-world problems.   Each team will
              consist of participants from different disciplines.  Team members will blend
              the theories from these disciplines to develop and analyze solutions to complex
              problems taken from scientific, industrial and governmental organizations. Each
              team will develop a research paper that includes computer simulations and
              analyses.  

The FAMU-IREU Program will begin on May 15, and end on July 31. 
              Participants will be recruited from predominantly undergraduate universities
              throughout the United States.  Based on the local cost of living, each
              participant will receive $1,200.00 for housing and meals. Each participant in
              the will receive a stipend in the amount of $2,200.00 and some support for
              travel to and from the FAMU-IREU Program.  The point of contact person is Dr.
