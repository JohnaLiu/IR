Abstract    :
              This project is investigating the heterogeneous chemistry of reactive nitrogen
              species at the air-water interface.  Laboratory studies will be conducted to
              elucidate the elementary processes associated with the reaction of HNO3 with NO
              on various 'wet' solids, which are model components of dust particles in the
              atmosphere.  The production of HONO and other reaction products will be
              measured.  The reaction of HNO3 on ice surfaces with NO will also be
              investigated to determine if this could be the source of HONO that has recently
              been measured in the Arctic, which appears to be coming at least in part from
              the snowpack.  The results could have significant implications for modeling the
              global production of nitrogen oxides and ozone.
