Abstract    :
              This award supports the study of the phenomenon of polar mesosphere summer
              echoes (PMSE) through comparison of meteor radar measurements from Resolute Bay
              and Svalbard with additional MF radar measurements from stations located in
              Alaska and three radars located in the European sector at 78 N, 69 N, and 68 N
              latitudes.  The mesopause winds, echo power strengths, and mesopause
              temperature estimates derived from these radar measurements at both stations
              would be compared for simultaneous operations.  The primary motivation for this
              research is to examine the question as to whether cold mesopause temperatures
              are the only factor that underlies the production of these echoes.  Current
              preliminary evidence suggests that latitudinal and longitudinal differences in
              mesopause water vapor composition might also be a factor.  These measurements
              would be supplemented with studies related to observations obtained in the
              Antarctica at McMurdo and at the Peruvian Machu Picchu site (62 S, 58 W).
