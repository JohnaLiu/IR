Abstract    :
              In a Bose Einstein condensate (BEC) in a dilute atomic gas all atoms are in the
              same state.  It is planned to study properties of the condensate using methods
              from quantum optics.  These involve issues of coherence, superfluidity, and
              response to optical excitation. This would include studying the interactions of
              light with a dense and/or quantum degenerate gas, including the localization of
              light, and developing a theory for photodissociation of a BEC.  The
              corresponding situation of a dilute degenerate Fermi gas will be investigated.
