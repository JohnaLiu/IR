This award will supply shipboard
              scientific support equipment for the research vessel Ewing operated by the
              Columbia University Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) and dedicated to
              use in support of marine research.  The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment
              Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and
              safe conduct of ocean science research. The Program provides support for such
              items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and
              retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars,
              gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the location of research
              sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite
              transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment
              such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data
              retrieval sites.  The Project Director, Paul Ljunggren is fully qualified to
              direct this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the
              acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.  This project will allow
              the institution to acquire a telescoping crane, immersion suits through LDEO
              group purchase, and a standard C SATCOM system through UDEL group purchase (no
              monetary award for LDEO).
