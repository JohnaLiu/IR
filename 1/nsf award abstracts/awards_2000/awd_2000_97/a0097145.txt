Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the University of Houston (UH) for a Summer 2001
              REU Site in Electrical and Computer Engineering under the direction of Dr.
              Frank J. Claydon.  The proposed program will build on the UH "in-house"
              self-funded REU program conducted during Summer 2000.  The program is designed
              to infuse 12 undergraudate students with enthusiasm towards graduate level
              education and careers in research.  At least 50% of these students will
              selected from institutions other than UH.  Institutions with significant
              Hispanic or African-American student populations will be particularly targeted
              for student recruitment.  Each student will undertake a specific research
              project, and a faculty advisor (participating in the REU program) will work
              with the student to develop his/her research skills.  An essential element of
              the program will be its emphasis on professional development of the students
              (e.g., paper writing and technical presentations).
