Abstract    :
              This award is to continue an REU site program at the Geophysical Institute of
              the University of Alaska.  Building on success since 1987, this program will
              give further research opportunities to undergraduates majoring in the physical
              sciences.  The program objective is to acquaint undergraduates with life and
              work at a research institute.  The objective is achieved by providing summer
              educational work opportunities in which undergraduates become interns
              participating in the research activities at the Institute.  Research topics
              concentrate on space physics and aeronomy, but also extend to atmospheric
              science, and in a minor way to solid state physics and laser physics.  Students
              are assigned to conduct research with individual principal investigators who
              direct their work and serve as mentors during their internship.  A common
              program of weekly lectures and field trips is designed to expose interns to
              fields of research beyond the scope of their project.  Through their close
              relationships with their mentors, contacts with graduate students, attendance
              at seminars, lectures, and thesis defenses, and participation in field trips,
              the interns gain a first hand perspective on life and work as a research
              scientist.
