Description:  This award supports participation of a large
              delegation of US natural scientists, social scientists, and policy makers at
              the US-India Workshop: Tropical Ecosystems: Structure, Diversity, and Human
              Welfare, Bangalore, India, July 2001. Co-organizers are Professors Kamaljit
              Bawa, University of Massachusetts Boston and Uma Shaankar, University of
              Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore.  In recent years, knowledge of tropical biota
              and ecosystems has expanded; also, its scope has broadened to include social
              and economic dimensions of land use change and habitat loss.  The goals of the
              conference are to review recent developments in tropical biology including
              management and conservation of ecosystems and to define priorities for future
              research.  A post-conference meeting on Advancing Frontiers in Tropical Biology
              will bring together selected US tropical biologists, their Indian counterparts,
              and graduate students to discuss the latest conceptual and analytical advances,
              and explore collaboration.   

Scope:  This is the first major international
              conference on ecology, conservation and management of tropical ecosystems held
              since 1982 that will define future priorities for tropical biology.  The timing
              capitalizes on new opportunities offered by the rapidly expanding knowledge
              base and new insights on the impact of human induced change on tropical
              ecosystems.  It will involve scientists from the tropics and enable 30 to 40 US
              scientists, postdocs, and graduate students to travel to Bangalore, India where
              they will participate in the conference, post-conference activities, field
              trips and discussions on collaboration.  This award is supported by the
              Division of International Programs and the Division of Environmental Biology.
