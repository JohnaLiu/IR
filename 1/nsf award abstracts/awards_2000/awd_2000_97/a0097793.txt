The objective of this research is the development of a fluorescence
              imaging system for massive parallel DNA sequencing.  This sequencing system
              includes the construction of a chip with immobilized single stranded DNA
              templates that can self prime for the generation of the complementary DNA
              strand in the polymerase reaction.  The system also includes 4 unique
              fluorescently labeled nucleotide analogues with capped by a small chemical
              moiety to allow efficient incorporation into the growing strand of DNA as
              terminators in the polymerase reaction.  A 4-color fluorescence imager is then
              used to identify the sequence of the incorporated nucleotide on each spot of
              the chip.  After removal of the dye photochemically and the capping group, the
              polymerase reaction proceeds to incorporate the next nucleotide analogue and
              detect the next base.  High density (>10,000 spots per chip) single stranded
              DNA will be immobilized on a 4 cm. x 1 cm. glass chip in order to identify more
              than 10,000 bases after each cycle.  After 100 cycles a million base pairs will
              be generated on one sequencing chip.
