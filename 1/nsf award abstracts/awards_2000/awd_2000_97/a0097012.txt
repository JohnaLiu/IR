Abstract    :
              The Florida State Collection of Arthropods (FSCA), one of the largest arthropod
              museums in North America, has 8.18 million prepared specimens and over 3,400
              primary types.  The FSCA has far outgrown its original capacity and presently
              has very large holdings from the southeastern United States,  the
              circum-Caribbean area, South America and Oriental regions.  Most groups
              comprising the FSCA's major taxonomic strengths are beyond current drawer
              capacity, allowing no expansion and little proper curation.  Many thousands of
              pinned and labeled specimens, including many already identified to species, are
              housed off-site and/or in miscellaneous, poorly accessible storage boxes.  With
              adequate cabinet and drawer space, these specimens can be curated and made
              available for research and education.  This project will add about 7000 drawers
              and over 130 cabinets in order fully to use available space in the museum.  It
              will increase the museum's drawer capacity by 48% and allow full incorporated
              of over 1.45 million prepared specimens of Lepidoptera, Dipters, Hemiptera,
              Homoptera, Odonata, and Coleoptera.  This will alleviate urgent space needs of
              the FCSA, house the entire pinned collection in drawers, allow further
              mission-oriented growth, and make valuable material and data available to the
              public and scientific communities.
