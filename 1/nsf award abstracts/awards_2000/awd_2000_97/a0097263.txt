This is a dissertation grant submitted by Dr. Michael Dove,
              Yale University on behalf of his student, Ms. Keely Maxwell. The objective of
              the project is to analyze the dynamic cultural landscape of the Machu Picchu
              Historical Sanctuary, Peru, and investigate how and why people physically and
              ideologically shape its landscape.  This project is being jointly supported
              between the Americas Program and the Geography and Regional Science Program.
              

In collaboration with the Machu Picchu Program in Cuzco,and the University
              of Cuzco San Antonio Abad, the investigators' aim is to understand how and why
              participants' perceptions of, and rights and responsibilities to, trees and
              forests in Machu Picchu differ; how these differences affect resource
              management strategies and outcomes; and how interactions among physical and
              ideological shapings of Machu Picchu cause social and ecological consequences.
              

Results of this research will benefit both countries by promoting
              interdisciplinary discussions regarding how to utilize social theory to analyze
              and resolve protected area problems, and how social theory can better address
              dynamics between social and ecological systems.
