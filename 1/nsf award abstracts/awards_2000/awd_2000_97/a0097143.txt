Abstract    :
              The investigators will continue development of a coupled global
              magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere circulation model and to make it
              accessible to the scientific community.  The model will be expanded to include
              an adaptive mesh and will be made more robust and user friendly.  Extensive
              testing, model-data comparisons, and establishing baseline metrics of the
              model's performance will be an integral part of the development effort.  The
              model results will be made available to the scientific community via the
              Internet, and runs on demand will be executed for selected events.  Data
              analysis and visualization tools are also provided to make optimal use of the
              model.  The project also includes the acquisition, installation, and
              maintenance of a new Beowulf computer cluster at UCLA.  The model will be used
              to study the space weather effects resulting from disturbances in the solar
              wind.  This is important for improving the ability to mitigate the potential
              hazards on technical systems on earth due to solar disturbances.
