Abstract    :

The REU Program in Water Research at CSU recruits up to 15
              outstanding undergraduate students from water-related programs at CSU, from
              other four-year institutions in Colorado and across the nation, and up to 3
              high school teachers to carry out multidisciplinary research in water at CSU.
              The characteristics of the institutions targeted are: 1) they have programs
              that prepare students for water- related careers, 2) they have limited
              opportunities for student research, and 3) they have high percentages of
              students from under-represented groups. Each participant will undertake an
              individual research project under the supervision of a faculty member,
              typically as a member of a group that includes one or more graduate students.
              Students will participate in a series of seminars and discussions by invited
              speakers addressing water issues, including issues of ethics in water
              resources, and other topics of interest. Several field excursions will
              introduce students to some of Colorado's and the U.S.'s most pressing water
              problems.  Students will complete their research during the 8-week summer
              program, preparing a written report and presenting their results orally to
              their peers in an end-of-summer REU symposium/celebration.  Selected students
              will participate in the Fall Water Center Student Symposium, an
              interdepartmental gathering of both undergraduate and graduate students
              undertaking water resources research at CSU.  Finally, all students will be
              invited, expenses paid, to attend CSU's annual AGU Hydrology Days, a
              professional forum held in mid-April each year.
