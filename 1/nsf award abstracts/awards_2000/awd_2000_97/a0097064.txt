Abstract    :
              This SGER award for $30,000 supports a campaign by Boston University scientists
              designed to obtain daytime observations at Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland.  This
              effort would be based upon the application of two sophisticated imaging
              spectrographs designed to make measurements of auroral emissions in the
              presence of the large Rayleigh-scattered continuum of the daytime sky.  These
              measurements would be conducted simultaneously with the Sonderstrom radar
              observations of electron density profiles to obtain a determination of the
              ionospheric conductances in the E-region.  The radar measurements of this
              quantity would be compared with the calculated conductance based upon a model
              that relates E-region electron densities to the energy of precipitating
              particles in aurora that would be inferred from the optical measurements.  This
              effort would establish the feasibility of the daytime application of both
              optical instruments and would also take advantage of the current period of
              solar maximum activity.
