Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              (REU) site at North Carolina State University, where a previous REU site was
              funded for 1997-1999.  Thomas Gunnoe is the site's Program Director; Maria
              Oliver-Hoyo is the Co-Program Director. Twelve faculty will serve as REU
              student mentors.  During the award period (2001-2003), each summer ten students
              will participate in a ten-week program.  Strong emphasis will be placed on
              recruiting students from undergraduate institutions that lack research
              opportunities, using existing relations with many of the HBCUs and PMCUs within
              North Carolina.  In addition, plans are underway to develop relationships with
              selected universities in Puerto Rico.  These relationships will be utilized to
              bolster the program's minority recruiting efforts. The research projects
              offered are in the areas of analytical, inorganic, organic, and physical
              chemistry. While the primary focus of the program will be on the students'
              direct participation in a research project, students will also participate in
              weekly seminars, industrial site visits, safety instruction, and other
              educational and networking activities.  At the conclusion of the program, each
              student will present his/her research at a mini-symposium that will include
              both poster and oral presentations.  Both long- and short-term evaluation
              methods will be implemented to determine the effectiveness of this REU
              program.
