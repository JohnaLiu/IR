Abstract    :
              This is the first year funding of a three year continuing award.   In this
              project, the PI will build upon his prior NSF-funded work to develop computer
              systems capable of operating autonomously in dynamic and uncertain
              environments.   Specifically, the research will focus on three major themes: 
              Qualitative planning under uncertainty using causal and counterfactual
              relationships;   Automatic generation of natural language explanations of
              actions, recommendations, and unexpected eventualities;   Learning causal
              structures from spontaneous changes, to facilitate predictions and decisions in
              data-intensive applications.
