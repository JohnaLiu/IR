Abstract    :
              The Tulane University Fish Collection, with 7.1 million fluid-preserved
              specimens in over 190,000 lots, is one of the largest collections in the world
              and is recognized as a "National Center of Ichthyology resource collection. The
              collection is unique among North American fish collections in having large lot
              sizes and comprehensive regional (southeastern) coverage. Because of the
              collection's high concentration on southeastern fishes, some areas of the
              collection have serious overflow problems.   Fluid specimens in the collection
              are preserved in 50% isopropanol, which many in the fish collection community
              regard as inferior to ethyl alcohol.  One previous (DEB-9401943) and a current
              grant (DBI-9729049) have allowed us to re-curate (re-jar, re-alcohol and
              re-shelve) roughly 112,000 (67%) of the 167,000 lots preserved in isopropyl
              alcohol, and to move large specimens and long-term survey collections to a new
              facility, thereby reducing overcrowding in the main fish collection. The
              decision to re-alcohol the collection was based on reviewer and panel
              recommendations from the first collection improvement grant.  This proposal
              requests support for personnel and supplies to complete curatorial tasks
              currently underway.  Our goals for the renewal grant are: 1) to transfer the
              remaining 55,000 isopropanol preserved lots to 70% ethanol; 2) continue to
              reduce jar sizes to increase shelf space; 3) transfer remaining lots of common
              southeastern species to the overflow storage facility; 4) inventory remaining
              lots against the collection database; and 5) arrange all lots by drainage.
              

By the conclusion of this project, the entire fish collection will be
              re-alcoholed, reorganized and verified against the collection database.  The
              improvements will greatly increase accessibility to material in the collection
              by researchers and curatorial staff, and ensure that preservation quality of
              the collection will remain high for many years to come.  In re-alcoholing the
              collection, we are following procedures recommended by other curators.  We are
              conducting experiments to assess the effectiveness of the alcohol-transfer
              procedures, and modifying procedures as appropriate to increase preservation
              quality.  We will expand this practice in the proposed project as we recurate
              lots that have been compromised most by storage in isopropanol.  We will share
              the results of our experiments with the collection community, through
              professional meeting presentations, publications and the Museum web site.  This
              way others will be able to make use of the re-alcoholing procedures developed
              as a result of this project.
