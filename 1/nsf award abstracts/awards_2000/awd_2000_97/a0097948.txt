Abstract    :
              This project will develop network indicators of industrial R&D collaboration
              from three large databases of inter-firm cooperative agreements and from a set
              of case studies.  The type of networks will include R&D cooperation, joint
              ventures, strategic alliances, etc.  The development of the case studies will
              produce indicators of the factors underpinning network creation and change. 
              Empirical analysis of the databases will yield indicators related to the
              characteristics and properties of network structure.  These networks will be
              presented graphically using network graphing theory.
