Abstract    :
              The award would support the continuation of a numerical modeling study that
              seeks to understand the sources of tidal variability in the mesosphere and
              lower thermosphere (MLT) region.  The steady state Global Scale Wave Model
              would be improved through several upgrades of the basic physics in the forcing
              of atmospheric tides by solar insolation absorption by water vapor, clouds, and
              latent heating.  A Spectral Dynamics Model based upon a nonlinear time
              dependent approach to the solution of the primitive equations would be
              exercised to capture the typical 2-day, 5-day, and 10-day planetary wave events
              to understand the excitation of secondary waves and their impact upon tidal
              variability.
