Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Wyoming.  Dean
              Roddick is the site's Program Director and there will be available 11 faculty
              as REU student mentors.  Over the award period (2001-2003), the students will
              be supported each summer in a ten-week program.  Students will be recruited
              primarily in the West from institutions that do not have Ph.D. programs in
              chemistry, as well as Wyoming Community Colleges.  A particular emphasis will
              be to seek American Indian students.  All students will participate in an
              Undergraduate Research Symposium during the final week by giving a 15 minute
              oral presentation on their research.
