              ABSTRACT

OCE-009738 / OCE-0097327

This project constitutes the management
              component for the second and final phase of the Synthesis and Modeling Program
              (SMP) of the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (U.S.JGOFS).  The overall
              objective of the SMP as defined in the Implementation Plan (U.S. JGOFS, 1997)
              is to "synthesize knowledge gained from the U.S. JGOFS and related studies into
              a set of  models that reflect our current understanding of the oceanic carbon
              cycle"  with emphasis on the processes controlling the partitioning of carbon
              among oceanic reservoirs and  between the ocean and atmosphere. The success of
              the SMP therefore depends heavily on fostering strong interactions between the
              observational and modeling biogeochemical communities and on focusing  those
              efforts in a coordinated fashion. Over the past three years, the SMP has grown
              into a vigorous  scientific effort with some 50 funded projects from NSF, NASA,
              NOAA, and DOE and about 100  principal and co-investigators.  This project will
              therefore support the SMP management team's  involvement in project oversight
              and coordination, ongoing program scientific relevance, development of the 
              required infrastructure, and communication among SMP components and to the
              outside community.
