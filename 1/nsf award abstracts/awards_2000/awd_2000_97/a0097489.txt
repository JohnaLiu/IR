Abstract    :
              Fort Valley State University, an 1890 Land-Grant institution serving a 90-95%
              African-American student population, proposes to initiate a Research Experience
              for Undergraduates (REU) site in biotechnology.  The program will focus
              primarily on encouraging and facilitating research careers and, secondarily,
              assisting students with interests in other science-based careers to appreciate
              the nature of research.  Ten students (women/minorities) selected from small
              colleges will work on research projects with pre-selected mentors in cell
              biology, genetic engineering, tissue culture, molecular genetics, environmental
              sciences, entomology and biochemistry.  The students will also participate in
              seminars, attend workshops, and engage in experiential learning through field
              trips to major research sites.   During the 10-week program, they will complete
              research projects, give oral presentations and submit written abstracts of
              their work.  To promote continued interest in research, two students will be
              nominated for additional research funds to extend their experiences into the
              following school year, and will be eligible for travel funds to present their
              research at scientific meetings.  Program effectiveness will be assessed from
              student exit surveys and a long-term tracking system.  At the formative level,
              the  project will be evaluated by an advisory committee consisting of prominent
              scientists from private industry and research institutions.  Establishing this
              program will have a significant impact on students' decisions to pursue careers
              in biotechnology or biological sciences, and will enhance the university's
              opportunities to support student-centered research.  Toward that end, the
              university has committed partial support and resources to ensure successful
              execution of the REU program.
