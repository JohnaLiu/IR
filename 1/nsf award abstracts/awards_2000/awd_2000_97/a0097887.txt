Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Rowan University, Kauser Jahan, Principal
              Investigator, for the support of a 3-year REU Site Program in Pollution
              Prevention.  This eight-week summer program will involve 9 students with
              backgrounds in Civil/Environmental/Chemical/Electrical Engineering.  This
              research experience will provide students with a unique opportunity to focus on
              fundamental/applied research projects that have significant impacts on human
              health and the environment.  The REU research activities will focus on a single
              unified theme-Pollution Prevention.   The REU Site will strengthen the young
              engineering program at Rowan University, which strongly supports
              curriculum-wide emphasis on quality undergraduate education integrated with
              multidisciplinary research.
