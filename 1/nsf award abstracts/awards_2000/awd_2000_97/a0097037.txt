Mullen

This award supports an 18 month collaborative research
              project between Professor Kieran Mullen, with the Department of Physics and
              Astronomy at the University of Oklahoma, and Professor Jean-Marie Ndjaka, with
              the Department of Physics at the University of Yaounde in Cameroon.
 
              
Professors Mullen and Ndjaka will theoretically investigate the self
              organization and elastic properties of semiconductor nanoscale structures.  The
              project will utilize Professor Mullen's expertise in semiconductor physics and
              Professor Ndjaka's background in magnetic systems and correlated electron
              systems.  This grant will also enable Professor Ndjaka to gain additional
              experience in the applied theory of nanostructure growth.  Anticipated results
              should provide additional support for the experimental study of quantum dots. 
              The project will also foster a long-term collaboration between the two
              universities, which will enhance the research programs at both schools.
