Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports a new Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site at Howard University.  Helen de Clercq is the site's
              Program Director.  Nine faculty will be available to serve as REU student
              mentors.  During the award period (2001-2003), each summer ten students will
              participate in a ten-week program.  Student recruitment will focus on five
              partner institutions that are community colleges in the Washington, DC -
              Baltimore, MD metropolitan area.  No Howard University students will be
              selected for this program. The research projects offered are in the areas of
              analytical, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry.  The summer research
              experience will be supplemented with tours of area laboratories and scientific
              institutions, a tutorial where the students will work on skills necessary to
              succeed as chemistry majors, and introductory seminars on safety, laboratory
              practices, instrumentation and the chemical literature. Students will present
              their research findings at the conclusion of the program both via a poster
              presentation and oral session.  Evaluation of the program will consist of a
              series of quantitative and qualitative measures, including entrance and exit
              tests.  The PI will conduct individual exit interviews with each of the student
              participants.
