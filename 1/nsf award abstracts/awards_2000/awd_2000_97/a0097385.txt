Abstract    :
              This joint Chemistry Division and Division of International Programs award
              supports the continuation of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
              site at the University of Florida.  Randolph Duran is the site's Program
              Director; Michael Scott is the Co-Program Director. Over twenty faculty from
              French institutions are available to serve as REU mentors for U.S. students. 
              During the award period (2001-2003), each summer ten students will travel to
              France to participate in a 10-12 week program at several French institutions,
              including Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, University Montpellier, CNRS
              National Laboratory, and University of Strasbourg.  (Note: Through French
              funding, a similar number of French students, recruited from the same
              institutions, will be doing summer research at the University of Florida.) 
              Recruitment efforts will extend nationwide, targeting more then 80 institutions
              with noted minority enrollments. The research topics for the students will
              center on materials chemistry. A mid-program science workshop will afford
              students the opportunity to hear one or two lectures on a focused topic and to
              interact scientifically.  The student participants will see research performed
              in a different manner and within a different cultural context from the
              traditional U.S. model.  Student participants will conclude the program with a
              project summary presentation at the French institution where the research is
              being done.  An enhanced evaluation of the program will be a longitudinal study
              via interviews and surveys aimed at examining the impact the international
              experience has on students' career choices and cultural attitudes.
