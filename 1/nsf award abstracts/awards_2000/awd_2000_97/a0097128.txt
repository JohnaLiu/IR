The
              deficiency of observed neutrinos emanating from the Sun has been one of the
              most intriguing problems of solar astrophysics in recent years.  Most
              researchers now believe that this is more a consequence of neutrino physics and
              explain the deficiency as a consequence of the transformation of electron
              neutrinos into muon or tau neutrinos as they fly out of the center of the Sun.
              Since the Sun's structure is very stable, the flux of neutrinos should be
              constant. But in arguments that are addressed in this award, the PI and his
              collaborators believe that magnetic fields may play an important part. In
              recent papers, they point out that, if the neutrino has a very small magnetic
              moment, then the magnetic field of the sun, which is not distributed
              isotropically, could modulate the neutron flux by converting left-handed
              neutrinos into right-handed neutrinos which would not be registered by
              terrestrial detectors. The PI and his team support their theory by claiming
              that the neutrino flux from the Sun varies with a period close to the rotation
              period of the deep convection zone. The evidence comes from a sophisticated
              analysis of existing Homestake and GALLEX-GNO data. There are many critics of
              this analysis. The principal effort made in this award will be to address the
              critics by reviewing previous analyses and to make preparations for the study
              of the Super-Kamiokande data and other data sets, as they become
              available.
