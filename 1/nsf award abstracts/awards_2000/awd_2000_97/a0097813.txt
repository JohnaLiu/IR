Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics of Indiana University at Bloomington will host a
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates site during the summers of 2001, 2002,
              and 2003.  Each year eight students will be 
selected from the national pool
              of talented undergraduate mathematics majors to spend eight weeks working on a
              guided research project.  Both individual and small group projects will be
              available and will cover a wide range of topics in pure and applied
              mathematics.  Students will live together for the eight week period in a
              university dormitory.  They will meet regularly with a faculty mentor, will
              present lectures on their work, and write a report on the results of their
              investigations.  In addition to their research, students will 
participate in
              one or two short courses on interesting topics in mathematics that are
              accessible to undergraduates but outside the framework of typical courses.
