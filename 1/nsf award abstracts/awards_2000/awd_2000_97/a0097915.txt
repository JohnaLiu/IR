Abstract    :
              A broad program of research in string theory, the candidate theory of all
the
              basic forces of nature, will be undertaken. The focus will be on
constructing
              string models which naturally accommodate large hierarchies
of scales. This is
              motivated by the observed but mysterious discrepancy
between the spatial scale
              of the weak nuclear force (which is roughly the
size of the nucleus) and the
              scale at which the gravitational force
becomes strong (which is a much shorter
              distance than nuclear sizes).  
This is an important problem because
              understanding how and why these two
very disparate scales occur in nature may
              be a key to uncovering the next
layer of structure of the elementary
              particles.
