REU Sites:  SURFing the Information
              Technology Lab: A NIST-NSF Partnership

The Summer University Research
              Fellowship (SURF) program at the National  Institute for Standards and
              Technology (NIST) was begun by the Physics  Laboratory in cooperation with NSF
              in 1993.  Additional NIST laboratories have added such programs, and its
              youngest lab, Information Technology (ITL), is now doing so. NIST, the second
              oldest federal scientific organization, is a major  working scientific
              organization, with many stimulating projects for undergraduate  participation. 
              Scientists with such projects are given time and resources by NIST to supervise
              the student research.  NSF funds for stipend, travel, and housing expenses go
              to students via their academic institutions, which have submitted names of
              interested students and individual application materials provided by the
              students.  NIST obtains quality summer housing at a level covered by the funds
              granted, provides the project resources, and has an office to administer the
              program, including recruiting through universities.  There is a particular
              stress on outreach to obtain a group as diverse as it is talented.  In addition
              to the individual projects, NIST provides a series of special seminars, many
              run by students who select and invite the speakers.  SURF and post-SURF
              seminars by students on their projects are also expected, and papers or other
              participation at scientific conferences is encouraged.  NIST and its individual
              labs also conduct ongoing reporting and evaluation to assure and increase SURF
              program quality.
