Abstract    :
              One of the best ways to keep undergraduate students excited about science is to
              involve them in actual laboratory research. The opportunity to become a working
              member of an active research group provides the impetus for many students to
              continue into graduate school in science. The NSF REU program at Iowa State
              University focuses on providing an intensive research experience with an active
              research group at Iowa State. The research groups work on biotechnology and
              genomics of plants and animals. Understanding that these types of research
              opportunities are available for undergraduate students at large research
              universities, this program focuses its efforts on students that do not have the
              same research opportunity at their home colleges. Specifically these are
              schools that serve minority institutions (particularly the 1890 Land Grant
              Schools) and small liberal arts colleges in the Midwest. Outstanding students
              that have finished their sophomore or junior years will spend ten weeks on the
              Iowa State University campus where room and board and a stipend are supplied.
              The students will join university research teams that are working in
              laboratories on problems in biotechnology and genomics. The students also meet
              together weekly for lunch and discussions on ethics, diversity, applying to
              graduate schools, written and oral scientific presentations, and frontiers of
              biological research. The students practice writing for general and scientific
              audiences, publish their research on the program web page, and present their
              work at a mini-symposium for the other students, mentors, and colleagues.
