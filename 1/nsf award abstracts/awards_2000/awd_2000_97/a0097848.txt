This award to San Jose State University provides instrumentation
              to update and expand the oceanographic research capabilities of the research
              vessel Point Sur, a ship operated by the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories as
              part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS)
              research fleet.  A new undulating profiler with sensors for biological,
              physical and chemical oceanographic observations will significantly expand the
              ability of marine researchers to study mesoscale processes along the central
              California margin.  New flat-screen monitors and cabinets will improve space
              constraints in the vessel laboratory, and a carousel water sampler will provide
              important backup capability for water sampling.  These improvements will be of
              substantial advantage to marine scientists using the ship in their research
              during 2001 and future years.
