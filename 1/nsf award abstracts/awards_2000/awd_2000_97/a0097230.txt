Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for an REU Site in archaeological research methods in
              Veszto, Hungary.  This is part of a collaborative, multi-disciplinary,
              international research project co-organized by Ohio  State University and the
              Munkacsy Mihaly Museum, Bekescsaba, Hungary.  Ten students will have the
              opportunity to participate in research aimed at understanding the later
              prehistory of the Great Hungarian Plain.  They will help excavate the Early
              Copper Age settlement of Veszto-Bikeri.  They will (1) work side-by-side with
              Hungarian students as they receive instruction in survey and excavation
              techniques; (2) participate in seminars taught by experts on archaeological
              method and theory and on the culture and history of Eastern Europe; (3) visit
              museums and archaeological sites; (4) plan and complete an independent research
              project; and (5) live in the small town of Veszto and learn about life in
              Hungary from the villagers and Hungarian students and archaeologists.  The
              students will be responsible not only for helping excavate the site, but also
              for analyzing archaeological material that will provide a better understanding
              of prehistoric economic and social organization.  They will present papers and
              publish their results on the project website and in archaeological journals. 
              

This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract
              talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research
              experiences.
