This award provides funds for a
              travel grant to partially support United
States participants to attend the
              53rd Session of the International
Statistical Institute (ISI) in Seoul,
              Republic of Korea, from August 22-29,
2001. The ISI meeting is an umbrella
              meeting of a number of international
statistical associations with sessions of
              interest to thousands of
statisticians. The travel grant provides partial
              support to defray
transportation costs for applicants from institutions and
              non-profit
associations. An emphasis of the award is to encourage and provide
              the
opportunity for younger statisticians to participate in the meeting.
              Special
consideration will be given to statisticians who have received their
              Ph.D.
in 1991 or later and to women and minorities.
