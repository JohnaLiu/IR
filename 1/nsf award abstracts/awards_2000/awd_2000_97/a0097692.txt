Abstract    :
              The University of Kentucky operates a Research Experience for Undergraduates
              (REU) to introduce students to research in functional polymeric membranes and
              composite materials. Ten undergraduate students are recruited every year for a
              two-month summer research experience, with a recruitment focus on students from
              colleges and universities that serve the Appalachian region.  In addition to
              research activities, students attend weekly seminars and are offered the
              opportunity to participate in a professional conference during the academic
              year.
