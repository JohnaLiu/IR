The objective of this research is the development of new
              fluorescence-based sensors with high sensitivity and accuracy for important
              industrial analytes for which current chemical sensors are inadequate or
              nonexistent.  In earlier work the investigators demonstrated that carbonic
              anhydrase-based biosensors were capable of transducing the levels of certain
              transition metals as changes in fluorescence intensity, lifetime, and
              anisotropy.  These sensors were able to rapidly and continuously determine
              transition metal ions such copper and zinc at sub-part per billion levels in
              the presence of calcium and magnesium at million-fold higher concentrations. 
              In this research the metal ion approach will be extended for the detection of
              the heavy metals lead, mercury and cadmium.  The bulk of the engineering effort
              in this phase of the research will occur at the molecular level, in the
              construction of the fluorescent transducer/recognition molecules and
              determination of their properties.  In addition, a previously developed
              approach, which uses fluorescence lifetime to detect anions such as cyanide and
              cyanate, will be adapted for the determination of the anions chromate,
              arsenate, and nitrate.
