The past decade has witnessed a revolution in the data
              available on the diffuse interstellar medium, with a variety of techniques and
              a variety of wavelengths.  With new radio telescopes at the Arecibo Observatory
              and Green Bank, West Virginia, the next few years will see an explosion in
              quality 21-cm spectral line data on atomic hydrogen.  Dr. Carl Heiles, at the
              University of California at Berkeley, will emphasize observations of this 21-cm
              line with both of these telescopes, and together with a variety of datasets,
              will attempt to produce a complete, comprehensive picture of the interstellar
              medium in our Galaxy.
