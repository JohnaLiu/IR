Title: Understanding Object-Oriented Software
              Design Evolution in the Extreme 
Programming Process

Abstract

Extreme Programming (XP) is a new software
              process emphasizing source code
as the main communication medium and software
              testing as the quality
assurance mechanism. This research studies
              object-oriented (OO) software
design evolution and examines the predictive
              capability of software metrics
in the XP process by using carefully logged
              design-change data on two
commercial Java systems developed using an
              XP-like
process with daily (working day) log on the design change and the
              change
effort. This project analyzes the collected data and investigates how
              class
design, as measured by metrics such as CTA, CTM, NLM, WMC, and LCOM,
              evolves
from one story to the next: i.e. if they show continuous growth or
              otherwise. The
project also studies if the OO metrics collected at the end of
              an iteration
cycle can predict the refactoring, error-fix, and new design
              efforts in the
next cycle by using multiple linear regression. The result from
              this study
helps us understand how customer requirements, which come in small
              chunks
(stories) from the customer in the XP process, affect software
              design
change.
