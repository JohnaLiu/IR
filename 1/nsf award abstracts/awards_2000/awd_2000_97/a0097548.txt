Abstract    :
              The University of Michigan will conduct an NSF/REU program during the summer of
              2001 at CERN. CERN is the European Laboratory for Particle Physics and it
              straddles the border between Switzerland and France just outside Geneva.  It is
              the foremost facility of its kind in the world, and the Michigan REU Site at
              CERN is designed to give ten U.S. science and engineering undergraduates the
              opportunity to participate in an international setting. This program will
              stress strong minority recruitment through direct contact with HBCU's and other
              REU programs as well as the deployment of state of the art web based achieving
              technologies to make the CERN summer lectures available to other U.S. REU
              sites.  At CERN the U.S. students join a select group of international physics
              students and participate in a variety of educational and social activities. 
              Although the US is not an official member state of CERN, the US students are
              treated exactly the same as member state students and they can enjoy the
              benefits of being a CERN Summer Student.  Activities include: attending
              lectures by experts in a variety of fields in physics, engineering and
              computing; working with and learning from world-renowned physicists;
              collaborating on multi-national research projects including CMS and ATLAS at
              the Large Hadron Collider.  This unique opportunity not only allows the
              students to learn fundamental physics in a research environment, but it also
              gives them the benefit of working in an international setting.
