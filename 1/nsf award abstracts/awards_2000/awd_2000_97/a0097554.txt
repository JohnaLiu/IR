Abstract    :
              The American Mathematical Society will administer the program for selecting and
              supporting approximately eight U.S. mathematics graduate students and two
              senior U.S. mathematicians to attend the European Summer
School at the Euler
              International Mathematical Institute in St. Petersburg, Russia.  The theme of
              this summer school is asymptotic combinatorics, with applications to
              mathematical physics.  The summer school will take place July, 2001, and is
              sponsored by the European Mathematical Society.  The grant from the National
              Science Foundation in the amount of $20,520 will be used for travel and
              subsistence for the selected individuals.  This is an opportunity for
              substantial cooperation between the American and European mathematics
              communities.
