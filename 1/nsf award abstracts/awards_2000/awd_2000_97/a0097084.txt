Abstract    :
              This ocean science technology development project will design and implement a
              cost-efficient and easy-to-operate, multiple rock corer and deep sea camera
              system that will have wide application for ocean floor imaging and sampling. 
              It will be made available on UNOLS research vessels. The core of the system is
              based on standard CTD equipment and .322" coaxial conducting cable and winches
              which are familiar to all UNOLS ships and technicians. The purpose of the
              multi-corer/camera is to take multiple cores during a lowering while at the
              same time collecting digital photographs of the seafloor being sampled. The
              system uses a proven self-recording digital camera system, a CTD pylon for
              triggering each corer, and a pressure sensor and altimeter, that are commonly
              integrated with CTD units for determining depth altitude off bottom. The
              multi-corer/camera will permit 20 rock cores to be taken on each lowering, with
              digital photographs taken every ~10 sec.  The imaging system will be easily
              transformable for use with a fiber optic hydrographic cable and direct
              telemetry of the images to the surface once fiber optic hydrographic cables are
              introduced on UNOLS ships.
