Abstract    :
              The Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Program at the University of Kentucky
              was
established to provide a summer (10 week) research opportunity for
              highly
qualified undergraduates from non-tier 1 institutions interested
              in
attending graduate school.  The program seeks to; 1) provide an
              interactive
environment where undergraduates are exposed to the many facets of
              a
graduate career (teaching, learning, research), 2) inform
              interested
undergraduates of the many possible careers available to them in
              the
neurosciences, and 3) immerse students in a research project of their
              own
choosing.  Faculty from a wide cross-section of the neurosciences,
              including
molecular, behavioral and physiological, will offer their expertise
              to
mentor students in their laboratories and participate in an
              intensive
neuroscience short course.  Students will have many opportunities
              to
interact both socially and professionally by attending a
              neuroscience
symposia as well as numerous social events scheduled to
              enhance
collegiality.  By the end of the summer, students who are
              generally
otherwise unable to experience hands-on neuroscience research, will
              have
completed their own project, presented it to a professional audience,
              taken
an intensive neuroscience short course, gained a deeper understanding of
              the
day-to-day work environment of the neuroscientist, been exposed to
              the
multitude of career options open to a graduate, and in general become a
              more
committed future graduate student.
