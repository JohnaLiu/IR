Abstract    :
              The REU at Tulane in the summer of 2002 will involve 6 students and 2 .faculty
              members (Kalka and Yang) in research in differential geometry.   The students
              will be broken up into 2 groups of 3 students, each group working with one of
              the faculty members, according to level of preparation and interests.  
              Students will meet regularly with the faculty member and more often with each
              other.   There will be a weekly seminar where each group will give a short
              presentation on their work.   The students will be housed on campus, with
              housing supplied by Tulane and will each receive a stipend of $3000.
