Abstract    :
              
Beginning in the summer of 2001, Clark Atlanta University will offer summer
              research experiences for ten undergraduate students in the areas of cellular
              and molecular biology and biological chemistry.  Undergraduate students from
              Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the Southeastern United
              States will primarily be recruited as applicants for this program.  Junior and
              senior students recruited into the program will be involved in basic biological
              and chemical research in the laboratories of faculty members who are
              experienced in the training and mentoring of undergraduate students.  The
              purpose of this research training will be to expose students from small,
              non-research oriented schools to approaches to some of the most critical
              research problems of today and to state-of-the-art instrumentation.  Projects
              on which students will work range from investigations on  the phenomenon of
              signal transduction in mammalian cells to discoveries of new synthesis
              techniques for chiral compounds.   With these types of exposure, the students
              will not only gain new scientific knowledge and have their classroom lectures
              reinforced, but they can also learn firsthand about the career possibilities
              available in the research arena.
