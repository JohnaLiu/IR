Abstract    :
              The International Union of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) will hold its General
              Assembly and the XXXIV International Congress of Physiological Sciences in
              Christchurch, New Zealand, August 26-31,2001.  In order to encourage the
              participation of U.S. physiologists in the XXXIV Congress, the American
              Physiological Society will administer a travel grant program, offering a
              limited number of travel awards to qualified scientists.  Special emphasis will
              be given to new investigators and to female and under-represented minority
              scientists.  The US National Committee of the IUPS will establish the screening
              and selection committee, and the American Physiological Society will serve as
              the fiscal agent and award the travel grants.  The funds provided by the
              National Science Foundation will help to support approximately 16 new, female,
              and/or under-represented minority scientists.  The overall goal of the travel
              program is to provide assistance to colleagues to attend the XXXIV Congress, to
              encourage the participation of women, young and underrepresented minority
              scientists in the Congress, and to provide opportunities for the development of
              collaborative interactions with scientists from the Australasian region.
