Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the University of Pittsburgh, Mohammed Ataai,
              Principal Investigator for the support of a 3-year REU Site in Chemical
              Engineering.  Fifteen undergraduate students will participate in a 10-week
              summer program which will introduce them to research activities and hands-on
              laboratory experimentation under the  direct supervision of a faculty mentor. 
              The experience will be enriched by seminars and visits to industrial
              laboratories, as well as extracurricular social interacitons.  It is
              anticipated that the program will help the students appreciate the need for a
              comprehensive education with sufficient depth and breadth; make more informed
              decisions about the remainder of their undergraduate courses; and evaluate
              graduate education and career options.
