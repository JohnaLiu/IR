Abstract    :
              The NSF-REU Site in Physics at San Jose State University, a modern comprehensive
              California State University campus,  has operated on a year-round basis since
              1989, has high minority and female participation, and draws from a large pool
              of well-qualified undergraduate Physics majors.  Most of the ongoing research
              projects are in the areas of optics, condensed matter, and computational
              physics - areas that represent the major scientific focus in high-tech Silicon
              Valley surrounding our campus.  These on-going projects provide both
              experimental and theoretical research experiences for undergraduates in
              Physics.  Our summer program serves under-represented students from
              universities other than San Jose State, and part of our program provides
              support for students in industry-university partnerships.  These partnerships
              consist of a Physics faculty member, a physicist from an industry or government
              laboratory, and an NSF-REU student participant.  This part of our program
              fosters important collaborations and facilitates technology transfer to the
              commercial sector.  Research results are reported with, in some cases, student
              participants as co-authors.  In addition, formal presentations by students are
              made at weekly REU meetings of students, faculty, and industrial scientists.
