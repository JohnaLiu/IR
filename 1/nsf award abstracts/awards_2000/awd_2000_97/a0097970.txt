Abstract    :
              This research proposal will examine and analyze several distinct
              commercialization strategies of universities by exploring the relationships
              between six measures in this area.  The base data set links patent
              bibliographic information, licensing data, institutional measures of research
              and training capacity, and indicators of scientific reputation for U.S.
              research universities.  It will also analyze the relationship between the
              technological composition of academic patent portfolios and the degree and
              character of commercial accomplishment at universities.
