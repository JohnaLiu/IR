Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports a new Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates site at the University of Southern Mississippi.  Jeffrey Evans
              is the site's Program Director and he will be assisted by at least 12 faculty
              in the department offering a wide variety of research opportunities for
              undergraduates.  Over the award period (2001-2003), ten students will be
              supported each summer in a ten-week program. The objective of this project is
              to provide research experience for minority undergraduates in Chemistry and
              Biochemistry.  Recruitment efforts will be both within the State of Mississippi
              and adjoining states with special emphasis on attracting minority students. 
              During the summer there will be weekly research presentations and discussions
              of ethics in science, graduate school and GRE preparation.  The final week in
              the summer will include a symposium.
