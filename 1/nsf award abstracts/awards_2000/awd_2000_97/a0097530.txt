Abstract    :
              Founded in 1993, the REU at Louisiana State University is intended for advanced
              undergraduates from all national demographic groups. Our REU represents a
              modest step in the effort to help alleviate the current and projected national
              shortage of scientific and technological workers by providing access for all
              demographic groups to participate in the excitement and challenge of current
              mathematical research. The REU will focus on
current research topics in 
              number theory, geometry and topology (particularly braids, knots and links).
              For summer, 2001, the theme will be: Counting problems and zeta functions in
              number theory, geometry and
topology.  Further details are available on our
              web site: http://www.math.lsu.edu/REU/.

The program is designed for eight
              weeks during the summer with twelve students divided among three faculty
              mentors.  Some basic features of the REU include: cluster housing in student
              apartments on the LSU campus
and daily afternoon teas to foster interaction 
              and promote group cohesion; intial introductory lectures and individual
              meetings with the mentors during the first two weeks, after which the students
              group themselves into cohorts of four students working with a mentor on
              individual but closely-related projects.  Communication of mathematics is
              fostered both informally and formally with an oral project description given
              early in the summer and final oral and written presentations.
