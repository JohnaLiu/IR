Abstract    :
              OPP-0097753

An interdisciplinary pilot study will develop a Geographic
              Information System (GIS) model by layering ethnographic, historic, biological,
              and geologic data to identify significant archaeological finds in areas holding
              high potential for preservation and discovery: frozen areas in Alaska's
              Wrangell-St. Elias Park and Preserve. The Wrangell-St. Elias Park and Preserve
              contains receding glaciers that historically were used on a regular basis by
              early people for transportation and hunting. The archaeological survey will
              field-test locales identified using GIS, provide data to refine the model, and
              obtain information essential for future, more comprehensive use of satellite
              imagery to identify distinctive visual and infrared signatures of ice fields
              most likely to contain archaeological remains.
