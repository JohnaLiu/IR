Stellar winds play an essential role in removing
              excess angular momentum from a recently formed star. During this award there
              will be further development of some critical diagnostics for testing a model of
              winds driven by the magnetocentrifugal interaction of a strongly magnetized
              central star and its surrounding disk. The ultimate goal is to detect the
              co-existence of a wide-angle wind component and a highly collimated central jet
              which is predicted by the model. This is a Collaborative Research project in
              which two PI s share common interests in understanding the role of molecular
              clouds in star formation and whose scientific expertise is complementary. Frank
              Shu, at the University of California, Berkeley focuses more on the dynamical
              aspects of the outflow while Alfred Glassgold, at New York University,  pays
              more attention to the microscopic physics. Loose collaborations have been
              established with observers in order to be able to make detailed comparisons of
              the models with the spectroscopic observations of the collimated outflows.
