Abstract    :
              A conference on Automorphic Forms will be held at the Institute for Advanced
              Study on April 4 - 7, 2001.  Leaders in the field will conduct a formal review
              of the subject, focusing on automorphic forms, L functions and representation
              theory with some clarification as to what the serious problems are, where the
              difficulties lie, and which methods are promising.
