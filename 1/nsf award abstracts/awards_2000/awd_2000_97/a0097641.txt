Abstract    :
              This work aims at a unified treatment of radiative corrections in neutral atoms,
              using both perturbative approaches (exploiting nonrelativistic QED) and a full
              nonperturbative treatment of the electron propagator. Studies will focus on the
              two loop Lamb shift, but will also address radiative binding corrections in
              cesium (relevant both for PNC and for hyperfine splitting) and energy
              calculations in helium and helium-like ions.
