Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at California Polytechnic State University, San
              Luis Obispo will provide opportunities for summer research for up to ten
              undergraduates.  Recruitment will take place nationwide, but our recruitment
              will be focused on students from universities in California.  The research
              emphasis will be in the fields of operator theory and combinatorics.  The
              students will attend seminars with participating faculty and work individually
              with faculty, many of whom have experience doing research with undergraduates.
              The students will also have the opportunity to work collaboratively with and
              give talks to their peers, as well as write a final report with their research
              results.  The program will run for eight weeks, and should be compatible with
              both a quarter system and a semester system.
