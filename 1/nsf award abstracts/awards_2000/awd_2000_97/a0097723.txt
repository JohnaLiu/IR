Abstract    :
              This award provides for NSF support for the Symposium on "New Methodologies in
              Polymer Synthesis" at Pacifichem 2000, to be held in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA,
              Dec. 14-19, 2000.  The symposium is intended to bring together leading polymer
              chemists, as well as young scientists, in the Pacific Rim countries to update
              their new results in order to achieve the following symposium objectives: (1)
              to showcase important trends in polymer synthesis and (2) to promote progress
              in polymer synthesis.
%%%
Major topics to be addressed are (1) polymerization
              of monomers and intermediates, (2) novel polymerization processes, (3)
              metal-catalyzed polymerizations, and (4) sol-gel networks.
