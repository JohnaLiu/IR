Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research
              Experiences for Undergraduates site at the Department of Chemistry at the
              University of Puerto Rico.  The Program Director is Ana Guadalupe.  She is
              assisted by 15 faculty researchers.  For each of the three summers
              (2001-2003)10 students will be involved in the 8-week program.The program
              emphasizes "hands-on experience in modern chemical instrumentation."  The
              instrumentation includes an NMR spectrometer, mass spectrometer, FTIR
              spectrometer and X-ray diffractometer.  The program provides a number of
              support systems including instrumentation workshops and seminars on graduate
              studies and ethics in science.  Each summer program terminates with the
              students presenting their results at a symposium.
