Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Louisiana State University, for a three year REU
              site program in Tomography in Civil and Environmental Engineering, under the
              direction of Dr. Roger K. Seals.  This program will be held each summer for 10
              weeks, for 10 undergraduate students and will focus on research activities and
              training in the use of tomographic techniques in civil and environmental
              engineering.
