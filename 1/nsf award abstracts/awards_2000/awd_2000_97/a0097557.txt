Abstract    :
              This award provides a 3-year award to Clemson University for a REU Site in
              Wireless Communication Networks, Antennas and Propagation, and Radio Frequency
              Circuits, under the direction of Dr. Daniel Noneaker.  This program is designed
              to give10 undergraduate participants each summer an opportunity to develop an
              in-depth understanding of a significant research problem in wireless
              communications. Each student will pursue ten weeks of directed research in the
              areas of communications systems, mobile communication networks, broadband
              antenna design and characterization, and RF and millimeter-wave circuit design.
