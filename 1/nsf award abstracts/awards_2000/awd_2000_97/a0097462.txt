Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the chemical kinetics mechanisms involved in gas
              phase biogenic reactions.  The goal of the project is to develop a predictive
              model for hydrocarbon aerosol formation as a result of biological gas phase
              emissions.  Currently, biogenic aerosol formation is represented in modeling
              efforts based on empirically determined parameters.  Biogenic aerosols can
              contribute both to visibility loss on a local scale and to climate forcing
              effects on a regional scale.  The project will involve a number of outdoor
              chamber experiments to measure terpene gas and particle phase reaction products
              in the presence of light and nitrogen oxides over a specified temperature range
              to develop a sequence of kinetic expressions to model aerosol formation.
