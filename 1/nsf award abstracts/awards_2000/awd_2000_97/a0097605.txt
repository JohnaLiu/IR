Abstract    :
              Columbia University will provide an REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates)
              Site at the high energy physics Nevis Lab located on the campus of Columbia
              University.  Stipend and housing expenses will be furnished for 10
              undergraduate students, for the 10 week summer research program. The broad
              Nevis research program seeks to address the most pressing issues of high energy
              physics.  The major research programs include the ATLAS experiment, D0,
              NuTeV/BooNE, ZEUS, and HiRes experiments. The strength of this broad
              experimental program, coupled with the Nevis infrastructure of world class
              electronics design and mechanical construction, forms a unique environment with
              opportunities for training of students and young physicists.  As these
              experiments are at different stages in their development, Nevis provides the
              opportunity for students to gain experience in all aspects of high energy
              physics experiments, from initial conceptual detector design, hardware
              development and construction, to simulation software development and data
              analysis.
