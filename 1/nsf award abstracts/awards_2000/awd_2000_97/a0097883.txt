Abstract    :
              The conference, to be held in June 2001 in Charleston, SC, will focus on
              computational procedures for developing and studying the network of connections
              between proteins.  The networks of connections between proteins in genomes have
              to be built by a combination of experimental studies, knowledge-based methods,
              sequence analysis and structural approaches that are both fast and insensitive
              to inaccuracies.  The Advisory Committee is committed to attending the
              conference, which will be on the order of 100 participants.  The PI is
              committed to involving junior researchers and under-represented groups as
              speakers and participants in this conference.
