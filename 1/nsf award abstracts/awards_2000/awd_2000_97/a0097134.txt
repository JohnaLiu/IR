Abstract    :
              This goal of this project is to uncover the fundamental aspects of the
              biophysics associated with synchronization in small groups of neurons.   The
              question will be addressed both in the biological laboratory as well as using
              numerical and electronic simulations of the neurons seen in the lab.  The
              research will add to the understanding of how biological nervous systems can
              process information from the environment and pass it on in a coherent way to
              decision making centers.  The work, while in small nervous systems of
              invertebrates, will directly bear on how more complex systems can organize to
              produce interesting functional behaviors.  During the course of the project,
              graduate students and postdoctoral researchers from Physics and Biology will
              work side-by-side and will learn about the biological sciences as well as the
              physical processes underlying the biological activity.
