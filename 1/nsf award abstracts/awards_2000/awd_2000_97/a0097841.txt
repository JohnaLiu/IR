The PI proposes
              to develop colloid-based flow control devices capable of sensing and actuating
              using optical trapping techniques.  Micro-sized check valve, directional valve,
              and colloid pump are to be built based on single colloidal particles to effect
              flow control.  These devices will have broad applications in biological and
              engineering systems.
