Abstract    :
              This award provides continued funding for a 5-year REU Site for Novel
              Technologies for Pollution Prevention, at the University of South Carolina at
              Columbia, under the direction Dr. Michael D. Amiridis.  This 10-week summer
              program will provide 11chemical engineering undergraduate students, from other
              institutions, with research experiences obtained from projects focusing on the
              development of new technologies with positive environmental impact.  Each
              student will be assigned a faculty member as her/his research mentor.  It is
              anticipated that the students will be grouped into larger research teams in the
               following areas: Catalytic, Separation, and Electrochemical Technologies.  In
              addition, the students will tour industrial sites, attend weekly seminars,
              workshops on graduate studies and ethics in science and engineering, and
              participate in a final symposium as well as social activities.
