Abstract    :
              Cornell University operates a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site
              affiliated with its NSF-funded Materials Research Science and Engineering
              Center. The REU Site offers research opportunities for undergraduate students
              in a wide variety of materials-related topics; the understanding and control of
              materials in the nanoscale is the common thread of the research programs.
              Twenty undergraduate students are recruited every year for a ten-week summer
              research experience. The REU Site actively promotes the participation of women
              and students from underrepresented groups and from predominantly undergraduate
              institutions.
In addition to participating in individual research projects,
              students attend weekly technical seminars and career workshops, and participate
              in collective social activities.

Through participation in the summer
              activities, students in the program are afforded a wider perspective on
              research than they might see as part of their regular undergraduate studies. 
              This familiarity with different perspectives on scientific research helps them
              to understand the many different pathways leading to a career in science and
              engineering research.
