Abstract    :
              This award provides renewed funding to support the Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) program at Western Washington University's Shannon Point
              Marine Center (SPMC) during the summers of 2001-2005. The program will support
              eight students each summer for a total of nine weeks during which they will
              work with mentors on independent research projects. Students will be recruited
              nationally, with special attention given to institutions without research
              opportunities for undergraduates and institutions without ready access to
              marine environments. The goal of the program is to provide students the
              opportunity to engage in research that is both effectively supervised and
              independent, in the sense that each project's objectives are distinct,
              identifiable and can be brought to conclusion during the course of the program.
              Most research topics will focus on the local coastal marine and estuarine
              environments, including productivity, biogeochemistry, microbial ecology, water
              quality issues, and chemical ecology. The proposal is based on the theory that
              mentoring and networking are the most effective methods for recruiting students
              into a profession and for training young researchers. This program is well
              designed to encourage highly motivated students to continue the their pursuit
              of research careers in oceanography. Students conduct independent research and
              produce oral and written reports at the end of the internship that may lead to
              publications in research journals. The program will encourage a diverse set of
              forty students to continue their education in the field of oceanography. In the
              past the program has had more than 50% female participants, has drawn students
              from across the nation, and has attracted an ethnically diverse group of
              students.
