Abstract    :
              This research project, carried out in the Department of Chemistry at the
              University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, works to develop an understanding
              of the growth and phase evolution of metallic and intermetallic
              microstructures. Professor Ralph Nuzzo and his colleagues are probing the roles
              played by nucleation, surface chemistry, and dynamics in controlling the
              morphology of CVD grown thin films.  With the support of the Analytical and
              Surface Chemistry Program, pattern formation in these materials over various
              length scales are being examined, with a focus on patterning by soft
              lithography and self-assembly.  Complex assemblies of functional materials,
              useful as chemically active force transducers are being developed. 

An
              understanding of the growth and development of material microstructures is
              essential to the controlled design of functional materials.  This research
              project, with the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
              addresses questions of the mechanism of thin film growth and resulting
              morphology.  Complex mesoscale structures are synthesized and characterized,
              with an eye toward application in chemically active force transduction.
