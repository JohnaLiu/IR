Abstract    :
              This is the first year funding of a three year continuing award.  The PI will
              build a knowledge-based system capable of carrying out commonsense reasoning in
              the domain of rigid solid objects.  For example, such a system would be able to
              reason that a table with one leg shorter than the others will wobble, or that a
              door locked with a dead-bolt can be opened from the side with the bolt, but not
              from the opposite side.  The design of such a system will involve a variety of
              different issue that have not received much attention in previous work on
              automated physical reasoning, including:   reasoning about gross behavior over
              extended periods of time, while ignoring differential behavior over local time;
               reasoning using the kinds of partial spatial information that is relevant in
              this domain;  the use of rough estimates of likelihood and of comparative
              likelihoods;  reasoning about collections of an indeterminate number of
              objects;  and integrating reasoning using rules of varying degrees of
              specificity and certainty.   The success of the system will be evaluated using
              a hand-crafted corpus of some hundreds of examples.   The study of these
              inferences and the development of this system will yield important insights,
              not only into the epistemic and computational structure of this important
              domain, but also into issues of more general interest in the construction,
              extension, and evaluation of large knowledge-based systems for semantically
              rich domains.
