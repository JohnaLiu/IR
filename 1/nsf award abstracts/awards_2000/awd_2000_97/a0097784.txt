Abstract    :
              Louisiana State University (LSU) supports a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site at its synchrotron radiation laboratory, the Center
              for Advanced Microstructures and Devices (CAMD). Ten students are recruited
              nationwide every year for a ten-week summer research experience, with a
              recruitment focus on students from the state of Louisiana and from surrounding
              states.  Undergraduates from many disciplines, including physical, computer and
              biological sciences and engineering are targeted.  Students participate in a
              variety of research projects within three major categories: basic and applied
              science research (x-ray spectroscopy of materials) and microfabrication (x-ray
              lithography).

The program at LSU provides non-LSU undergraduates a unique
              opportunity to participate in research in a modern, large facility.   It also
              provides the opportunity for enhancing synchrotron-based undergraduate research
              at other colleges and universities by involving faculty from the students' home
              institution through a 'Home Mentor' program.
