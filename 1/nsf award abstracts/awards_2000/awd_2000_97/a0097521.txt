The objective of this research is the development of an
              implantable strain sensor and appropriate measurement system to monitor real
              time spinal fusion rod strain.  As the spine fuses, the load is transferred
              from the rod to the spine.  Therefore, the monitored strain on the rod surface
              should decrease over time.  The load transfer for a normal spinal fusion should
              be gradual and steady, and any deviation of discontinuity would indicate either
              non-fusion or possible failure of the rod or pedicle screw.   A complete
              measurement system including microstrain sensors, signal conditioning,
              battery-free telemetry, sensor housing and an external receiver will developed
              and then tested using whole cadavers.  Micromechanical systems (MEMS)
              technology will be implemented to produce a miniature strain sensor.  Two
              integrated circuits (ICs), a MOSFET switch and a LC antenna tank circuit placed
              on a multi-chip module (MCM) board will provide strain sensor signal
              conditioning and telemetry transmission.  The sensor and electronics housing
              will be developed using advanced mechanical design methods combined with rapid
              prototyping using selective laser sintering.  Measurement system verification
              will be conducted using whole cadavers and surgical implantation of the fusion
              rod strain sensors.  The lumbo-sacral spine segment will be removed from the
              cadavers and tested using a MTS Bionix test system to determine system
              sensitivity.
