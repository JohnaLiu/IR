Abstract    :
              This grant  establishes  at Central Michigan University a Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates site.  During Summer 2002, eight students recruited
              nationwide will be actively engaged in mathematical research during the
              eight-week program.  The primary objective is to stimulate talented
              undergraduate students to pursue graduate work in science and mathematics by
              providing accessible and challenging research problems in mathematics.  Typical
              problem areas include a 'sign game' on projective planes, Laplacian spectrum of
              graphs, Schur stability of matrices, and divisible difference sets.  

Three
              faculty members will coordinate the effort.  Students will work in groups of
              two with one faculty mentor.  Students will make presentations of their
              progress during weekly seminars.  Each student will submit a written report at
              the end of the program.  Students will be encouraged to publish their work and
              make presentations at professional meetings.  Every effort will be made during
              recruitment process to attract applications from students in under-represented
              groups.  

To complement the research experience, a number of enrichment
              activities have been planned.  An ethics workshop, led by members of the
              Philosophy and Religion Department, will enable student participants to begin
              considering ethical issues related to research in the sciences, particularly in
              mathematics.  A day trip to Dow Chemical or Ford Motor will provide some
              exposure to mathematics in the workplace.  A weekend trip to Mackinac Island
              will provide a broader historical perspective on the state of Michigan.
