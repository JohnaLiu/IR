Abstract    :
                 An important compound involved in reproduction in all vertebrate species is
              gonadotropin-releasing hormone, GnRH.  This peptide is produced in nerve cells
              of the brain, and regulates synthesis and release of pituitary hormones, which
              in turn stimulate ovulation.  The ancestral mammal was a shrew-like animal, and
              some shrew species today still lack an ovarian or behavioral estrous cycle, and
              puberty is initiated by mating rather than by ovarian hormones as in most other
              mammals.  In a species called the musk shrew, the first mating triggers rapid
              changes in GnRH in the forebrain, and multiple matings initiate ovulation. 
              Shrews have very high metabolism, are largely solitary 'opportunistic'
              breeders, and reproduction is further regulated by local environmental
              conditions, particularly food availability, independent of sex hormone cycles. 
              In many mammals including primates, there are at least two forms of GnRH, and
              one may primarily regulate ovulation, and the other may regulate behavior. This
              project uses immunocytochemical and molecular techniques with the musk shrew as
              a unique model to explore novel issues of how mating and food intake affect the
              functions of the two forms of GnRH in the brain, to regulate sexual behavior
              and puberty. 
    The impact of this work will extend beyond neuroscience to
              reproductive endocrinology, and to comparative and evolutionary biology.  In
              addition, this project will support a unique animal colony as a national
              resource, and will support student training in neuroendocrinology.
