Abstract    :
              This project has two components: (1) an investigation of possible signatures of
              violations of fundamental symmetries in atomic systems; (2) the structure and
              evolution of Rydberg wave packets and their behavior in external fields.  The
              analysis of signatures of Lorentz and CPT violation will be extended to
              additional atomic systems and to other symmetries.  The continued studies of
              Rydberg atoms will involve developing new techniques for studying wave packets
              and revivals in nonintegrable systems.
