Abstract    :
              The Essig Museum of Entomology at the University of California Berkeley is a
              major repository of insect and other terrestrial arthropod specimens from the
              New World, especially California and adjacent regions in western North America.
               It has had a long-term research focus on the eastern Pacific Rim and Pacific
              Islands.  It is one of the largest university entomological museums in the
              country and has served a critical role in the training of systematists over the
              last century.

The current project will upgrade and move the Essig Museum
              collection into new space in the Vertebrate Life Sciences Building.  This will
              allow the consolidation of the natural history museums on campus, providing
              better integration of technical support, outreach, and administration as well
              as scientific research and training.  The new space will allow for several
              decades of expansion of the Essig collections.
