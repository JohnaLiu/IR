Description:  This award supports US-India Cooperative
              Research: Geometric Invariants for Quotient Modules.  US PI Ronald Douglas,
              Texas A&M University and Gadadhar Misra, Indian Statistical Institute,
              Bangalore will study geometric invariants of Hilbert modules over function
              algebras.  The project will lead to a better understanding of multivariate
              operator theory and the cross-fertilization of operator theory with Hermitian
              algebraic geometry.  It is a fundamental problem that has as its objective the
              classifying of quotient Hilbert modules via geometric invariants.  Progress
              toward the goal of finding complete unitary invariants and deepening the
              connection between multivariable operator theory and complex geometry would be
              a significant advance. 
Scope: Douglas and Misra are distinguished
              mathematicians with established research  records.  Douglas is a world leader
              in the interaction between operator theory and several fields of mathematics;
              Misra is a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences.  They have worked
              successfully in the past and have sustained much of their research through
              electronic contact.  They are now at a stage where direct contact is needed to
              proceed with their groundbreaking work.  Both investigators lead groups that
              will be strengthened through this collaboration, which also includes support
              for an exchange of young scientists.  This award is jointly supported by the
              Division of International Programs and the Division of Mathematical Sciences.
