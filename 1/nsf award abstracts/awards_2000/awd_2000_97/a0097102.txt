Abstract    :
              Professor Maryanne Collinson of Kansas State University is supported by the
              Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program for research focused on templated
              sol-gel materials for sensor applications.  The plan is to design and
              synthesize mesoporous and macroporous thin films, to characterize their
              properties at the molecular scale, and to understand the factors that influence
              material response and selectivity.  Macroporous silicate films and
              organic/inorganic hybrid films involving organosilicon precursors will be
              studied, as well as molecular templated silicate films.  Electrogenerated
              chemiluminescence will be optimized for analytical applications using ruthenium
              organometallics as a reagent.  

Deliberately engineered inorganic or hybrid
              films are key elements of nanotechnology research with possible industrial
              applications.
