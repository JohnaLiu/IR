Abstract    :
              This project concerns research in set theory and descriptive set
theory,
              particularly involving the influences of the axiom of
determinacy.  The axiom
              of determinacy is the statement that
every two-player integer game is
              determined, that is, one of the
players has a winning strategy.  Although this
              axiom contradicts
the axiom of choice, an accepted part of mathematics, it
              was
proposed in the 1960s to be a reasonable assumption for the
smallest
              inner model of set theory containing the real numbers.
This model contains the
              sets of reals occurring in ordinary
mathematical practice (e.g., the
              projective sets and beyond).
The study of this model, in turn, gives direct
              information about
the mathematical universe.  The notion of a scale is a
              central
structural concept in descriptive set theory, and the axiom
              of
determinacy was used to develop the scale theory of the
projective sets,
              which was later extended throughout the entire
model.  The scale theory by
              itself, however, is not sufficient to
answer many questions.  A more detailed
              inductive analysis was
begun in the mid 1980s which was successful at the
              lower levels
of the model, including the projective sets.  This theory
              does
not currently extend through the entire model, and finding such
an
              extension remains a central goal.  Recently, several new lines
of
              investigation have opened up, relating in some way to the
theory of this
              model.  One such direction concerns investigating
the connections between the
              existing theory of this model and the
theory of ultrafilters (Shelah's p.c.f.
              theory).  Preliminary
results, which use centrally Woodin's theory of the
              nonstationary
ideal, suggest strong collapsing principles apply as one
              moves
from the inner model to the real universe.  Exactly what is
forced to
              collapse, and what principles govern this phenomenon,
is a topic of
              investigation.  Finding and establishing principles
independent of the
              complete inductive analysis might also provide
a framework for propagating a
              basic "skeleton" of the analysis
through the entire model.

This project
              attempts to advance the understanding of the
mathematical universe of sets. 
              All of mathematics takes place
within this universe, and progress here is
              important not only
foundationally, but because of the direct influence on
              the
various branches of mathematics.  It has been known for some time
that
              strong assumptions are needed to answer many basic
mathematical questions. 
              Identifying these assumptions and
exploring their consequences is a major
              theme in set theory.  The
axiom of determinacy is an important example of such
              an axiom.
This was formulated in the 1960s but the full extent of
              its
consequences is not known.  Recent evidence suggests that it may
shed
              light on some basic mathematical questions, such as the
continuum hypothesis
              (the question of how many real numbers there
are).
