REU Sites:  Research
              Experience for Undergraduates in Computer Vision

    This project represents
              a continuation of a Research Experience for Undergraduates site
which has
              operated successfully for the past {\bf thirteen} years. Approximately {\bf one
              hundred thirty} undergraduate students from several  institutions in Florida
              and outside Florida have participated in this
program. The key distinctive
              elements of our approach are (1) to have a full calendar year experience
              planned for the participants, so that they have time to follow a substantial
              project through to completion, (2) to  present each participant with several
              possible project topics, so that they can feel they have chosen a project which
              is most interesting to them, (3) to immerse the participants in the general
              research environment
essentially as if they were graduate students, by having
              them meet with their faculty advisor once each week
to discuss their project,
              participate in the weekly research group meetings, attend research
              presentations and meet with visiting researchers, and (4) to follow through
              over the year by working with the students
to write a technical report on
              their project, to prepare for the GREs and to apply to graduate programs.
In
              past years, a large fraction of our REU participants have been able to prepare
              a paper for submission to a conference, have the paper accepted and then attend
              the conference to present the paper. Several past participants have even
              accomplished substantial enough research to also result in journal
              publications.
Many of our past participants are now pursuing graduate studies
              at various institutions, and some are now occupying faculty positions.
