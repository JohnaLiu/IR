Abstract    :
              To advance the state-of-the-art in conjugated polymeric transistors by examining
              ordered conjugated polymer systems and developing ways to engineer it for
              enhanced mobilities and improved current drive capability. This project will
              investigate polymeric thin film transistors (TFT) using oriented conjugated
              polymers to elevate mobility and polymers doped with low molecular weight
              compounds to enhance charge injection. Recipes and materials developed in
              Germany will be used to orient and dope the polyflourenes and apply them to
              polymeric field effect transistors (FET). Processing schemes will be developed
              to fabricate prototypes which reduce the source/drain resistance to the channel
              while maintaining compatibility with polymer processing.

This project team
              will design, fabricate and test polymeric field effect transistors to advance
              active matrix polymeric flat panel displays. Large area displays, which could
              be manufactured using cheap reel-to-reel batch technology, and which are
              ultra-thin and flexible could become a reality soon. Flexible displays and low
              production costs make light emitting polymers (LEP) a competitive option for
              the manufacture of flat panel display technology. Development of polymer
              electronics will fuel this revolution by their integration with LEPs into smart
              pixels for active matrix displays. This proposal addresses some of the key
              impediments to this realization.
