Abstract    :
              This grant will allow the PI's to build a seafloor swath bathymetery and
              sidescan mapping system with an intermediate frequency (30 kHz). This system
              will be based on the design used by the Hawaii Mapping Research Group (HMRG) to
              construct the new DSL-120 that will be operated by Woods Hole Oceanographic
              Institution. The common technical systems and software will allow scientists
              and technicians to work easily with both systems. The new instrument will allow
              scientists to explore the ocean floor with a resolution that was previously
              unavailable. In particular, the instrument could be used to advance our
              understanding of offshore fault systems. These fault systems affect a large
              percentage of the U.S. population when they shift. Further understanding of
              these systems could be important in future efforts to minimize impacts of
              earthquakes. Once the instrument is constructed and tested, it will be operated
              as part of the University of Hawaii shared-use equipment pool.
