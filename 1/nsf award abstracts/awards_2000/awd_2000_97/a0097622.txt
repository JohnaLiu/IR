Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to bring fifteen Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) students each year to the annual ASLO winter meeting and
              AGU Ocean Sciences meetings. The REU students must have completed a research
              project during the previous year and be ready to present the results of their
              work either as a poster or as a talk.  One student will be selected from each
              of the REU sites supported by OCE. Each student will receive air and shuttle
              bus fare, registration, room, per diem meal expenses, a ticket to the Award
              Luncheon or similar official event, and a one-year membership in both ASLO and
              AGU. Students will be prepared well for meeting navigation, paired with a
              mentor, and then left largely on their own during the day. Optional daily
              meetings at the end of the sessions will provide for feedback and interaction.
              A special poster session will be organized for the REU and other students.
              Mentors will be selected from senior scientists who work in the area of the
              student's interest. The majority of the presentations will be by current
              seniors who will be at a critical career juncture during the meeting.
