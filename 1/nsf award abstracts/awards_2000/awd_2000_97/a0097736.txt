Abstract    :
              This award will provide funding to Wayne State University (WSU)for an REU Site
              in various aspects of sensor and microsystem design, fabrication, and
              integration, under the direction of Dr. Gregory Auner.  The project will
              involve of minimum of 12 undergraduate students and 4 faculty annually in
              individual research projects covering topics which include electronic,
              magnetic, and photonic materials, devices, and associated interactive
              electronics.  Students will be exposed to a variety of experiments and
              measuring techniques, as part of the ongoing research programs in Smart Sensors
              and Integrated Microsystems (SSIM), which is a central facility in the College
              of Engineering with participating faculty from engineering, physics, chemistry,
              and medicine as well as researchers from other universities and the private
              sector.  The students will be provided with a comprehensive research and
              educational experience in smart sensors and integrated microsystems and an
              increased awareness of the post-baccalaureate opportunities in graduate
              programs in science and engineering, or in industrial research settings.
