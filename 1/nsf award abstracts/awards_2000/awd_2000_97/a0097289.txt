Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to the University of California-Berkeley for a 5
              year REU Site Program entitled, "Summer Undergraduate Program in Engineering
              Research at Berkely (SUPERB)-Network Technologies," under the direction of Dr.
              Jan Rabaey.  This 8-week summer program will provide 6 undergraduate students
              from diverse backgrounds a stimulating research experience with mentoring by
              faculty and senior graduate students.  Each student will be carefully matched
              with a faculty member, working in emerging Networking Technologies such as
              networking, wireless communications, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and
              integrated circuits.  The students will have access to state-of-the-art
              computing and networking equipment throughout the program. The students will
              attend weekly meetings where they will meet with faculty to learn more about
              the research focus of their projectsand to hear talks on how to improve
              communications skills and apply to graduate school. The evaluation plan for
              this project calls for systematic tracking of participants after they leave the
              program, and the assessment of both educational outcomes as well as the broader
              effect on the host institution.
