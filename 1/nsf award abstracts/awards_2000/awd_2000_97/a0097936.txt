This research aims at developing novel
              mathematical algorithms and associated software for systematic determination of
              optimal design margins for chemical processes (CP).  These design margins
              guarantee that flexibility of the CP at the operation stage.  A flexible CP is
              able to operate reliably in spite of the use of inaccurate mathematical process
              models during the design of the CP.  The flexibility of a CP is a very
              important concern in the design of chemical processes, from economic, safety
              and environmental points of view.  Model uncertainties that impact flexibility
              are primarily of three kinds: (a) model structure uncertainty, (b) parametric
              uncertainty (introduced as a result of determining model parameters in the
              presence of measurement uncertainty), and (c) operational uncertainty.  In this
              work, the PIs are concerned with (b) and (c).

Flexibility issues have
              traditionally been considered through the use of over-design factors, which are
              based on rules of thumb and experience.  Over-design factors are inherently
              empirical and often lead to costly and inefficient use of resources.  The
              broader impact of this project is to develop methodologies that will reduce the
              need to use empirical over-design factors in industrial design.  Specifically,
              the following problems will be addressed: (i) estimation of the flexibility of
              the CP (i.e. the CP's ability to sustain an acceptable level of performance
              even when external and internal factors change in an unpredictable fashion
              within certain known bounds), and (ii) CP optimization under uncertainty at the
              design stage.
