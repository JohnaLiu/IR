Abstract    :
              This award provides renewed funding to support the Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Center
              for Great Lakes Studies (CGLS). The program will host ten nationally recruited
              undergraduate students in a cohesive, multi-disciplinary science research
              training program. The program lasts for ten weeks in the summer, during which
              the students will conduct independent research under the guidance of a faculty
              mentor or as part of a research team. Workshops on instrumentation, graduate
              school, career opportunities, writing and public presentation of results will
              be offered. Students will also participate in a variety of fieldwork aboard the
              R/V LAURENTIAN. At the close of the program, students will present a poster and
              a 15- minute oral presentation of their research results. They also will write
              a short journal article that can be submitted for possible publication. The
              program is based on the theory that mentoring and networking are the most
              effective methods for recruiting students into a profession and for training
              young researchers. This program is well designed to encourage highly motivated
              students to continue the their pursuit of research careers in oceanography and
              limnology. It encourages interdisciplinary research and offers the students
              opportunities for field research experience. The program will encourage a
              diverse set of students to continue their education in the field of
              oceanography. In the past the program has had more than 50% female
              participants, has drawn students from across the nation, and has attracted an
              ethnically diverse group of students.
