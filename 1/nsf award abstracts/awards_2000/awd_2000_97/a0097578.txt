Abstract    :
              The Hope College REU program is intended to provide students with an opportunity
              to have a significant research experience which will enhance their desire to
              undertake a research career. The projects available to the students come from a
              wide variety of specialties; nuclear physics, both experimental and
              theoretical, technical education of the nonscientist, fracture mechanics,
              aircraft safety, biomechanics and relativistic astrophysics. The eight REU
              student researchers, and a similar number supported by other sources, will work
              side-by-side with the faculty in the lab with daily personal contact. Most of
              the students arrive with little or no experience in the special area of
              research. At the same time, we have only the undergraduates to help us do the
              research we undertake so that it is important that they learn quickly and start
              contributing early. Thus, they will be given responsibility and freedom to
              think for themselves while being supervised closely. The process has been
              successful in the past with many students being co-authors on refereed
              publications.  Students will present their results and prepare posters.  Funds
              are available to support travel to a meeting. Students will receive stipends,
              housing and travel allowance.
