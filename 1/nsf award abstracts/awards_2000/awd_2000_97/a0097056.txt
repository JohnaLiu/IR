Abstract    :
              This proposal studies the evolution and subsequent maintenance behavior of code
              in two very large open-source projects, Linux and GCC free software, to provide
              insight into the software engineering aspects of open-source software. 
              Focusing on the coupling between components and how this coupling changes over
              time, successive versions of Linux and GCC are examined, analyzing the change
              from version to version of each product.  The coupling between two units of a
              software product, a measure of the degree of interaction between those units,
              is used as a measure of maintainability.  Tools are built to compute these
              changes in coupling, and the output from these tools will be subjected to
              statistical analysis.  The research sheds light on the importance in software
              maintenance of the skill of the individual software engineer and ameliorates
              the lack of data as to the effectiveness of "open software" development as
              compared to commercial software development.
