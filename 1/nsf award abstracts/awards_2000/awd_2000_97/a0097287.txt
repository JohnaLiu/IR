Abstract    :
              Prior modeling efforts have demonstrated a dramatic shift in nutrient transport
              fluxes as resolution was increased from coarse scales (1.6') to the eddy
              resolving case (0.1').  Whereas coarse resolution models suggest the dominance
              of convective and diffusive nutrient supply, higher resolutions showed that
              eddy-induced upwelling was important.  For this reason, the principal
              investigator plans to run a five-component biogeochemical model at an
              eddy-resolving spatial resolution of 0.1' to test the following two hypotheses:
               (1) the primary impact of mesoscale eddies on upper ocean ecosystems is the
              supply of inorganic nutrients through vertical transport processes, and (2)
              below the euphotic zone, the primary influence of mesoscale eddies on
              biogeochemical cycling is horizontal transport of dissolved materials. 
              Understanding gained from these modeling studies will be used to guide the
              development of parameterizations for mesoscale biogeochemical processes to
              permit their inclusion in global ocean circulation models.
