Abstract    :
              A program of research in theoretical cosmology will include studies of
              the
formation and evolution of various topological defects --
              special
structures such as domain walls, strings and monopoles -- in the
              universe.  
These remnants of the big bang could still exist in the present
              universe
and could produce a variety of observational effects.  A discovery
              of
topological defects would provide important information both
              about
elementary particle physics and about the early universe.
