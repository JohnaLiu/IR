Abstract    :
              The Department of Physics at the University of California, San Diego proposes to
              offer summer research training to fifteen undergraduate students per year for
              the next 5 years.  Applications will be considered from students across the
              nation.  Students will participate in an individual research project supervised
              by a Physics Department faculty member.  Student projects will include
              experimental, theoretical, and computational research in high energy physics,
              condensed matter physics, biophysics, plasma physics, astrophysics and
              nonlinear physics. The research projects will be designed to guide students
              from a dependent research status to one that will allow each student to become
              as independent as their research skills and abilities permit.  On arriving,
              students will work with their faculty advisor to prepare and present a proposed
              project.  At the end of the summer, they will write a final research report and
              give a presentation at a campus wide Undergraduate Research Conference run by
              the UCSD Academic Enrichment Office.  The REU program includes physics seminars
              by faculty, regular meetings with one of the program directors,
              seminars/workshops on computer usage, laboratory safety and library research,
              and joint scientific seminars and meetings with groups from other departments. 
              Students will have the opportunity to attend workshops on graduate school
              admission and fellowship procedures, how to write a research paper, public
              speaking, instructional technology and GRE training.
