Abstract    :
              The Baylor REU program has been in place for the past six years at Baylor. 
              Selected Fellows reside on-site for approximately ten weeks with two-week
              extensions available for those requesting them.  Fellows are selected using a
              national application process with the program advertised at universities around
              the nation, smaller undergraduate and technical institutions with little or no
              research capability and historically minority institutions.  Complete
              application information, research information and the ability to apply to the
              program on-line is provided through a dedicated REU web page.  Selected NSF
              Fellows choose from theoretical or experimental research opportunities in
              astrophysics, dusty plasmas, elementary particle physics, nuclear physics,
              space physics or surface physics.  All REU Fellows are required to give an end
              of summer presentation.   Additionally, they are strongly encouraged to present
              their results at international conferences and invited to publish their results
              (when possible) in peer-reviewed journals.  The program provides funding both
              for student participation at such conferences and the associated publication
              costs.
