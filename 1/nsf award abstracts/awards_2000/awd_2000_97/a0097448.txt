Abstract    :
              This joint Chemistry Division and Division of Human Resources Development
              (Program for Persons with Disabilities) award supports the continuation of a
              Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at James Madison University
              (JMU).  Daniel Downey is the site's Program Director; Gina MacDonald is the
              Co-Program Director. Nine faculty will serve as REU student mentors.  During
              the award period (2001-2003), each summer eight undergraduate students (to
              include a minimum of one deaf student), one interpreter student, one high
              school teacher (who is either deaf or teaches the deaf), and two high school
              students (to include a minimum of one deaf student) will participate in a
              ten-week program.  Students will be recruited from regional colleges and
              universities as well as from JMU.  Recruitment efforts will target
              under-represented groups in science: namely, females, ethnic minorities and the
              deaf.  At least 75% of the student participants are expected to represent these
              underrepresented groups.  Research opportunities will be available in a variety
              of sub-disciplines including materials science, biochemistry, synthesis,
              environmental chemistry and spectroscopy.  In addition to the research
              objectives, there will be discussions on ethics in scientific research.  At the
              conclusion of the program, student participants will give oral presentations of
              their research and submit written reports summarizing their results and
              conclusions.  Project evaluation will include statistical studies of tracking
              the future of each participant.  A complex assessment process will begin with
              the entry of the participants into the program.  Career goals and professional
              direction will be monitored.
