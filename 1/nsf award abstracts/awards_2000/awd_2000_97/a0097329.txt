Abstract    :
              The goal of this research is to develop the necessary methodology for automated
              recognition of generic object and concept classes (such as buildings, cars,
              boats, and trees) in digital images in order to substantially improve the
              process of content-based image retrieval, which has relied mainly on low-level
              color and texture features for matching queries to database images. The
              approach has three major aspects: (1) to design new high-level image features
              including cluster features that group together lower-level features and
              relationship features that capture spatial relationships among them; (2) to
              develop a unified representation that can express a large variety of both low-
              and high-level features in a form that can be used by learning systems; and (3)
              to automate the development of recognizers for object and concept classes
              through the use of a hierarchical, multiple classifier methodology. The
              resulting techniques are being evaluated on several different large image
              databases, including commercial databases whose images are grouped into broad
              classes and a ground-truth database that provides a list of the objects in each
              image. The results of this work will be a new generic object and concept
              recognition paradigm that can immediately be applied to automated or
              semi-automated indexing of large image databases. The methodology will help to
              bridge the gap between the high-level needs of users of image retrieval systems
              and the low-level features typically extracted from an image. The generic
              object class recognition algorithms we develop will begin a new era of object
              recognition research, leaving the geometric domain and entering the conceptual
              domain.
