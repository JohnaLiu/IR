The objective of this project is to explore the use of  borehole
              ground penetrating radar (GPR) for the measurement of water content in
              landfills by studying the relationship of the electrical and dielectric
              properties of decomposing refuse with its water content.  Specifically, two key
              issues underlying the use of borehole GPR for water content measurement will be
              addressed:  (1) determination of the frequency-dependent electrical and
              dielectric properties of decomposing refuse and (2) definition of the spatial
              sensitivity of the borehole GPR method to spatially variable electrical and
              dielectric properties.  Laboratory column experiments will be conducted to
              fulfill the first goal.  To fulfill the second goal, analytical and numerical
              methods previously developed by the PI will be extended to fit the borehole GPR
              situation; these analytical descriptions will be field tested for one year in
              an operating landfill of the City of Tucson as a part of its reclamation of the
              historic Rio Nuevo district.  Better measurement and monitoring of water
              content in a bio-reactor landfill is important to its operation.  Too much
              water impedes the flow of air through the refuse slowing the rate of
              degradation; insufficient moisture can lead to increased subsurface
              temperatures, reduced reaction rates and the potential for subsurface
              combustion.  Other environmental applications dependent upon measurement of
              volumetric water content of the subsurface include estimation of natural
              recharge, optimization of artificial recharge and soil aquifer treatment
              operations, monitoring of slope stabilization and isolation of hazardous
              wastes. ***
