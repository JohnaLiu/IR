Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award is a continuation of a Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site at Wellesley College.  Chris Arumainayagam and David
              R. Haines share duties as the site's Program Director.  Over the award period
              (2001-2003) they will oversee a program of interdisciplinary research between
              chemistry and other departments, particularly biological sciences, physics,
              computer sciences, environmental science, and the social sciences.  A new
              aspect of the program is the inclusion of physics faculty and students in the
              research efforts.  Approximately 25 chemistry and physics students will
              participate in the ten-week summer research program each year, with ten of
              those students supported by this award and the remainder by the College and
              other funding sources.  Five of the ten participants will be selected primarily
              from institutions with limited research opportunities.  The site encourages the
              participation of women and students from other underrepresented groups.  The
              students will conclude their experience with a campus-wide poster session.
