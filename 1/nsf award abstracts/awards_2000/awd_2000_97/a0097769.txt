Abstract    :
              Penn State University operates a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)
              Site in its Physics Department. Undergraduate research projects span the areas
              of materials and condensed matter physics, with some projects in other areas of
              physics.  Twelve undergraduate students are recruited every year for a ten-week
              summer research experience, with a recruitment focus in the mid-Atlantic
              region.  In addition to the research activities, students attend weekly
              seminars and participate in extra-curricular activities and in a local research
              symposium at the end of the summer.
