"Pulsational Properties of Type II Cepheid Variable
              Stars"
AST-0097353

Unlike their Type I counterparts, Type II Cepheid
              variable stars, while also highly evolved, are low mass stars left over from
              the early stages of the formation of the Milky Way Galaxy. They are important
              for the study of the history of the Milky Way, for studies of pulsational
              instabilities in stars and for understanding the evolution of the older
              populations of stars in the Milky Way. But there are no clear criteria for
              assigning stars to this class and the main objective in this award is to  
              establish these by gathering together photometric and spectroscopic data for a
              sample of at least 50 likely Type II Cepheids. Following this initial work, a
              second stage of the project will enable the masses of the stars to be
              determined from theory. The masses are important for studying the general
              evolution of the old stellar populations.
