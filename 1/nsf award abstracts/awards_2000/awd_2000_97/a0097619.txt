Abstract    :
              This award provides funds for an REU Site in psychology at Kent State
              University.  Ten junior-level REU students, recruited from 17 regional colleges
              and two other institutions that offer more promise for recruiting students from
              underrepresented groups, will participate.  Faculty members participating have
              research interests in cognitive psychology, health psychology, psychobiology,
              or social psychology.  Student activities include a Spring interview day, a
              10-week summer research experience involving one-on-one faculty-student
              collaborations, and follow-through activities in the Fall after the summer
              research experience.  The goal of the program is to allow student participants
              who may have limited past research background to have a research experience
              that will more them from novice to relative independence in the laboratory. 
              The program will include student preparation prior to arrival at the Site,
              social gatherings, seminars on research methods and design,  weekly brown bag
              seminars, and presentations at regional or national meetings.  

This award
              contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students
              into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.
