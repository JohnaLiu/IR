Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports a new Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates (REU) site at Kent State University.  Robert Twieg is the site's
              Program Director; Arne Gericke is the Co-Program Director. Eleven faculty will
              serve as REU student mentors.  During the award period (2001-2003), each summer
              ten students will participate in a ten-week program. The focus of the program
              will be on liquid crystals - synthetic and natural systems. It will have a
              distinct interdisciplinary characteristic with strong connections to biology,
              biochemistry, materials science, and physics.  Recruitment efforts will target
              students from those smaller Ohio undergraduate institutions that lack research
              opportunities, and national institutions that represent minority students.  No
              students will be recruited from Kent State University.  All participants will
              present their research at the end of the summer via a poster presentation. 
              Several of the students will be selected to present their work at an ACS
              meeting.
