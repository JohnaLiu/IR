               ABSTRACT

OCE-0097291

In this project, researchers at the Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution will continue operations of the Planning and Data
              Management Office (PO/DMO) of the U.S. Joint Global Flux Study (U.S.JGOFS)
              U.S.JGOFS planning has been funded at some level  since the inception of the
              program in 1986, and a specific Data Management Office grant was added in 
              1994.  Overall, the goal of the PO/DMO is to support the completion of U.S.
              JGOFS activities and the  promotion of JGOFS accomplishments.  The Office will
              work especially toward securing the JGOFS legacy through support of synthesis
              efforts and outreach to fellow oceanographers, earth system scientists and  the
              public at large. Of key importance will be the production of a high-quality
              data archive that outlasts the  U.S. JGOFS Program and serves future
              generations of biogeochemists studying ocean processes, especially in the
              context of global change.  

A ramping down of research funding to U.S. JGOFS
              PIs has been underway for the past four years, but activities continue at the
              Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) and Hawaii Ocean Time Series (HOT) stations
              and in the Synthesis and Modeling Project (SMP) though 2003, with projects
              funded in  2001/2002 presumably ending in the  2004/2005 time frame.  The
              PO/DMO activities under this award will be directed toward providing logistical
              support for the final stages of these projects.  Activities described in this
              proposal would thus continue through 2003, when the U.S.JGOFS community  is
              expected to host the last major International  JGOFS Open Science Conference in
              Washington, DC.  Thereafter, the top priority of the PO/DMO will be  to produce
              and distribute the final U.S. JGOFS data products on CD/DVD or other more
              permanent  media.
