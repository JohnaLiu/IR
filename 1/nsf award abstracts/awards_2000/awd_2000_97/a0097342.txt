Abstract    :
              This award is for NSF co-sponsorship of a workshop to develop a multi-author,
              advanced-level textbook for human-computer interaction (HCI) in the area of
              theories, models, and frameworks. Human-computer interaction is a broad and
              interdisciplinary area concerned with interactions among computational,
              behavioral, cognitive, social and organizational factors in the design and use
              of information technology. This area has rich scientific foundations, but they
              are not addressed in graduate curricula and are under-utilized in research and
              development. The approach proposed is to form a committee of leading experts
              who can represent each of about a dozen important scientific areas and
              theoretical positions: human perception, motor behavior, information
              processing, notational systems, interaction languages, problem-solving and
              exploration, distributed cognition, common ground and grounding in dyadic
              interactions, small group analysis, ethnographic workplace studies,
              organizational science and design rationale. A face-to-face workshop will
              integrate and synthesize first-draft materials and develop a plan for revising
              chapters into a coherent book. The objective is to raise the quality and
              legitimacy of human-computer interaction research with respect to underlying
              theoretical issues.
