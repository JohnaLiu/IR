This award to Duke University on behalf of the Duke/UNC
              Oceanographic Consortium provides instrumentation to update and expand the
              oceanographic research capabilities of the research vessel Cape Hatteras, a
              ship operated by DUNCOC as part of the University-National Oceanographic
              Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.  The acoustic Doppler current
              profiler, salinometer, echosounder upgrades and water sampling bottles will all
              be available as shared-use tools for all scientific users of the research ship.
               These improvements will be of substantial advantage to marine scientists using
              the ship in their research during 2001 and future years.
