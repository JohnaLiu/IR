Abstract    :
              This goal of this project to more fully understand the capabilities and
              limitations of the cw Raman laser through detailed probes of the optical
              dynamics.  In particular, the research will i) expand the studies of the
              quantum statistics of the Stokes output, ii) measure the intensity correlations
              in the anti-Stokes four-wave mixing, and iii) build a cw Raman ring laser to
              study the competition and correlations in the forward and backward modal
              intensities.
