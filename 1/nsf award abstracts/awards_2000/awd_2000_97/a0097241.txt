This award to University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of
              Oceanography provides instrumentation to significantly improve the
              oceanographic research capabilities of the research vessel Endeavor, an
              NSF-owned ship operated by URI as part of the University-National Oceanographic
              Laboratory System research fleet.  The echosounder and acoustic Doppler current
              profiler supported here will replace aging systems with modern ones, providing
              state of the art capability to all ocean researchers using the ship.  These
              improvements will be of substantial advantage to marine scientists using the
              ship in their research during 2001 and future years.
