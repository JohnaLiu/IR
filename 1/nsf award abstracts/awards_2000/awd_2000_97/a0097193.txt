This award supports David Audretsch and students from the
              Indiana University-Bloomington in a collaboration with several universities in
              Germany, and with the Mannheim Center for European Economic Research.  The
              project will focus on discovering what factors are generating the new wave of
              high-tech startup firms in Germany, in particular through the mechanism of the
              Neuer Markt, an new, NASDAQ-like exchange.  Since little is known about
              entrepreneurial activity as an economic factor, the contribution of the
              proposed research will be great.  Even in the United States, where
              entrepreneurship is highly valued and encouraged, there is little hard
              empirical data about its role in economic development.  The current economic
              forces at work in Germany have made the creation of high-tech startup firms a
              focal point of public policy debate there, and has led to a broad range of
              reforms, privatization, and deregulation to generate entrepreneurship and a
              "new" economy.  The proposed work will take advantage of the "Neuer Markt,"
              which offers a new source of information on German high-tech firms.  The
              results of this study will enable policymakers to focus on which policies and
              factors really influence the creation and sustainability of high-tech
              firms.
