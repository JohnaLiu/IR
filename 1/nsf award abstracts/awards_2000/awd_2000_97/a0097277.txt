Abstract    :
              This project centers around the determination of masses of light ions to
              unprecedented precision using the mass spectrometer that has been developed
              over a number of years at the University of Washington.  Using only
              radio-frequency methods for observing the normal mode frequencies of a single
              isolated ion, bound to a Penning trap, it is possible to measure masses of low
              mass-to-charge-ratio ions relative to a multi-charged carbon ion with an
              overall accuracy that well exceeds one hundred parts per trillion with 24 hours
              of data and approaches ten parts per trillion in 8-10 days.   Projects for the
              award period include 1) development of a reliable apparatus that allows an ion
              of practically any element to be loaded from an external ion source into the
              spectrometer; 2) measurements of light-ion masses at the ultimate accuracy of
              the instrument; 3) improvements of the spectrometer to attempt to achieve an
              accuracy of ten parts per trillion in one day; and 4) refinement of the
              measurement of the tritium-helium-3 mass difference to an accuracy of 0.1 eV.
