Abstract    :
              0097409  Tepper  This research focuses on the development of a new miniature
              sensing technology based on chemically sensitive and highly selective polymer
              nanoparticles interfaced with a microfabricated transduction device. The
              particles are produced using a unique combination of supercritical fluid
              polymer processing, UV curing and molecular imprinting and consist of highly
              networked, monodisperse polymer nanoparticles imprinted for high selectivity to
              a specific molecular species.  The main objective of the proposed research
              project is to develop and demonstrate the performance parameters of the
              proposed sensor.  This will be accomplished by developing a prototype and
              experimentally verifying key performance criteria including chemical
              sensitivity, selectivity, response time and reversibility.  If successful, the
              proposed sensor would provide an unsurpassed level of performance in a field
              portable instrument.  Applications of the proposed sensor technology include
              environmental characterization, medical diagnostics, process control,
              intelligent appliances, and military surveillance.  Additional applications for
              the imprinted polymer nanoparticles include chromotography, specialty
              separations and filtering. ***
