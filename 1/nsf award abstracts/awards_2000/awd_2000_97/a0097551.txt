Abstract    :
              We propose to continue the University of Washington Physics Research Experiences
              for Undergraduates Program for an additional three years.  The program brings
              approximately 14 undergraduates to campus each summer to work with local
              faculty, postdocs, and students on forefront research projects.  The program is
              administered by a director and codirector who run two weekly meetings with the
              students, arrange and oversee the research assignments, and set up machine shop
              and other special instruction, as needed.  At the end of their 10 week visits,
              the students present seminars on their research activities and write papers
              summarizing their accomplishments.  The program is highly competitive, with
              about 20 applications per opening.  The program is administered jointly by the
              Institute for Nuclear Theory and the Department of Physics.  The students are
              housed together in a campus dorm.  Efforts are made to attract students from
              small colleges and women and minority students.
