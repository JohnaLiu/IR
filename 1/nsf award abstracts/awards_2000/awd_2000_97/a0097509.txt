Abstract    :
              The mechanical state of structures need to be monitored for a variety of
              reasons, including health diagnostics and health prognostics.  The task of
              identifying the location and nature of damage initiation and growth is made
              difficult by limitations of (i) sensor technologies and (ii) sensor densities;
              that can be achieved in realistic structures. Current technologies for
              mechanical sensors mostly focus on measuring deformations or stains, and are
              thus useful for deformation-based failure prediction models. In this study we
              propose to develop a novel class of MEMS-based, self-sufficient sensors that
              will make direct in-situ measurements of instantaneous local strain, stress,
              stiffness and energy density in the host structure. Specifically, we have
              proposed to: (a) provide proof-of-concept of the basic principles for a novel
              and completely new stiffness/energy sensor; (b) demonstrate a MEMS
              implementation of the underlying principles; and (c) demonstrate its
              application for damage/degradation modeling by mounting it externally to
              structural coupons. It is anticipated that this study will demonstrate and
              deliver the first working version of a fully autonomous sensor that will
              provide real-time, in-situ measurements of the changes in a structure's local
              stiffness and strain energy density.  In conjunction with the damage models to
              be developed during this study, this sensor will provide the first real
              opportunity to perform real-time health prognostics in complex structures,
              experiencing complex dynamic loading throughout their life-cycle.
