Abstract    :
              Molecular Physics Laboratory (MPL) of SRI International supports a site for the
              National Science Foundation's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
              Program.  The MPL has a worldwide reputation for its fundamental and applied
              research in atomic, molecular, and laser physics.  During the past eight years,
              81 undergraduate students have participated in MPL's REU program (74 with NSF
              support), collaborating with Ph.D. mentors on the MPL staff on a wide variety
              of experimental and theoretical research problems in these areas.  We propose
              to again recruit highly qualified undergraduate students; to work with them to
              identify the best match of student, mentor, and research project; and to
              provide a summer research program.  We will continue to provide each student
              with opportunities both formal and informal to perform exciting research,
              discuss their work, present project results, and explore science career
              possibilities with SRI staff mentors.  We expect this REU program to continue
              to produce student/mentor co-authored presentations and publications,
              undergraduates who have a better sense of the work of Ph.D. physicists at a
              research institute, and a research staff renewed by the energy and fresh
              perspective of young scientists.
