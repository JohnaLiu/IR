Abstract    :
              This project is an undergraduate research experience for eight students over
              seven weeks.  Students will work in a research group of four students with one
              faculty mentor. Mentors are selected on a rotating
basis from three research
              areas: hyperbolic geometry, number theory and inverse problems. 

Though the
              research areas are different the students will all collaborate in teams to
              conduct computer experiments, calculations, and simulations motivated by the
              problems. On the basis of the calculations
students to make discoveries and
              formulate conjectures, then moving on to proving theorems, establishing
              classifications, or developing algorithms. 

In addition to this technical
              program, students will be engaged in a companion program to develop their oral
              and written mathematical communication skills, collaborative, and other
              professional skills. This will be accomplished  through required oral
              presentations and technical reports on their work and a close, positive working
              environment among the students and the P.I. in the Theorodrome, the computer
              laboratory/workplace devoted to the REU.
