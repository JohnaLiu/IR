Abstract    :
              Minarik

During a ten-week summer program, thirteen undergraduate students
              will be given the opportunity to actively participate in the research program
              of a staff member at the Broad Branch Campus of the Carnegie Institution of
              Washington. The Broad Branch Campus includes both the Geophysical Laboratory
              and the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism. Recruitment efforts will
              especially target groups historically under-represented in science and students
              from institutions that are unable to offer a research experience. Scholarship,
              possible influence on career objectives, and the ability to match the student's
              scientific interests with available research projects will all be considered in
              the selection process.  While at the Geophysical Laboratory and the Department
              of Terrestrial Magnetism, each student will be assigned an advisor and a
              research project. Although varied, most of the student's projects will involve
              some aspect of earth or planetary geoscience research. The students will be
              instructed by their advisors in the use of the experimental, and/or analytical
              and computational apparatus that are utilized in the research programs. Each
              week the students will also meet in a group for a lunch seminar.  During this
              time Carnegie staff members will describe their own research interests and
              laboratory facilities.   Students will tour some of the government research
              laboratories in the area.  The students will be expected to prepare a paper
              describing their summer research results and to participate in a special
              student symposium where they will present their work to their peers and the
              scientific staff.
