Abstract    :
              This project addresses fundamental issues related to the electronic structure of
              organic films and interfaces. Materials to be investigated are pi-conjugated
              small molecules that are principal ingredients of vacuum-deposited organic thin
              film devices. The goal is improved understanding of the electronic structure of
              organic molecular interfaces and of the behavior of these interfaces in
              devices, leading to more predictive and accurate modeling. The studies involve
              a combination of surface and interface spectroscopy techniques: photoemission
              and inverse photoemission spectroscopy (PES, IPES), scanning tunneling
              spectroscopy (STS), internal photoemission, Kelvin probe-contact potential
              difference (KP-CPD) and interface transport measurements. Collaborations are
              established in the areas of organometallic chemistry and quantum chemical
              calculations on materials and interfaces.

These studies are expected to
              provide improved fundamental understanding of organic films and interfaces
              which are critical areas important to the development of organic materials
              based light emitting diodes and related devices with greater performance and
              efficiency for applications in electronics and photonics. An important feature
              of the program is the integration of research and education through the
              training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area.
