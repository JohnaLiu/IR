Abstract    :
              Los Alamos provides the Milagro site, the pond that houses the detector, and the
              buildings that house the electronics.  This proposal will provide certain
              infrastructure (such as telephone line cost, etc.) so that Milagro will be able
              to operate.  If this fund is forth coming, LANL will match it with people and
              other infrastructure.
