Abstract    :
              This award provides funding to Utah State University (USU), for a three-year REU
              Site Program in Space-Related Research, under the direction of Dr. Robert E.
              Spall.  During each summer, 8 undergraduate students will participate in an
              intensive 10-week research experience.  The primary compnent of the project
              requires students to complete a space-related research project (or component of
              a larger, ongoing project) primarily at the USU Space Dynamics Laboratory,
              under the direction of a faculty advisor and a graduate student mentor. 
              Students will also participate in weekly seminars with topics to include
              aerospace research, technical writing and oral presentations, and graduate
              school.  The program will culminate with attendance at the AIAA/USU Annual
              Small Satellite Conference at which the students will have an opportunity to
              present the results of their work.
