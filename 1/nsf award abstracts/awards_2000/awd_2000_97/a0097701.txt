Abstract    :
              The University of South Carolina operates a Research Experience for
              Undergraduates (REU) Site in its Chemical Engineering Department. The objective
              of the REU Site is to provide chemical engineering undergraduate students with
              experiences in areas related to materials research.  Undergraduates are offered
              research projects in three areas: inorganic materials as catalysts and
              adsorbents, materials for power sources, and polymers.  Ten students are
              recruited nationwide every year for a ten-week summer research experience. In
              addition to participating in individual research projects, students attend
              weekly technical seminars and career workshops, visit industrial sites and
              participate in group social activities.
