Abstract    :
              This is funding to subsidize expenses of student participants in the Student
              Research Workshop organized in conjunction with the Association for
              Computational Linguistics Conference (ACL'2000), which was held October 3-6,
              2000, in Hong Kong.  The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the
              primary international organization in the field of natural language processing
              and language engineering, with two regional chapters, Europe (EACL) and North
              America (NAACL), of approximately equal size.   The Association's annual
              conference, which rotates between North America and Europe, is the major
              international meeting in the field, and was held for the first time this year
              in a Pacific Rim country.   The workshop format allows students sufficient time
              to present their research (25 minutes) and receive feedback from a panel of
              established researchers in the field (15 minutes).   It will provide students
              with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives on their work at a critical
              time in their research, through feedback from the panel and other student
              participants.  The ACL Student Workshop is an inexpensive yet highly effective
              means of encouraging young and upcoming computational linguists.   The intimate
              format encourages the student participants to begin building a rapport with
              established researchers.  This nurturing effort should pay dividends by more
              effectively guiding students in this rapidly changing research field.   In
              addition, by building a supportive environment for these students, it is more
              likely that down the road they will in turn lend a supporting hand to other
              students who follow.
