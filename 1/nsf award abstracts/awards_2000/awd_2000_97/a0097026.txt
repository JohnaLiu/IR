Abstract    :
              With its move to larger quarters amongst the other Berkeley Natural History
              Museums, the University and Jepson Herbaria are entering a period of increased
              growth and use.  The bryophyte collection and associated programs of research
              and training have grown considerably in recent years.  The recent addition of
              the Norris collection has resulted in a 250% increase in size of the bryophyte
              collection.  The present project is to install a compactor system to house the
              new collections, which will increase access to these specimens by the
              scientific and other user communities.
