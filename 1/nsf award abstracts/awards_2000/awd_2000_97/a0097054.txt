Abstract    :
              The Second International Workshop on Oxide Surfaces (IWOX-2) is organized by
              Texas A&M University and will be held 15-19 January 2001.  The goal of the
              workshop is to facilitate multidisciplinary interactions and information
              exchange within a multidisciplinary group of researchers and top post doctoral
              scholars and graduate students studying, fuel cells, and electronic devices. 
              The NSF funds will be used to help invited speakers, graduate students, post
              doctoral scholars, and junior faculty participate in the
              symposium.
%%%
Important areas impacted by oxide surfaces include catalysis
              and electrocatalysis; photochemistry, photcatalysis and environmental
              remediation; biomaterials; ceramics; and sensors.  Students trained in these
              multidisciplinary areas compete very well in the job market in areas such as
              energy, transportation, chemicals, and electronics, and often go on to
              contribute in many significant ways to the global economy.
