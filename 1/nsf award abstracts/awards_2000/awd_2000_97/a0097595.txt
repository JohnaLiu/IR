Abstract    :
              The Cornell University Laboratory of Nuclear Studies offers a summer program for
              Undergraduate Research in Elementary Particle Physics, Accelerator Physics, and
              Synchrotron Radiation Science.  The Laboratory of Nuclear Studies at Cornell
              University will offer ten undergraduate students per year the excitement and
              challenge of frontier research in the area of elementary particle physics,
              accelerator physics and synchrotron radiation science.  These students,
              selected from colleges and universities throughout the United States, will
              spend ten weeks of the summer working at the world class facilities of the
              Cornell Electron-positron Storage Ring (CESR), the CLEOIII particle detector
              and the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS).  In addition to working
              closely with physicist mentors, they will participate in seminars, lectures,
              tours and activities designed to promote interactions among undergraduate
              researchers.  The participants will receive travel and lodging allowances as
              well as a summer stipend.
