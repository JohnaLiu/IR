              ABSTRACT

OCE-0097232


Using existing and related international data sets
              from the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study, researchers at the Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution will study the relationships  between export and
              production and the special role that food web processes may have in controlling
              upper ocean export. The results thus far indicate that the relative rates of
              carbon fixation and carbon removal via sinking  particles vary widely as a
              function of local food web dynamics. Given the large number  of studies that
              now use the uranium-238 series radioisotope 234Th as a proxy for POC export,
              these investigators intend to compile global maps of particulate organic carbon
              export from the upper ocean. They will look directly at the full range of 
              234Th export data to assess trends  between seasonal, episodic, or regional
              flux variability and a suite of physical and biological parameters.  Because a
              significant portion of export may occur during short pulses or events, the goal
              is to help  explain export variability in order to better model long-term mean
              export over larger time or space scales.

If common mechanisms can be found
              for the variations of production and export, these could then be  incorporated
              into more reliable models of the global carbon cycle. While much of the ocean
              is characterized by low relative POC export, sites of high export are most
              often characterized by food webs  dominated by large phytoplankton, in
              particular diatoms. If this result holds, models that attempt to  predict new
              and export production from surface chlorophyll or production alone will not
              resolve the local  carbon balance or allow one to model export controls. A
              mechanistic understanding of the underlying  export processes is crucial to
              being able to incorporate this understanding into models, particularly if we 
              desire to predict fluxes in future climate states.
