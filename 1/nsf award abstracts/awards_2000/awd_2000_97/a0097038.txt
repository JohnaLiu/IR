This award will supply shipboard scientific
              support equipment for the research vessel Gyre operated by the Texas A & M
              University and dedicated to use in support of marine research.  The Shipboard
              Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed
              essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. The Program
              provides support for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for
              the deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment
              such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the
              location of research sites, communication equipment including radio
              transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data
              communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting
              scientists to and from data retrieval sites.  The Project Director, Desmond
              Rolf is fully qualified to direct this project having had considerable
              experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard
              equipment.  This project will allow the institution to acquire an alarm system
              and a digital GPS.
