Abstract    :
              This research proposal will explore the patterns and trends of industry patent
              citations of academic science by technological field, geography, and firm
              characteristics.  The project will use a national sample of patents (as
              proposed in the modified proposal) and commercial data from the Compustat
              database.  The researcher will apply and construct sophisticated econometric
              modeling to gauge the impact of these factors on industry citations of academic
              science.
