One of the oldest and most enduring dreams of the scientific
              community
is to directly observe molecular structure nondestructively, in
              situ, in
three dimensions, with Angstrom-scale resolution.  Such an
              imaging
technology would immediately address urgent needs in
              nanoscale
engineering, materials science, molecular biology, and medicine. 
              The
objective of the proposed research is to create such a technology.

The
              proposed method is magnetic resonance force microscopy MRFM, which
was
              conceived in 1991, by the proposers specifically as a means for 3D
molecular
              imaging.  The central concept of MRFM is to combine
three-dimensional magnetic
              resonance imaging with angstrom-scale probe
microscopy.  MRFM was first
              experimentally demonstrated in 1992 in
collaboration with Dan Rugar's IBM
              group.  Subsequently, MRFM has
developed into a worldwide sensing and imaging
              research effort.

The specific aims of this NSF proposal are to:  (1)
              demonstrate
nanoscale resolution in 3D MRFM imaging; (2) achieve a
              reliable,
experimentally validated understanding of electron and proton
              spin
relaxation in the MRFM environment; and (3) extend present
              design
principles for optimal control and estimation to the quantum
              environment
appropriate to single spin imaging.

The proposed means are to: 
              (1) validate and calibrate the proposers'
newly completed 3D MRFM scanner, via
              force, parametric, and multiplex
imaging experiments; (2) design and operate a
              next-generation adaptive
digital controller, incorporating optimal control,
              estimation, and
diagnostic algorithms; and (3) survey electron and proton
              spin
relaxation in a variety of target samples.

The proposed opening of a
              new imaging window onto the largely unobserved
world of 3D molecular structure
              will revolutionize the fields of
nanoscale engineering, materials science,
              biology, medicine, and
engineering education.
