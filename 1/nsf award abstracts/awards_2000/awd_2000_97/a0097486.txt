Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates
              (REU) site at the University of Pittsburgh (UP), where a previous REU site was
              funded for 1997-1999.  Joseph Grabowski is the site's Program Director. At
              least sixteen faculty will be available to serve as REU student mentors. 
              During the award period (2001-2003), ten students will participate in a
              ten-week program each summer.  UP has chosen to replace the more traditional
              divisions of Chemistry (organic, physical, analytical, inorganic, biochemical)
              with a more integrated Chemistry world in which active researchers Make, Model,
              or Measure chemical properties or processes.  Therefore the focus of their REU
              site will be on the area of  "Measuring." Students will be recruited nationally
              and special linkages are being developed with several HBCUs.  Each student
              participant will be paired with a graduate student or postdoctoral mentor
              within the chosen research group to ensure timely answers to questions and to
              benefit from their advice when necessary.  This is in addition to a close
              interaction each student will have with his/her faculty mentor. Tutorials
              designed to demonstrate the range of measurements necessary for a
              technologically advancing society will be held throughout the summer program. 
              Near the end of the program, students will participate in a regional poster
              presentation.  The program will culminate in a public Chemistry Symposium in
              which each participant will give a 15-minute talk. Project evaluation will
              include an exit interview and a detailed end-of-the-program participant survey.
               Students will be tracked and surveyed for several years following the
              program.
