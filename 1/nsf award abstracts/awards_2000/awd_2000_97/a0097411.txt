Abstract    :
              This Chemistry Division award supports the renewal of Research Experiences for
              Undergraduates site at Kansas State University.  Anne Kelley is the site's
              Program Director.  Over the award period (2001-2003), eight students will be
              supported each summer in a ten-week program.  Recruitment will be from
              institutions nationwide that do not have Ph.D. programs in chemistry, with
              emphasis on smaller institutions, those offering little chemistry research and
              those institutions with substantial minority (particularly Hispanic)
              enrollments.  Fourteen different research projects are available for selection
              by the student participants.  Students will present their research by oral
              presentation the last week of the program.  Each student will be contacted on
              an annual basis to track his or her career progress.
