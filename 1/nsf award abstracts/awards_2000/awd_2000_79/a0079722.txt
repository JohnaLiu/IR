This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of
              Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences provides funds for
              acquisition of oceanographic, meteorological and atmospheric chemistry
              instrumentation for installation on a commercial cruise ship operating in the
              eastern Caribbean Sea and adjacent Atlantic Ocean.  Instrumentation will be
              operated by technicians provided by University of Miami, and will record data
              from weekly repeat tracks that cross major oceanographic boundaries and
              traverse through an important zone of atmospheric variability.  Instrumentation
              to be acquired with NSF support includes a wind profiler, pyranometer,
              photometers, nephelometer, condensation particle counters, CO and ozone
              analyzers, sea water fluorometer and other items; additional oceanographic and
              atmospheric sensors are being provided with separate support by NOAA and Royal
              Caribbean Cruise Lines, the vessel operator. In addition to recording data with
              the sensors supported here, the University of Miami personnel will include
              public outreach programs on the vessel, as well as research training courses,
              high school teacher training courses, on-board lectures, and distance learning
              programs.  The project is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF.
              University of Miami and their non-federal partners will provide cost-share
              support for more than 30% of total project costs.
