Abstract    :
              With this new award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
              the work of Dr. Brent L. Iverson in the Department of Chemistry at the
              University of Texas at Austin.   The goal of the work is to develop a
              "molecular Velcro," consisting of negatively charged polydonor strands that
              link selectively 1:1 to positively charged polyacceptor strands to provide high
              affinity (low dissociation constant) dimeric links.   Various combinations of
              polydonor and polyacceptor strand molecules will be investigated using HPLC,
              NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry, Biacore kinetic analysis, and molecular
              modeling.

The basic idea of the work is to develop complementary molecules
              analogous to the fiber and hook combination of real Velcro.  These tightly
              binding pairs of molecules can then be used to bind two large molecules
              together in close proximity, or to bind a large molecule to a surface.   There
              are potential applications in immunoassays and biosensors, for example in a
              sensor used to detect the presence of specific pathogenic bacteria.   In
              addition to possible practical applications, the work is expected to contribute
              to fundamental knowledge in the area of noncovalent binding, and to provide
              excellent training for the students involved.
