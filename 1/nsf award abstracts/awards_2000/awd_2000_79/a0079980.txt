The investigators propose to develop joint,
              self-consistent dynamical-thermodynamical models of the mantle that incorporate
              the complex thermodynamic description of multi-component mantle assemblages.
              Their approach will allow them to assess on an equal footing the three distinct
              causes of lateral heterogeneity in the earth's mantle: lateral variations in 1)
              temperature, 2) bulk composition, and 3) phase assemblage. Specifically, they
              plan to build on a previously developed formulation that includes complete
              thermodynamic information regarding the dependence of material properties on
              pressure and temperature in realistic multi-component systems. They can then
              incorporate the thermodynamic description into instantaneous flow calculations
              to examine the effects of phase transformations and bulk composition on geoid
              anomalies, dynamic topography, plate motions and mantle flow.
