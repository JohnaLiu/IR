Low-Energy Electron Microscopy (LEEM) is used to generate
              real-time images of surfaces with a lateral resolution of better than 10
              nanometer.  Surfaces can be imaged at arbitrarily high temperatures, and during
              growth.  Contrast in LEEM arises because of differences in electron
              reflectivity at the surface, which reflect variations in the structural,
              chemical and magnetic properties of the surface. This award will help establish
              a LEEM facility at Carnegie Mellon University for use by an interdisciplinary
              group of researchers spanning four University departments. Proposed research
              projects include investigations of phase transitions at surfaces,
              two-dimensional coarsening and growth, step and phase boundary fluctuations,
              GaN growth, wetting of organic films, surface magnetism, growth at chiral
              surfaces, and texture development in thin film growth.

Low-Energy Electron
              Microscopy (LEEM) is used to generate real-time images of surfaces with a
              lateral resolution of better than ten nanomters, during growth, and at
              arbitrarily high temperatures.  These unique features allow growth at surfaces
              to be studied in unprecedented detail.  A LEEM facility will be established at
              Carnegie Mellon University for use by an interdisciplinary group of
              researchers.  LEEM will be applied to a wide range of growth problems, from
              fundamental investigations of the chemistry and physics of surfaces, to process
              optimization in the development of new magnetic media.
