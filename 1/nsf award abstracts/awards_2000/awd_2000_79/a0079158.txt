Abstract    :
              This award by the Chemistry Division supports three studies involving the
              preparation and characterization of some organometallic systems with unusual
              bonding. The projects are: characterization of the nonclassical dihydrogen
              ligand in Rhenium coordination compounds, synthesis and characterization of
              compounds of quadruply bonded dimolybdenum containing phthalocyanine or
              dendrimer ligands and a new higher yielding synthesis for MoW(NMe2)6.

This
              project will contribute to knowledge of the coordination chemistry of the
              subject ligands.
