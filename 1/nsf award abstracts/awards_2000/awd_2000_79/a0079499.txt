This project will investigate how Tzeltal Maya reconcile
              their understanding of illness with the biologically-based characteristics of
              plants in order to select and maintain consensus about medicinal plant cures.
              Using an approach centered around "cognitive prototypes" (prototypes from the
              domains of plants and illness), the researcher will identify variables (taste,
              plant distribution, cultural interpretation of plant characteristics, etc.)
              employed by the Maya in selecting plants for medicinal use.  A number of
              hypotheses concerning the relationship between these variables and selection
              will be tested, as well as hypotheses about the relationship between specific
              illnesses and plant types.  Methods include structured interviews with samples
              from the population, a plant survey, and elicitation techniques regarding
              plant/illness qualities. Comparative data from Maya migrants will also be
              gathered to assess the degree to which these same cognitive prototypes guide
              plant selection in environments with different flora. This project will
              contribute to the field of cognitive science and to our understanding of how
              indigenous populations conceptualize and use medicinal plants to cure
              illness.
