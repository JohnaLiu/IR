Abstract    :
              With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor
              Majda and his coworkers at the University of California-Berkeley are carrying
              out studies of lateral mass and proton transport at the air/water interface. 
              These studies use electrochemical time-of-flight methods developed by Professor
              Majda, which are applied to model amphiphilic membranes.  Information about the
              lateral diffusion of molecules at the air/water interface, the dynamic
              structure of water at the interface, and proton diffusion at the
              air/lipid/water interface is obtained in these studies.  These interfacial
              transport processes are fundamental biological processes involved in membrane
              energy transduction and storage, and this research project provides important
              fundamental information about these processes. 

Using electrochemical
              transient methods, information about the lateral diffusion of molecules and
              protons at the air/water interface is obtained in this research project.  Using
              Langmuir monolayers as models of biomembranes, detailed two-dimensional
              diffusion information is obtained in these studies.  Proton transport
              information and diffusion constants are also of interest in many materials
              science applications such as battery and fuel cell technology.
