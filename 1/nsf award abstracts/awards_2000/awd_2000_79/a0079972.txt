Abstract    :
              This SGER is a preliminary grant to begin testing a hypothesis concerning using
              the web for learning guided by the use of Multi-User Virtual Environments as a
              place for competitive and collaborative learning games.  The hypothesis that
              this award is testing is that by tracking user performance, managing the set of
              available playmates for every student, and introducing virtual agent players at
              a variety of school levels, such a community of evolving learners can keep all
              participants appropriately challenged and motivated to learn.  To test this
              hypothesis, appropriate games and learning outcomes will be defined and the
              software protocols written to do playmate matching agent choice, and collection
              of data or student learning.  The students tested will be in fourth and fifth
              grade classrooms and work with games to improve learning of mathematics and
              elementary physics.
