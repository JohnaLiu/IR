Abstract    :
              The Division of Statistics at the University of California at Davis  will
              purchase a 32 node Beowulf supercomputing cluster which will be  dedicated to
              the support of   research in the mathematical and statistical sciences.  The
              equipment  will be used for several research projects, including in particular:
               studying regression trees for correlated survival data, specifically 
              prognostic classification of cancer and dental patients; Bayesian  analyses for
              detection of climate change and attribution to specific  anthropogenic causes
              such as increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and  sulfate aerosols; linkage
              analysis incorporating age of onset and  clustering methods to study gene
              expressions; nonparametric prediction  regions for multivariate, nonlinear
              stochastic processes; and  analysis of functional or curve data in experimental
              aging research.
