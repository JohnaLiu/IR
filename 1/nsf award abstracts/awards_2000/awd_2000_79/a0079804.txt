Abstract    :
              Instrumentation  will be aquired that will enable the measurment of low level
              sound and vibration in response to micro force. The instrumentation consists of
              4 main components: (1) an anechoic chamber, (2) a scanning laser vibrometer,
              (3) a dual channel compact fiber vibrometer, and (4) a de-aeration system. The
              anechoic chamber reduces the background noise and vibration. Presently,
              background noise is the main limiting factor in the newly developed imaging
              method called vibro-acoustography. The scanning laser vibrometer allows
              measurment of vibrations in angstrom range and determination of the spatial
              distribution of motion in response to a small point force. The dual-channel
              fiber vibrometer will be used to simultaneously measure vibration at two points
              of the object.  Finally, the de-aeration system is necessary to provide clean
              and completely degassed water for water tank experiments. 

Graduate
              students, research trainees and fellows, and senior investigators will use the
              above instrumentation. Addition of these equipment to  will help to attract
              more qualified students in the Biomedical Imaging track.
