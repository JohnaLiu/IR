MRI:  Development
              of a Comprehensive Real-Time Instrument for MIMO Wireless Channel Measurement
              and Space-Time Coding Implementation

The primary goal of this proposal is
              the design, construction, and testing of a general purpose wireless
              communications platform that can be used for multiple transmit and receive
              antennas channel measurement and space-time coding algorithm assessment. The
              proposed instrumentation will be extremely flexible, allowing for variable
              array geometry, antenna spacing, bandwidth (up to 20MHz), carrier frequency
              (500MHz-20GHz), modulation format, polarization, and path distance.  Two system
              configurations will be constructed, a tethered system for short range (<300m)
              indoor experiments, and another that permits longer range (300-5000m) outdoor
              experiments using GPS receivers for carrier phase lock.
