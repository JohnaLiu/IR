Abstract    :
              This project examines the educational impact of computing and information
              technologies, both at school and in the home, for middle and high-school
              students.  It investigates a second stage of the Digital Divide, one that goes
              beyond lack of access to information technology (IT). It examines whether there
              are different educational benefits to computing when comparing whites to
              minorities, boys to girls, and more affluent to poorer children. The research
              combines statistical analyses of survey data with fieldwork observations of
              children using computers at school, after-school programs, and at home. The
              goal of the research is to gain insight into the processes by which some
              children gain more than others in terms of educational benefits from computing.
              It seeks to document the educational benefits that are occurring, to identify
              what kinds of students are missing out on these benefits and why, and to
              identify what kinds of educational applications yield greatest benefits. This
              research is intended to aid policymakers who are concerned with equity issues
              in education, educators involved in providing effective information technology
              in schools, and to inform citizens about the educational consequences of the
              Digital Divide.
