MRI: 
              LIVE: Laboratory for Immersive Virtual Experiments

This proposal establishes
              the Laboratory for Immersive Virtual Environments (LIVE) which will provide a
              testbed for engineering and computer science research on distributed graphics,
              sensor integration, audio display, and human face, speech, and gesture
              recognition.  Psychologists will use LIVE to determine how visual perception
              drives information extraction, navigation, and human movement.  Scientists will
              use LIVE to explore and analyze their three dimensional datasets.  Twenty-five
              faculty members from nine departments will use LIVE to build and understand
              virtual worlds and human interfaces. The heart of LIVE will be a fully
              enclosed, 6-sided, 10'x10'x10', backprojected virtual reality environment to be
              housed at the Beckman Institute and the University of Illinois.
