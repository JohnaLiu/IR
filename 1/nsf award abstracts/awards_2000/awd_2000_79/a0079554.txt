Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT :

The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the
              University of Missouri-St. Louis will purchase computer equipment and software
              as follows:

(a) one SUN Enterprise 420R Server with 4 SPARC II processors
              
at 450 MHz (or later model), 4 GB of memory, and 36.4 GB harddisk

(b) one
              Hewlett Packard Visualize Workstation X-Class with 
two Pentium III processors
              at 866 MHz (or later model) 
with 1GB memory, 36.4 GB harddisk and graphics
              subsystem fx10+,

(c) High Performance Computing (HPC) tools  and C++ Visual
              Program Development for Solaris 8.0; Matlab for Solaris  and Windows NT;
              Unigraphics CAD and 3D-modeling software  for Solaris and Windows NT; AMBER
              software for Solaris;  PC Netlink for Solaris,

(d) peripheral devices: one
              printer for Workgroups HP 8000 DN,
one Digital Still Camera, one Color
              Scanner.

This equipment will be dedicated to the support of research  in the
              mathematical sciences. The equipment will be used for  several research
              projects, including in particular: 

(1) Face recognition using spline-based
              wavelet-frame analysis

(2) Mathematical modeling of cellular dynamic
              structure

(3) Tight frames of rational splines and applications
to CAD/CAM
              and computer graphics

(4) Wavelet X-ray computed tomography
