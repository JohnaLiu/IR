Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics at Wayne State University will purchase one UNIX
              server and four UNIX workstations, which will be dedicated to the support of
              research in the mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for several
              research projects, including in particular:  Cohomology of Modules over the
              Steenrod Algebra;  Estimation, Control, and Optimization of Large-scale and
              Hybrid Systems;  Computation of Differential Equations with Strongly
              Discontinuous Coefficients;  and Numerical Approximation of Singularly
              Perturbed Problems.

Seven faculty members in the department will participant
              in the proposed research projects.  Many graduate students will be involved in
              these research projects.
