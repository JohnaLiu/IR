Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project  addresses the
              need for customized learning tools in mathematics education for primary
              students with physical disabilities, in particular, those with significant
              hearing loss.  The Phase II study focuses on modifying and testing sections of
              existing multimedia so that they will be appropriate as instructional tools for
              PreK-K children with significant hearing loss.  The need is critical: 2 out of
              every 1,000 young children in the U.S. have hearing loss severe enough to
              adversely affect learning.  In addition, resources for these individuals are
              normally allocated to the development of language acquisition; thus, the
              development of mathematical computation and reasoning often is not addressed
              until a significant learning window has lapsed.  The National Action Plan for
              Mathematics Education Reform for the Deaf recommends that more resources
              address mathematics instruction for children with significant hearing loss. 
              Learning in Motion intends to modify a research-based, field-tested multimedia
              program for early learners of mathematics.  This program was the direct result
              of Phases I and II of a NSF SBIR project.  The multimedia program includes
              three-dimensional graphics and characters, completed game logic, and four
              interactive game areas that are suitable for modification.  The study's main
              objectives:  1) design, program, and test modifications to existing software
              games (4) with students with hearing loss, 2) conduct and use subjective
              observations from teachers and researchers to further refine the modifications,
              and 3) initiate a testing plan for the complete modified program.  Ultimate
              results include: salable multimedia for the under-represented group of students
              with significant hearing loss and publishable design guidelines for others
              electing to produce specialized software.

Learning in Motion seeks to
              provide in a completely modified mathematics multimedia program for
              hearing-loss children.  Design guidelines informed by the WGBH guidelines will
              also be produced, encouraging commercial collaboration with other publishers
              looking to produce similar programs.
