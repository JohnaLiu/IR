Abstract    :
              
The long-finned squid Loligo pealei is used at the Marine Biological
              Laboratory (MBL) for detailed neurobiological study at the molecular, cellular,
              tissue and whole animal levels.  For more than 28 years, this MBL/NSF squid
              program has enabled neurobiologists, physiologists, anatomists, biochemists and
              biophysicists to study fundamental properties of the nervous system.  The giant
              axon, the giant synapse and the eyes are outstanding and unique features of
              squids that render them as premiere marine models, and they continue to provide
              vital breakthroughs into mechanisms of synaptic transmission, nerve impulse
              propagation, axonal transport and organelle motility, membrane structure, cell
              repair, cell death, and ion channel distribution and function. 
Squids migrate
              inshore by early May and are available near Woods Hole, MA  through September
              each year.  About 40-60 investigators come to the MBL specifically during this
              period to carry out basic research using the squid as a model system.  To
              collect these delicate creatures,  the MBL has chartered a suitable trawling
              vessel - the Loligo- with a knowledgeable captain and mates to find and deliver
              squids throughout each summer.  NSF support has helped defray the cost of the
              summer charter vessel and developed methods for better maintenance and health
              of squids.  Scientists to the MBL come from diverse national and international
              geographical regions, and continued funding of this proposal extends beyond the
              actual science by providing an intellectually stimulating environment for the
              training of young scientists.
