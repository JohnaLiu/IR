Abstract    :
              We propose the development of a high-speed imaging system capable of
measuring
              the motion of both solid surfaces and fluid elements inside a
micromachined
              system.  The system is unique in that it will be capable of
operating both in
              the near infrared - a capability that allows it to see
through silicon
              substrates and into the inner chambers of complex
micromachined devices.  This
              will enable, for the first time, high-speed
measurements of the kinematics and
              dynamics of micromachined devices and the
motion of fluids inside complex
              micromachined systems.  Applications of this
instrument will include
              measurement of micro device operation (valves,
pumps, accelerometers,
              gyroscopes, etc), direct measurement of fluid
behavior inside micro-geometries
              where visible imaging is not possible due
to intervening silicon
              surfaces.

The instrument development includes the assembly of custom
              hardware for
infrared microscopy and illumination with lasers operating in
              conjunction
with nonlinear Opto-Parametric Oscillators (OPOs).  These create
              two very
short laser pulses (4 ns each).  The resultant image is captured by a
              pair
of near-IR focal plane arrays and downloaded to a Digital Signal
              Processing
Board (DSP) for real-time processing and display on a host PC. 
              Custom
signal processing software will enable three modes of operation:
              solid
motion measurement, solid deformation measurement and fluid
              motion
measurement.
