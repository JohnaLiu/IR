Abstract

The proposed
              Instrument Development is to produce a unique laser doppler differential
              velocimeter system for fine- spatial-resolution instantaneous measurements of
              the complete rate-of-strain and vorticity tensors in complex turbulent flows.
              This rate-of-strain and vorticity measuring LDV (ROSVOR LDV) will be a unique
              system providing measurements of the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate
              and the enstrophy without simplifying assumptions. Such measurements are needed
              for the further development of turbulence models.

The innovations in LDV
              technologies to be used here are: (1) the direct measurement of low uncertainty
              velocity differences from four closely spaced (100microns x 20microns) volumes,
              (2) the use of polarization-preserving fiber optics and beam combiners in a
              compact design, and (3) signal processing and data handling techniques for 9
              velocity-component differences simultaneously.

The goals of the Virginia
              Tech graduate program are to provide strong M.S. and Ph.D. education and to
              conduct research in state-of-the-art-facilities. Research opportunities are
              available for all qualified persons. In the past, there have been 3 women
              graduate students involved in this turbulence research program. Currently there
              is one woman graduate student. 

It is expected that, the proposed ROSVOR LDV
              will provide a new international standard for experimentally measuring the
              instantaneous rate-of-strain and vorticity tensors and determining the
              anisotropic contributions to the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate.
              These data are expected to guide the development of refined turbulence models
              that will be used throughout the modern CFD community.
