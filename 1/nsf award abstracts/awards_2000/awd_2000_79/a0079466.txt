MRI:  Acquisition of an
              Eight-Processor Sun 3500 Parallel Computer

This proposal is to improve the
              scientific and pedagogical computational capabilities at Vassar College.  Also,
              it is proposed to purchase an eight-processor Sun Enterprise 3500 shared-memory
              parallel computer with 4 gigabytes of RAM and 72 gigabytes of disk space.  This
              machine will assist research groups focusing on the following problems: (i)
              parallel computing with the goal of improving the performance of parallel Java
              programs, (ii) hydrodynamics simulations of stellar interactions, and (iii)
              simulations to investigate reactions between BaCeO3 and water vapor.  In
              addition to supporting faculty research, the new machine will also be
              invaluable for fostering and expanding student research and training.
