Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Kansas will acquire a X-ray
              diffractometer with CCD detector for small molecule diffractometry. This
              equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following:
              a) structural elucidation of anion coordination chemistry; b) elucidation of
              the effects of non-covalent interactions on metal ion reactivity; c) probing
              structure-function ramifications of tetrazamacrocyclic metal complexes in
              catalytic oxidation reduction reactions; d) examination of the influence of
              peptide porphyrin interactions on helix stability and on electron transfer; ;e)
              elucidation of structural influences on asymmetric metathesis catalysts; and f)
              studies of the growth mechanism for mercury-based high temperature
              superconductors.

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise
              measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including
              bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about the
              spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules. 
              These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, including the
              preparation of more efficient catalysts, chemical sensors, high temperature
              superconductors; and biochemistry.
