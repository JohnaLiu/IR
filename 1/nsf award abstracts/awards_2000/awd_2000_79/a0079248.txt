Abstract    :
              This project investigates appellate recruitment, elite representation, and
              judicial decision making in the higher British judiciary for a 155-year period
              of British history, 1845-1999. It significantly expands an existing database
              that encapsulates more than 150 measures of personal
              characteristics--especially family status and education legal backgrounds and
              experience, and career paths--on the judges of the High Court of Justice, the
              Court of Appeal, and the Lords of Appeals, and the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary.
               The project has three research objective: (1) To describe and analyze who has
              served in the higher British judiciary in the last century and a hal.  This
              aspect of the research will show how this judicial elite has changed over time,
              and how change in the composition of the judiciary has reflected (or failed to
              reflect) changes in British society and politics; (2) To develop a causal model
              of judicial recruitment to the appellate bench; and (3) To explore the
              relationship between background characteristics and judicial decision-making in
              a British context.
