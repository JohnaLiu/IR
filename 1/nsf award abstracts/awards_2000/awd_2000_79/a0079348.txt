Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at the Holy Cross College will acquire a 300 MHz NMR
              Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a)
              conformational studies of cyclohexane derivatives, tertiary amides and
              Gramacidin S; b) application of isotopic perturbation to halonium ions; c)
              measurement of carbon-13 - carbon-13 coupling constants in delocalized
              carbocations; d) incorporation of amino acids into organometallic compounds; e)
              synthesis of new therapeutic agents; f) use of covalently constrained
              dipeptides to affect protein folding; g) development of beta- and gamma-turn
              mimetics; h) natural product synthesis; i) synthetic organic methods
              development; and j) hydrogen/deuterium exchange kinetics.   

Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to
              chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to
              identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms
              within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules
              in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to
              chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR
              studies will have an impact in a number of areas including drug development and
              biochemistry.
