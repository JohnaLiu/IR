Abstract    :
              The Department of Mathematics and the Institute of Theoretical Dynamics at the
              University of California will purchase a Servernet-II based Beowulf cluster
              consisting of 32 Digital 21264 CPUs which will be dedicated to the support of
              research in the mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for several
              research projects, including in particular the following five
              projects.

Computational Studies of Flow in the Thoracic Aorta - Angela
              Cheer

Large Scale Numerical Linear Algebra Problems -  Zhaojun
              Bai

Computational Modeling of Micro-scale Jetting Processes with Industrial
              Applications - Elbridge Gerry Puckett

Object Characterization using
              Vector-Valued Sensor Data - N. Saito

Constructing conservative and
              dissipative differential equations - S. Shkoller
