Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project focuses on mass
              production of
triploid marine shrimp. Marine shrimp culture experienced
              exponential growth between 1980
and 1990, increasing from 5% to 28% of total
              world production. Since then, farmed shrimp
production has stagnated due to
              disease and water quality problems. Disease problems are
largely due to
              dependence on wild caught shrimp broodstock and post larvae, which carry
many
              untreatable viral diseases. A solution to this problem is closed-cycle culture,
              which
also permits genetic selection for improved production performance. To
              protect a breeder's
investment in specific pathogen free (SPF)stock, specific
              pathogen resistant (SPR) stock,
and genetic selection, it is highly desirable
              to sell only sterile post larvae. Triploidy is a
possible solution since
              triploids of other species are typically sterile and may exhibit
superior
              culture performance. In addition triploidy may allow for the culture of
              exotic
species in environmentally sensitive areas where exclusion of exotics
              is desirable. 
Phase II will focus on development of tetraploid breeding
              stocks that will be crossed with
normal diploid stocks to produce triploid
              progeny.

The successful outcome of our R&D effort will result in significant
              changes in marine
shrimp culture. It will prevent competitors from propagation
              of shrimp stocks that have
been genetically selected for aquaculture
              performance. It will help stimulate large-scale
investment in SPF, SPR,
              genetic selection and closed-cycle shrimp culture. It will help
create
              opportunities to expand use of exotic shrimp species into environmentally
              sensitive
culture areas. Our company intends to be at the forefront of these
              opportunities.
