This project investigates the construction of a collective
              social identity among elite, white Acadians of south Louisiana. There has been
              a recent surge in efforts of this population to shape a historic heritage and
              to interpret Acadian history. Yet that process must negotiate unacknowledged
              contradictions concerning differences in Francophone residents' notions of
              their history, as well as in African-American participation in that history.
              The researcher will analyze the social identities and historic sites of one
              town, seeking to answer questions concerning the relationship between race,
              class and gender and cultural heritage. Several hypotheses will be tested that
              focus on the how official histories constitute and reinforce notions of racial
              difference, and on the co-existence of vernacular histories that challenge
              official histories. Methods include archival research, structured interviewing,
              social surveys, and participant observation. This project will contribute to
              our understanding of the politics of history making, and inform public
              initiatives in historic preservation and heritage tourism.
