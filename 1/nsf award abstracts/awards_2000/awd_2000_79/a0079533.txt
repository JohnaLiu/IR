Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Mount Holyoke College will acquire a Circular
              Dichroism Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of
              areas including a) conformational studies and spectroscopic characterization of
              model peptides; and b) studies of the structure and properties of
              supramolecular systems inspired by naturally occurring ionophores and molecular
              recognition phenomena.  

Circular dichroism spectroscopy is an extremely
              useful tool in modern analytical chemistry.  It provides a very reliable and
              sensitive method for assigning absolute molecular configurations.  The results
              from these studies will have an impact in a number of areas including materials
              chemistry and biochemistry.
