Abstract    :
              With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF)
              and Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Programs, Peter M. Rentzepis of the
              University of California in Irvine will develop a table top experimental system
              for time-resolved femtosecond to nanosecond X-ray Diffraction and EXAFS in
              solids and liquids.  Such an instrument will combine high repetition rate with
              a high X-ray flux, two ingredients especially needed for high quality EXAFS
              spectra.  The investigator will carry out a number of studies once the
              instrument is up and running, such as grazing incidence experiments on thin
              (sub-nanometer) films, which will yield important information on the thermal
              transport properties of such films, and solution phase EXAFS.  

The
              application of time-resolved X-rays is a frontier in spectroscopy, and could
              have great benefits for the chemical enterprise.  This work will lead to a new
              generation of short pulse X-rays with significant impact in science areas that
              use time-resolved X-ray structure analysis.  This is a new direction in X-ray
              structure analysis insofar as it will provide dynamical information.  The
              development of this user-friendly spectrometer will allow scientists in the
              region to perform research projects in many different disciplines, including
              engineering, materials science, chemistry and biology.
