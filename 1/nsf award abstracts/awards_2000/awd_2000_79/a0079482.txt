Abstract

This project will build a state of the art
              adaptive optics system optimized to image the high spatial frequency structure
              in the solar photosphere and chromosphere. Theoretical magneto-hydrodynamics
              modeling of the solar photosphere using our current understanding of plasma
              physics, predicts that the pressure scale heights and the photon mean free path
              in the magnetized plasma of the solar atmosphere has a physical scale distance
              of 100Km.  Also observations using speckle interferometry of the solar spicules
              which reveal information about the role of magnetic field in energy transport
              between the photosphere and the chromosphere indicate the presence of tightly
              wound plasma fields, unresolved with current telescopes.  High-resolution
              studies of the sun will help us determine 1) how the dynamics of stellar
              atmospheres are driven by the interaction of the magnetic fields with the
              stellar plasma. 2) How magnetic fields are generated and amplified by dynamo
              processes. 3) How the magnetic fields are destroyed. 4) What physical
              mechanisms are responsible for heating the corona, variations in the solar
              constant, triggering flares and coronal mass ejections.  The sun is the nearest
              star to the earth and the only star that can be studied in detail.
