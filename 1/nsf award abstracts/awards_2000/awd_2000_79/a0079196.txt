This Major Research Instrumentation award to Courant Institute
              of New York University provides a clustered workstation environment for
              research and education related to evaluation and testing of General Circulation
              Models, and their application to climate problems. The computer system will be
              part of a new program in Atmosphere-Ocean Sciences at the institute.  The
              project is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF. New York
              University will provide cost-share support for 30% of total project
              costs.
