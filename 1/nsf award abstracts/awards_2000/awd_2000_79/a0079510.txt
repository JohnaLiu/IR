	This award provides partial funding support for the
              development of a multi-user facility for high-pressure infrared spectroscopy
              applied to earth and planetary science research. The facility will consist of a
              dedicated synchrotron beam line source of high-brilliance radiation in the
              infrared to visible spectra region. The facility will be located at port U2A of
              the National Synchrotron Light Source at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.
              The facility will contain a Fourier Transform IR spectrometer along with
              recently developed long working distance microscopes for high-pressure
              applications. Laser and grating spectrometer systems will also permit a variety
              of complementary optical experiments including Raman spectroscopy. The facility
              will permit systematic spectroscopic measurements on samples held at ultra-high
              pressure and temperature conditions that apply to a broad range of research
              problems in earth and planetary sciences.
