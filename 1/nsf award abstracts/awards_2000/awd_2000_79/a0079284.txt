Abstract    :
              With this new award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports
              the work of Dr. JoAnn P. DeLuca at Central Washington University in Ellensburg,
              Washington.   The research aims to investigate the use of ylides as precursors
              for the pyrolytic or photolytic generation of carbene intermediates, and their
              capture by substrates to form stable organic products.   A series of ylides
              will be examined, encompassing a wide range of stabilities, looking for
              correlations between the ability of the ylide to act as a precursor and its
              calculated carbene-nucleophile bond energy.

Carbenes - carbon species like
              R2C: in which R is a carbon or hydrogen and the carbon has a pair of nonbonding
              electrons - are useful intermediates for the formation of a variety of organic
              compounds.   They have usually been generated by heating or uv radiation of
              diazoalkanes or diazirenes, compounds that can be thought of as adducts of a
              carbene with N2.   This project will study ylides, compounds where carbenes are
              combined with other two-electron donors, such as pyridine, in search of better
              precursors for organic synthesis.   The work will include precursor synthesis,
              mechanism studies, and theoretical computations, and provide excellent training
              for the undergraduate and masters degree students involved.   The PI is playing
              a leadership role in involving these students in research and nurturing their
              interest in going on to advanced degrees.
