Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Vassar College will acquire a MALDI-TOF Mass
              Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including a) the identification of trapped intermediates during the refolding
              of tick anticoagulant peptide; b) the identification and characterization of
              organometallic complexes of giant fullerenes; c) the molecular weight
              determination of novel synthetic polymers; and d) the analysis and
              identification of organic archaeological materials.  

Mass spectrometry (MS)
              is a technique used to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the
              molecular compositions of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and
              organometallic molecules. The results from these studies will have an impact in
              a number of areas including materials chemistry, polymer processing and
              biology.
