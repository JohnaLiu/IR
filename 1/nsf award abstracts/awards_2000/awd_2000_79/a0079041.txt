Abstract    :
              This project, conducted by Dr. Paul Flowers and undergraduate students at the
              University of North Carolina at Pembroke, is supported in the Analytical and
              Surface Chemistry program. The research, which is a part of NSF's Research in
              Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) initiative, develops fiber optic
              spectroelectrochemical (FOSEC) sensors and related methodology for potential
              application to various in situ measurements. Specifically the research includes
              1) construction and evaluation of the fiber optic spectroelectrochemical
              sensors for absorbance and fluorescence measurements, 2) characterization of
              the spectroscopic and redox properties of selected analytes, e. g. Cu(II) and
              Cr(VI)  in various solutions , and 3) development and assessment of analytical
              protocols for FOSEC sensor measurement of these analytes.   

This research
              is expected to  lead to  new in situ measurement strategies. Such strategies
              could result in enhanced selectivities, reduced chemical waste, and increased
              versatility when compared to the analytical methods that they replace.
