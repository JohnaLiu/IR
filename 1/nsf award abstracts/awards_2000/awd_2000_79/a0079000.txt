     The investigator and his colleagues develop new theories
              for
the emergence of communication and cooperation among individuals.
They
              focus on theories to explain the evolutionary transitions
from simple
              indexical signals through to iconic and referential
signs and finally to
              symbols and syntax in human language.  These
transitions are related to
              increases in fitness brought about
through natural selection acting on
              communication strategies.
They approach these problems using evolutionary game
              theory and
population dynamics.  The technical objective is to
              discover
evolutionarily stable solutions to language games, such that
              when
all individuals adopt these solutions, no mutant behavior can
invade the
              population under the influence of natural selection.
The challenge is to
              characterize the dynamics of the language
game by specifying a realistic set
              of strategies and payoffs, and
then to analyze the stability properties and
              accessibility of the
equilibrium solutions.  The mathematical equivalence of
              the
game-theoretical replicator equation to the Lotka-Volterra
equation
              offers a large tool box of techniques from nonlinear
dynamics with which to
              explore the games.  They also aim to relate
these results to findings in
              information theory, in particular
the formulation due to Shannon and Weaver
              (1949).  Theoretical
studies of language therefore provide a set of
              fascinating
conceptual and technical challenges, as the strategies
              described
with the models must be rich enough to capture the symbolic
              and
open-ended properties of signals.
     While cooperation and animal
              communication are both areas in
which much important theoretical work has been
              conducted, few
attempts have been made to bring them together.  The study
              of
language provides an important focus for such a synthesis.
Theoretical
              studies of the evolution of animal communication have
stressed extravagant and
              costly ornamentation, using Darwin's
theory of sexual selection, whereas
              evolutionary approaches to
language tend to be represented by studies in
              historical
linguistics within human societies.  It is the objective of
              this
project to occupy the center ground and provide a theoretical
bridge
              between these two disciplines.  Thus the work is neither a
study of animal
              signals and cooperation nor a mathematical
investigation of human syntax and
              grammar, but rather an attempt
to reconstruct the continuous series of stages
              through which
evolution might have proceeded from one to the other.  The
              project
does not not attempt to explain the glorious intricacies of
              human
grammar studied by linguists, such as in X-bar theory.  Instead
              it
focusses on simple design features of animal communication and
human
              language and attempts to describe their evolution in
mathematical terms. 
              These probably antedated grammar, phrase
structure, anaphora and related
              linguistic constructs, and
thereby provide some biological foundations upon
              which these
later concepts might rest.
