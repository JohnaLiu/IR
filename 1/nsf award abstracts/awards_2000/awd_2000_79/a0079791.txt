Abstract    :
              The Doppler on Wheels (DOW) program at the University of Oklahoma (in close
              collaboration with the National Center for Atmospheric Research) has developed
              single beam, mobile Doppler radars.  These have enabled the collection of very
              high resolution Doppler data on a variety of meteorological phenomena including
              tornadoes and convective storms in mountains.  These data have allowed major
              advances to be made in the atmospheric sciences.

Under the NSF Major
              Research Instrumentation program, the Principal Investigator will develop an
              advanced, five-beam mobile Doppler radar.  This will allow researchers to
              acquire rapid scan Doppler radar information at higher temporal resolution than
              previously possible.

There is a compelling need for three-dimensional
              Doppler radar observations on short time scales.  Tornadoes, small-scale
              boundary layer structures in hurricanes, microbursts and other phenomena evolve
              on time scales that are unobservable using traditional radars.  

An
              innovative design will permit rapid-scan observations using a hybrid
              electronic/mechanical scanning system with multiple simultaneous transmit and
              receive beams.  This instrument will be used by researchers to open up new
              avenues of research.
