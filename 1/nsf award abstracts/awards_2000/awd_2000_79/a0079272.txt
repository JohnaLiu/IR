Abstract    :
              With this award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry program supports the
              work of Dr. Silas C. Blackstock in the Department of Chemistry at the
              University of Alabama Tuscaloosa.   The work involves the synthesis and study
              of macromolecular organic poly redox arrays involving spin alignment in new
              non-Kekule pi-systems, and charge transport along redox chains.   Medium
              effects on the energy ordering of the polyradical ion spin states will also be
              determined.   Parallel work will investigate charge transport in new dendridic
              poly redox structures with radial redox gradients.

Poly radicals, organic
              compounds with two or more unpaired electron spins, will be studied using
              electrochemistry, nuclear magnetic resonance, electron spin resonance, and
              theoretical computations, looking for interesting electrical and magnetic
              properties.   Dendrimeric structures with redox active elements that change as
              one goes from the center to the periphery are expected to behave as charge
              funnel devices, and have a potential use as novel charge storage
              nano-components in redox-imaging media.   The work is expected to provide
              valuable training for students in synthesis, instrumental measurements, and
              chemical computation.
