Abstract    :
              	This project involves a theoretical and empirical study of the role played by
              international law in the management and resolution of international security
              disputes.  Hypotheses are developed to answer two central questions.  First,
              what impact do principles of international law have on the diplomatic and
              military policies of states that are involved in territorial disputes with
              other states?  Second, how do principles of international law influence the
              positions taken by third parties toward territorial disputes and whether they
              intervene to support one of the disputants?  A systematic test of theoretical
              propositions is conducted using statistical analyses of an original dataset of
              the population of territorial disputes from 1900 to 2000.  The results of this
              project should make important theoretical contributions to understanding the
              domestic and international conditions that help to determine whether states and
              international institutions are influenced strongly by principles of
              international law.  Empirically, the systematic and wide-ranging tests should
              provide a strong basis for drawing generalizable conclusions about the causal
              effects of international law in international security affairs and, in
              particular, whether international law plays a central role in the
              conflict-resolution policies of democratic states.
