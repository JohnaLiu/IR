              Summary

The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of
              Massachusetts, Amherst proposes to purchase one SGI four-processor machine, one
              le server, ten X-terminals, a color laser printer, and site licenses for Maple
              and Matlab which will be dedicated to the support of research for the projects
              proposed here. We also request funding for partial support for one professional
              system administrator to setup and maintain this equipment. A specic list of the
              projects are as follows:

Computations in Algebraic Geometry: hypergeometric
              functions, toric varieties, enumerative geometry (Eduardo Cattani, David Cox,
              Frank Sottile)

Computational Number Theory: numerical and graphical
              investigations of Artin L -functions (David Hayes, Siman Wong)

Mesoscopic
              theories and hybrid computational algorithms in materials science and uid
              mechanics (David Horntrop, Markos Katsoulakis, Bruce Turkington)

Geometry,
              Computation and Visualization: minimal, constant-mean curvature, and Willmore
              surfaces in 3 and 4 dimensions (Robert Kusner, Nicholas Schmitt)

The
              University of Massachusetts, Amherst will contribute cost sharing of 50% of the
              amount of this purchase, and will assume the full personnel costs after NSF
              funding ends.
