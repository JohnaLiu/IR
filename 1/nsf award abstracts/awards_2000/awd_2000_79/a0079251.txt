Abstract    :
              The PIs propose to concentrate the study in three elements of physics beyond the
              standard model: non-baryonic dark matter, negative-pressure dark energy in the
              universe, and cosmic microwave background radiation. The proposed work will
              focus on producing theories, models, and calculations for comparison with
              experimental results in order to achieve a coherent picture of the physics,
              which governs the universe.
