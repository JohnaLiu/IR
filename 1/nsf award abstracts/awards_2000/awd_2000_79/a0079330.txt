The University of
              Rhode Island will purchase a digital camera, interface equipment and image
              analysis software to provide direct digital imagining capability for the JEOL
              1200 EX Scanning/Transmission Electron Microscope (S/TEM).  The equipment will
              be used initially for a series of research projects representing
              interdisciplinary collaborations between Is in the Chemical Engineering,
              Biomedical Sciences, Mechanical Engineering and Physics departments at URI as
              well as the Chemical Engineering Department at Tulane University.  These
              include (a) time-solved cryo-TEM experiments on microstructure evolution in
              mixed cationic/anionic surfactant systems, (b) examination of morphologies of
              lipid/peptide assemblies, determination of specific locations of model membrane
              proteins in lipid bilayers and swollen micelles (imaged using cryo-TEM) that
              will expose their functionalities, (c) determination of microstructures
              (cryo-TEM in newly discovered hydrogels that have nearly equal amounts of water
              and organic phase (d) SEM examination of fracture surfaces of a new class of
              composite materials made from polymers with cenosphere fillers, and (e)
              morphology, size distribution and aggregation characteristics of magnetic
              nanoparticles (TEM).  Digital imaging and analysis will dramatically increase
              the efficiency and quality of utilization of the electron microscope, and have
              a critical impact far beyond the specific projects outlined.  It will make the
              electron microscope available as a powerful educational tool for students from
              several departments in the university, and allow then to gain expertise in a
              vital technique for colloid, materials science and biological observations.
