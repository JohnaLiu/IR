Instabilities of
              fluid motions represent a large and a fundamentally important branch of fluid
              dynamics.  The PI has proposed to investigate a novel class of instabilities:
              those which occur in the narrow plumes of positively-or-negatively-buoyant
              fluid within a large body of the host fluid.  

The density gradients
              associated with the buoyancy permit schlieren observations of the plume
              behavior and this technique will be used to examine the coiling (or chiral) and
              the axisymmetric instabilities.  These experiments will be correlated with
              theoretical considerations that are used to establish the parameters that will
              lead to the breakdown of the basic state.
