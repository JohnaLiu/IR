Abstract    :
              A tri-laser confocal microscope will be placed in a state-of-the-art biological 
              imaging resource in the Integrated  Microscopy Core  (IMC), Department  of 
              Molecular  & Cellular  Biology  (MCB) at  Baylor College  of Medicine  (BCM).  
               Laser scanning confocal microscopy fills an important niche in structural
              biology by providing much higher resolution images from fixed or lives
              fluorescently labeled specimens through aperture-based removal of out-of-focus
              light. Research will be conducted in cell and molecular biology and will
              include research on the structural basis of mitosis in eukaryotic cells, cell
              signaling, pattern formation, developmental biology of a wide variety of
              organisms, transcription factor function and nuclear organization.   

The
              improved IMC will serve the MCB faculty  (83) and trainees  (72 students; 123
              postdocs), and as throughout its 25 year history, also will be available to
              investigators and students throughout Baylor, including numerous outreach
              programs for young scientists and minority groups.  This instrument will
              greatly enhance the ability to perform biological imaging at Baylor, and will
              serve as a shared resource throughout the Texas Medical Center.
