The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC)
              at Carnegie Mellon University supports an interdisciplinary research program on
              grain boundary networks in polycrystals,  called The Mesoscale Interface
              Mapping Project.  The group research seeks to advance the understanding of
              grain boundary systems by developing and applying experimental and analytical
              techniques, including automated orientation imaging microscopy, to determine
              the structure, evolution and properties of grain boundaries in metals and
              ceramics.  The Center also provides seed support for emerging research
              opportunities.

The Center supports well maintained shared experimental
              facilities that provide specialized instrumentation for the preparation and
              characterization of bulk materials and surfaces.  Education and human resources
              development efforts include curriculum development collaborations with
              Pittsburgh area high schools, and a Collaborative to Integrate Research and
              Education with Florida A&M University that includes undergraduate curriculum
              development and joint research projects.  The Center also has extensive
              research collaborations with industrial and government laboratories, and with
              other universities in the U.S. and abroad.

Participants in the Center
              currently include 10 senior investigators, 1 postdoctoral associates, 10
              graduate students, 5 undergraduates and 2 technicians and other support
              personnel.   Professor Gregory Rohrer directs the MRSEC.
