Abstract    :
              The purpose of this project is to empirically evaluate the roles of poverty,
              commercialization, population pressure, and property right/resource management
              mechanisms on the sustainability of local forest resources in the middle
              Himalayan region in Northern India.  It will involve collection and analysis of
              data from approximately 100 villages in the two states of Uttar Pradesh and
              Himachal Pradesh.  The first stage will involve estimating individual
              household-level 'demand' for common forest resources, as a function of
              household demographic and economic characteristics, and village level variables
              such as prices of complementary and substitute products, market access,
              property rights system, and local governance/enforcement mechanisms.  These
              demand systems will be used to obtain reduced form estimates for aggregate
              village use of common forest resources as a function of village
              characteristics.  The second stage of the project will investigate determinants
              of local governance and enforcement mechanisms.
