Abstract    :
              Elemental analysis instrumentation will support the current and future research
              and education needs of California State University, San Marcos (CSUSM), a
              rapidly growing, minority-serving university in north San Diego County,
              California. The instrumentation includes: (1) a flow injection ion analyzer for
              the rapid and routine analysis of ions in seawater and brackish water (nitrate,
              nitrite, ammonium, silicate, ortho-phosphate, total nitrogen, and total
              phosphorus) and soil and/or plant samples (ortho-phosphate, total phosphate,
              and total Kjeldahl nitrogen) and (2) a flame atomic absorption spectrometer for
              the quantitative measurement of metals and cations in water, soil, skeletal,
              and tissue samples.

Users of these instruments include biology faculty,
              graduate (M.S.) students and advanced undergraduate students.  Projects include
              research on nutrient cycling in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. This
              equipment will substantially increase the research, research training, and
              educational capabilities of the CSUSM ecology and environmental science
              programs. This instrumentation is the first stage in equipping the new
              elemental analysis facility which will increase opportunities for external
              funding of research and research training initiatives, and enhance
              collaborative partnerships in the region.
