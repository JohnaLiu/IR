CADRE:  A
              Robotic Control Network for Distributed Experimentation

Santa Clara
              University is developing a Distributed Robotic Control Network for use as an
              experimental control system for a variety of remote, unmanned robotic devices. 
              This system supports the operation of remote robots with scientific and
              technology demonstration missions.  In addition, the system permits
              experimental verification and validation of new operational control techniques.
               The control network will consist of a centralized mission control center,
              several low-cost communications stations, a Web-based user interface for
              distributed users, interfacility communications links, and a few low-cost test
              robots that can be used to demonstrate system functionality.  The system will
              be designed and implemented to specifically support the work of geographically
              distributed researchers.
