Abstract    :
              Professor Charles Knobler of the University of California Los Angeles is
              supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program to perform
              experimental and theoretical studies on phase behaviors of organic monolayers
              on water.    Using monolayers and methods including Brewster-angle microscopy,
              grazing incidence x-ray diffraction and scanning force microscopy, the PI
              proposes to study the molecular origins of sliding friction and also the
              kinetics of phase transitions.  The collapse of monolayers into three
              dimensional structures will also be investigated.  The work is collaborative
              with the Applied Mathematics department at UCLA and with international groups
              including two at Saclay, France and MPI, Golm, Germany. 

Monolayers serve as
              model systems for the more complicated biological membranes, and also allow one
              to study phase transformations in two dimensions, which is a tractable problem
              from a theoretical standpoint.   The measurements will have bearing on similar
              phenomena in liquid crystals, adsorbed atoms on surfaces, liquid crystalline
              polymers and antiferromagnets.   There are applications of this work to
              problems in lubrication and sensors.
