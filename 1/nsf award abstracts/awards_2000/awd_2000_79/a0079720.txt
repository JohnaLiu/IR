This Major Research Instrumentation award to Woods Hole
              Oceanographic Institution provides funds for development of an advanced network
              communications system for implementation in a deep-ocean fiber-optic cable
              observatory system.  The goal of the project is to develop, using
              commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) data networking technology, a robust system
              capable of two-way packetized communications at multiple Gbit/s rates over an
              observatory network cable several hundred kilometers in length, and including
              numerous nodes for seafloor observations and experiments. The development
              effort includes fabrication and wet testing of a fault tolerant seafloor
              communications and control node. The project was reviewed and supported
              collaboratively at NSF by the Division of Ocean Sciences in the Directorate for
              Geosciences, the Division of Advanced Networking Infrastructure and Research of
              the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, together
              with the Office of Polar Programs. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and
              their industry partner, Cisco Systems, Inc., will provide cost-share support
              for 34% of total project costs.
