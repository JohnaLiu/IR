MRI:  Acquisition of a
              Complete Whole Arm Manipulator (WAM) Robot System

The goal of this work is
              to acquire a whole arm manipulator (WAM) robot which will greatly enhance the
              development of the medical robotics program, combining haptic and visual
              information for object exploration in unstructured environment.  The robot will
              also be an invaluable tool for developing and testing novel nonlinear control
              models at Drexel University.  The equipment will also have significant impact
              on the undergraduate and graduate education at Drexel in the mentioned research
              areas.
