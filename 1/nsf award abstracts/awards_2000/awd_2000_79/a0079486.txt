Abstract    :
              This Major Research Infrastructure (MRI) award will provide instrumentation for
              atmospheric research at Storm Peak Laboratory (SPL). The instruments will focus
              on measurements of the physical characterization of the atmospheric particle
              size distribution over the complete size range from aerosol of diameter a few
              tens of nanometers up to and including cloud droplets. SPL, operated by the
              Desert Research Institute (DRI), is a mountain-top atmospheric research and
              teaching facility located at 3220 m elevation in the Colorado Rocky Mountains.
              The site is accessible year-round to researchers and educators who require an
              instrumented site in the middle troposphere to study the atmosphere and its
              physical, chemical, and biological properties. This project will permanently
              equip SPL with a set of instrumentation in the areas of research and teaching
              conducted by the principal investigators. An enhanced research focus will be
              developed regarding the mechanisms of aerosol interactions with physical,
              chemical, and radiative processes in the atmosphere.
