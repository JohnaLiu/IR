Abstract    :
              Amy Mullin of Boston University is supported by a grant from the Experimental
              Physical Chemistry Program to continue and extend her studies of the effect of
              internal energy on collisional relaxation and reactivity for highly excited
              polyatomic molecules.  Pulsed uv laser absorption will be used to excite the
              molecules and transient ir absorption will monitor the internal energy
              distributions to determine the energy transfer and reactive cross-sections. 
              Specific studies to be conducted are: (1) energy dependence of super elastic
              collisions (pyrazine by carbon dioxide), (2) the influence of quenching species
              on collisional relaxation (pyrazine and pyridine by water and carbon dioxide),
              (3) theoretical modeling of superelastic relaxation using trajectory
              calculations to determine energy gain by the quenching species (the system in
              (1) and pyridine, 2-picoline and 2,6-lutidine with water) and (4) influence of
              excitation on chemical reactivity (benzene with a series of
              radicals).

Activate molecules play an important role in chemistry and
              biochemistry at many levels in influencing the reactivity. This work will show
              how specific excitation of molecules by laser radiation can be dissipated,
              influence the rates of reactions and can appear as excitation in the reaction
              products.  The data will be used to test theories of energy relaxation in
              molecules.
