MRI:  Development of Brain Tissue Scanner

The proposed study
              is a pilot study for imaging the microstructure of brain tissue to visualize
              brain development and connectivity.  The brain tissue scanner, a new instrument
              for mapping brain microstructure, will be developed for the rapid and massive
              data acquisition necessary to investigate cytoarchitectural developmental
              patterns of mammalian brain.  Volume scanning rates of 1 teravoxel/day are
              anticipated.
