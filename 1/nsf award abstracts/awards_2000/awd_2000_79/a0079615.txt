PI: Craig R. M. McKenzie

The theme of the
              proposed research is that everyday inferential behavior is much more accurate
              than previously thought.  People are not general-purpose inference machines,
              but are instead adapted to the structure of the environment in which they
              typically operate.  This allows them to exploit strategies that are both simple
              and accurate.  The proposed experiments examine the role of an important
              environmental feature: The extent to which a datum, or observation, is rare or
              unexpected.  Rare observations are more informative than common ones, and
              people appear to make strong assumptions about what kinds of events are rare. 
              These assumptions make sense outside of the laboratory and help explain many
              previous findings and lead to new predictions.  The proposed experiments
              examine in detail people's sensitivity to rarity and the implications for
              several areas of research on thinking and reasoning.
