Abstract    :
              Professors Gina Hoatson and Robert Vold of the College of William and Mary are
              funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry program to perform experimental
              Nuclear Magnetic Resonance studies on disordered solids.  One project involves
              study of the structure, disorder and dynamics of amino acids and cyclic
              dipeptides in the solid crystalline form and as complexes in the hydrophobic
              cavities of cyclodextrin.   The latter environment is intended as a model for
              biological systems. The issue of disorder in peptides and proteins is important
              since a number of systems such as amyloidiogenic proteins and membrane proteins
              all show significant disorder and are to date difficult to study.  The other
              project involves the investigation of inorganic ferroelectrics.  Some of these
              materials display exceptional piezoelectric and electronic properties, and the
              origin of these affects is not understood.  Studies of mixed perovskites will
              test the hypothesis that ion disorder and motion are responsible for the
              unusual dielectric effects.  The PIs propose to measure dynamic line shape and
              relaxation 2H NMR  and 13C-15N REDOR distance measurements on the organic
              complexes.  They also propose to use 93Nb/45Sc high resolution MQMAS studies on
              the inorganic relaxors.  

This work will allow understanding of the
              macroscopic behaviors of two classes of disordered solids, based on
              measurements that give microscopic details.  The host-guest chemistry will be
              of interest to protein structure chemists, as they attempt to understand the
              structures of the many proteins still not solved.  The perovskite work has
              potential impact on the development of new ceramic electronics materials. 
              There is a considerable component in this work dedicated to developing new
              nuclear magnetic resonance methods that ultimately could be of benefit in the
              health and materials fields.
