MRI: 
              Acquisition of Equipment for Quantum Information Processing

The focus of
              this proposal is acquisition of a Hitachi S-4700-II field emission scanning
              electron microscope (FESEM) with resolution (secondary emission mode) of 1.5nm
              at 15kV.  The proposed equipment will help make an optical communications
              receiver and transmitter technology that can transfer quantum coherence and
              entanglement from photons, to spins in a semiconductor and back to photons
              again.  Since the photo-electron spin is reasonable long-lived, the quantum
              information can be stored and act as quantum memory.  If this technology is
              successful, it can become the front end for more complex semiconductor based
              quantum processors in the future, perhaps even a full-fledged quantum computer.
