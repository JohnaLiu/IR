Abstract    :
              Animals lose water through a variety of avenues, including evaporation from the
              skin surface, respiratory water loss and excretory water loss.  It has long
              been known that insects may be particularly vulnerable to rapid water loss due
              to their small size and their occurrence in dry environments, including (stored
              grain, deserts, saline waters, etc.).  This project includes studies on the
              mechanisms of water regulation in populations of the fruit fly, Drosophila
              melanogaster, which have undergone selection for more than 200 generations for
              increased resistance to dry environments.  Use of fruit flies that have
              undergone selection for resistance to dry environments provides several
              experimental advantages.  Selection leads to large physiological differences in
              a single species, allowing detailed physiological comparisons to be carried
              out.  The history of the populations is known, as is the timing of the
              processes by which the physiological changes have occurred.  Finally by
              conducting these studies with fruit flies, a vast array of molecular and
              genetic techniques becomes available for studying the mechanisms of water
              regulation in insects.  Such work may be very helpful in developing techniques
              for interfering with water balance in insect pest species, in the production of
              new non-toxic insecticides, and in the discovery of novel insect control
              strategies.
