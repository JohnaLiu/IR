Abstract    :
              This is an infrastructure-building award designed to enhance access to research
              and teaching materials in constitutional law and constitutional history.  The
              PIs will provide a free, searchable, internet-accessible web site containing
              major Supreme Court briefs, oral arguments, and related materials over the
              course of the Court's history. Initial case selection will be made by scholars
              and librarians at Yale and the Supreme Court Historical Society.  Copies of the
              briefs, oral arguments, and related materials will then be transferred to
              electronic format by a data conversion service. The web site will have several
              significant advantages over current printed and electronic versions, including
              full searchability, easy accessibility, and easy citability. Cases will be
              selected in accordance with their historical importance  by criteria that can
              be evaluated at the web site.
