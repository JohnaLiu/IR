              Muybridge:  A Repository for Human Motion Data

Despite their age, Eadweard
              Muybridge's extensive collection of filmstrips of human motion still serve as a
              useful resource for researchers.  This project is creating a modern analog to
              Muybridge's filmstrips using current techniques for measurement, display, and
              distribution.  Recent technological advances in motion capture equipment make
              it possible to record three-dimensional joint angle data of a human subject
              with high fidelity, resolution, and consistency.  This project is recording
              motions such as walking, running, jumping, and gesturing using modern
              equipment.  The world-wide web and the growing capacity and declining cost of
              disk drives allows this data repository to be easily distributed to researchers
              in fields including computer graphics, robotics, computer vision, and
              biomechanics.
