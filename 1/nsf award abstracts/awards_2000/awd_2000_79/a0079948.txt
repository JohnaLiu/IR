Abstract    :
              The foci of this research are twofold.  First, methodology will be developed for
              the enantioselective incorporation of simple olefins such as ethylene and
              propylene into prochiral molecules.  Second, new strategies will be developed
              for intramolecular coupling of alpha, omega-dienes and alpha, omega-diynes for
              the synthesis of carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds.

With this renewal
              award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the
              research of Dr. Thaliyil V. RajanBabu of the Department of Chemistry at Ohio
              State University.  Professor RajanBabu will focus his work on developing highly
              selective carbon-carbon bond forming reactions based on catalytic activation of
              neutral molecules.  The research has potential broader impacts for
              pharmaceutical, agricultural and materials science and provides an excellent
              milieu for the training of graduate students.
