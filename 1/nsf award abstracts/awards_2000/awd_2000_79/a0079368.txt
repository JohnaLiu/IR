Abstract    :
              
This project explores the role of values in determining individuals' diffuse
              support for the Supreme Court. Implementing an experimental survey design, the
              PI will measure diffuse support for political institutions with feeling
              thermometers. The following values will be examined: liberty, equality,
              morality and social order. Some individuals, it is hypothesized, will prefer a
              decision reflecting one value, whereas others will prefer a decision reflecting
              another value. The research protocol will test whether the value frame
              influences diffuse support for the Court by measuring support for the Court
              after administering the hypothetical scenario and assessing whether or not it
              has fluctuated over the course of the experiment.
