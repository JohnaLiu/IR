Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Emory
              University will acquire a computer system for computational chemistry and
              chemical physics.  This equipment will enhance research in the following areas:
               a) computational studies of reactions of O+, N+, O2+, N2+ with neutral
              molecules; b) photodecomposition reactions of small gas phase molecules; c)
              interfacing multimode to electronic structure codes; d) hydrocarbon combustion;
              e) chemistry important to propulsion systems; e) gas-surface reactions on
              silicon; f) spectroscopy and dynamics of van der Waals complexes; g)
              calibration and applications of the ONION method to transition metal complexes;
              h) gas-phase reactions of transition metal atoms, ions and clusters; i)
              reactions of transition metal complexes and full homogeneous catalytic cycles;
              j) force-field energy-free conformational analysis; k) friction and
              nanotribology; l) computational neuroscience; and m) pattern formation.  

A
              cluster of fast, modern computer workstations is vital to serving the computing
              needs of active research departments. Such a "computer network" also serves as
              a development environment for new theoretical codes and algorithms, provides
              state-of-the-art graphics and visualization facilities, and supports research
              in state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing.  These studies will
              have a significant impact in a number of areas, including biochemistry and
              materials sciences.
