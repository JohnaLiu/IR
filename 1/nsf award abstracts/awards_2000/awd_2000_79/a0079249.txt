The PI has discovered that Cns1 is an essential
              co-chaperone that physically and functionally interacts with the Hsp90 complex
              of proteins. The Cns1-Hsp90 interaction is direct, being mediated via the
              tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat of Cns1 and the carboxy terminus of Hsp90. The
              PI has isolated temperature-sensitive alleles of CNS1 that are
              temperature-sensitive for growth. Several of the temperature-sensitive
              mutations at CNS1 abolish in vitro interactions between Cns1 and Hsp90. Because
              both Hsp90 and Cns1 are essential, this provides circumstantial evidence that
              the Hsp90-CnsI physical interaction is essential. Confirmation of this would be
              a major new discovery in the molecular chaperone field as none of the
              Hsp90-cochaperone interactions investigated to date have been shown to be
              essential. In this project, the PI will use suppressor genetics to identify
              mutations that restore the ability of cns1-ts cells to grow at the restrictive
              temperature. One class of mutations is expected to identify key sites in Hsp90
              that restore interactions with Cns1-ts proteins at the restrictive temperature.
              In vivo and in vitro confirmation of these restored physical interactions would
              provide proof that the interaction between Hsp90 and Cns1 is essential for
              life. In addition, the general genetic approach is expected to yield the
              identification of other essential proteins that interact with Hsp90 and/or
              Cns1, and thus enhance our understanding of essential molecular interactions
              involving these chaperones and co-chaperones.
Proper growth control and
              development in all organisms depends upon the regulation of proteins that play
              central roles transducing signals that the cell receives from its environment.
              Molecular chaperones are proteins that help signal transducing proteins to
              achieve a three-dimensional state from which they can most efficiently transmit
              signals that ultimately change the profile of gene expression of the cell. Two
              highly investigated molecular chaperones are heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and
              heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), so-called because of the original discovery that
              their abundance in the cell increases upon heat treatment. Although the role
              that Hsp70 plays in helping proteins fold into their proper configuration is
              well established, the precise role(s) played by Hsp90 in molecular chaperoning
              is (are) not well-known, despite the investigation of many groups over the last
              decade. This PI has developed a system by which the most important in vivo role
              of Hsp90, i.e., the role(s) it plays that is (are) essential to cell viability,
              can be investigated using yeast genetics. The goal of this investigation is to
              identify physical interactions involving Hsp90, a newly discovered protein
              partner of Hsp90 called Cns1, and other proteins that are required for the life
              of the cell. By establishing the molecular identity of these proteins and
              details of their physical associations, the essential role played by Hsp90 in
              vivo will become clearer.
