Abstract    :
              Professor David Jonas of the University of Colorado is funded by the
              Experimental Physical Chemistry program to develop femtosecond multidimensional
              spectroscopic methods.  2D electronic spectra developed already by the PI
              allows the examination of solvation dynamics as a function of solvent
              coordination in liquid methanol.  This proposal seeks to further develop the
              method and use it to study the doubly excited states of the photosynthetic
              reaction center and vibrationally excited molecules.  These excited state
              absorptions usually remain obscure in standard pump-probe methods.  The PI then
              proposes to examine the apparently long-lived heterogeneity reported in
              photosynthetic energy and electron transfer.   A successful outcome of this
              proposal would be new methods adaptable to many problems in condensed phase
              dynamics.   

Most practical and industrially important chemical reactions
              occur in condensed phases such as liquids, yet little is known how the solvent
              affects the course of the reactions.  Ultrafast dynamics experiments reveal
              some of the step by step details of reactions in solution.  These fundamental
              studies underlie many of the advances in synthetic chemistry and materials
              science.  Applications of the new multidimensional spectroscopic methods will
              shed light on fast biological processes involved in energy conversion.
