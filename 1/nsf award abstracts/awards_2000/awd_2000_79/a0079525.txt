Abstract    :
              This Major Research Instrumentation award is for the acquisition of a high
              performance computing cluster to facilitate the study of solar-terrestrial
              physics at the University of New Hampshire's Institute for the Study of Earth,
              Oceans, and Space (EOS).  The computing equipment will support studies related
              to the Geospace Environment Modeling program and the National Space Weather
              Program.  The primary challenge of these programs is to model the flow of
              energy from coronal mass ejections on the sun via the solar wind, through
              Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere, ultimately resulting in atmospheric
              heating, electrical currents, and auroral displays over the polar regions.  The
              proposed facility will consist of a high-performance compute engine, data
              storage, and archiving hardware.  The goal is to develop a user-friendly
              facility freely available to senior scientists, postdocs, and graduates
              students within the participating research groups.  The facility will enhance
              efforts to simulate and model the solar terrestrial environment, facility the
              analysis of large volume data sets from multiple experimental programs, and aid
              the characterization of existing and developing instrumentation by providing a
              platform for generating instrument simulations with high statistics.
