The
              objectives of this research project are to initiate the first survey and
              inventory of tree canopy biodiversity for myxomycetes, macrofungi, mosses,
              liverworts, and lichens in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  The
              research team will include a multidisciplinary research team including experts
              in non-vascular plants from the US and Sweden, graduate and undergraduate
              students, and volunteers.  The research is focused on searching for undescribed
              taxa, comparisons of tree canopy dwelling cryptogams, and collection and
              curation of little-known assemblages of treetop biodiversity.  The research
              will help document the tree canopy biodiversity in tree species rapidly
              declining due to insect and fungal pathogens, and atmospheric pollution.
