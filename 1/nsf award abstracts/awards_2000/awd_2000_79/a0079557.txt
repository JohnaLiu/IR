MRI: 
              Acquisition of Immersive WorkWall System for Campus-wide Visualization
              Research

This proposal requests funds to provide Southern Illinois
              University at Edwardsville with the visualization capabilities of an Immersive
              WorkWall System.  The particular Immersive WorkWall consists of a single screen
              stereoscopic projection system and a workstation rendering dual graphic images
              onto a six by eight foot screen.  Viewers wearing special glasses experience
              real depth effects.  The new equipment capability will significantly enhance
              the on-going research activities concerning animated simulation models of
              scientific and engineering concepts.
