Abstract    :
              The Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) at Brown
              University supports an interdisciplinary research program on the mechanics of
              materials at the atomistic and microstructural level.  The research is carried
              out in one interdisciplinary research group, with appropriate seed projects. 
              Within the IRG one major thrust is the study of the effect of stress on the
              performance of electronic nanostructures and nanodevices.  This research has
              potential impact on understanding how stress effects the design and performance
              of atomic scale sized lasers and electronic devices.  The experimental results
              are modeled using the quasicontinuum model developed at Brown.  The second
              thrust in the IRG is concerned with the investigation of the micromechanics of
              materials with complex microstructures.  Emphasis is on the interface between
              two types of systems such as bicrystals of aluminum, aluminum alloy, and
              synthetic bimaterials.  Computational techniques closely support the
              experimental efforts.  The center is engaged in a variety of educational
              activities, notably the development aterials science teaching modules aimed at
              the high school level and the training of secondary teachers in use of the
              modules.  The Center supports well maintained shared experimental facilities,
              which are accessible to outside users and also supports interactive efforts
              with industry and other sectors.

Participants in the Center include 17
              senior investigators, 3 postdoctoral associates, 14 graduate students, 10
              undergraduates, and 6 technicians and other support personnel.  Professor Clyde
              L. Briant directs the MRSEC.
