This project investigates the formation of a new middle
              class in the Indonesia, a developing country that has experienced rapid
              economic growth. Focusing on the societal elites who create the nation's
              influential mass media, this research examines how private television producers
              (appealing to new social tastes) are creating and manipulating a new middle
              class culture where none had previously existed. It will specifically look at
              the media predominance of various societal forces including nationalism,
              consumerism, and religion in that culture. Methods include participant
              observation, analysis of TV production systems and seven popular TV programs,
              and the collection of demographic data. This project will contribute to our
              understanding of the development of class structures, as well as a national
              culture and national identity, in an ethnically and linguistically diverse
              modern state.
