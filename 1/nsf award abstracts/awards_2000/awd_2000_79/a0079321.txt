Equipment is requested for electromagnetic
              compatibility (EMC) research and education in digital and power electronics. 
              Undesirable electromagnetic interference (EMI) and signal degradation that
              results from switching digital devices is a critical design issue in high-speed
              digital electronics.  EMI is also a dominant problem in power electronics where
              large voltages and currents are switched rapidly.  EMI from one system can
              cause malfunctioning in other near-by electronics, as well as interfere with
              wireless technologies.  Further, ensuring signal integrity within a high-speed
              design is essential to functionality.  The rapid advance of device technologies
              has overtaken the state of knowledge of design - basic physics, and design
              methodologies - for meeting the many EMC challenges with future ultra-fast
              digital electronics, and power electronics based systems.  Further, there are
              too few engineers to meet the needs for addressing these issues.  The new
              equipment will facilitate current industry-sponsored research, and expand
              opportunities for ultra-fast differential signaling applications in computers,
              data switching, broadband internet technologies, and wireless communications. 
              Five senior level undergraduate electives, and two graduate courses will be
              impacted, as well as educational initiatives in an NSF IGERT program.  The
              proposed equipment will build on existing strengths for expanding EMC research
              and education in high-speed digital electronics and power electronics
              systems.
