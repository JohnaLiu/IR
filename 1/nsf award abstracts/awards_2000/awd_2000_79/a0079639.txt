MRI:  Development of
              a Next-Generation Ultrasound Research Platform

This application proposes the
              development of an advanced experimental system to support ultrasonic imaging
              research.  The proposed system will be capable of continuing acquisition over a
              period of 1.6 seconds, the equivalent of roughly 50 image frames. The system
              will also incorporate a data interface to allow future connection to custom
              processing units, ultimately enabling real-time processing of aperture domain
              data. The system will be constructed around AgilentTechnologies SONOS 5500
              ultrasonic imaging system to enable real-time imaging and preserve broad signal
              bandwitdth, high signal to noise ration, and wide dynamic range.
