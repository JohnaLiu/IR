Description:  This award supports the participation of 20 U.S.
              scientists and engineers at a US-India Workshop: Learning, Optimization, and
              Adaptation, Kerala, December 2000.  Professors Sean Meyn, University of
              Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and A. Krishnamoorty of Cochin University of
              Science and Technology will hold a workshop on stochastic optimization and
              adaptive control.  Its purpose is to bring researchers from diverse fields
              together to learn of new methods for analyzing and controlling complex systems;
              to advance the mathematical foundations of systems theory; and to learn more
              about current related technological problems in the information sciences.     
              

Scope:  Participants include scientists and engineers from Government and
              Industry, Academia in India and the U.S., and students.  The workshop is hosted
              by the University of Cochin with support from the Government of India agencies
              including the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and the Council on
              Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).   The workshop is designed to foster
              future bilateral collaborations.  The Division of Electrical and Communications
              Systems has provided joint funding for this workshop with the Division of
              International Programs.
