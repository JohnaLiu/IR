Abstract    :
              We propose to continue our theoretical and experimental research studying
              Quantal Response Equilibria (QRE), a statistical model of equilibrium behavior
              in games.  The key feature of the equilibrium is that individuals do not always
              play best responses to the strategies of their opponents, but play better
              strategies with higher probability than worse strategies.  Here we propose to
              apply QRE to three different areas of application:  auctions, voting, and
              information aggregation.  Several different series of experiments are planned,
              including large-scale experiments (100+ subjects) to test theoretical
              predictions about information aggregation and strategic voting in large groups.
               On the theoretical side, we propose to extend the model to dynamic settings to
              incorporate learning and repeated play, and to generalize the error structure
              to allow for correlation across moves.  There is also a computational part of
              the proposal.  Specifically, we plan to extend our current algorithms for
              computing QRE in several ways, to allow more efficient computation of
              equilibria in certain kinds of larger games and to allow for estimation in
              models with more general error structures.
