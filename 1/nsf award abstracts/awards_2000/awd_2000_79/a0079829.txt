Abstract    :
              This grant supports the acquisition of a multichannel microwave radiometer as an
              addition to the University of Alabama Mobile Integrated Profiling System
              (MIPS).   Manufactured by Radiometrics, Inc., the Model TP/WPV-3000 radiometer
              employs seven channels near the 60 GHZ oxygen absorption line for temperature
              profiling and five channels near the 22 GHz water vapor line for humidity
              profiling.  The current capability of MIPS enables the measurement of wind and
              radar reflectivity to 5 km using a UHF boundary layer profiler, visibility and
              cloud bases to 7.5 km with a laser ceilimeter, and virtual temperature to about
              1 km using a radio acoustic sounding system.  The radiometer will greatly
              extend the vertical range of MIPS by providing profiles of temperature,
              humidity, and cloud water to about 10 km.   Applications planned for the
              augmented system are (1) studies of the time-varying temperature and humidity
              profiles in the atmospheric boundary layer; (2) investigations of convective
              initiation in relation to boundary layer structure; (3) relating temperature
              and humidity profiles to the evolution of thunderstorms; (4) measuring
              temperature and humidity profiles in landfalling hurricanes; (5) using the
              system in various multi-agency field programs.  The data will be made available
              in real time to the local office of the National Weather Service to assess the
              contribution the observations can make to weather forecasting.
