Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT - BOEHMAN

An AVL Engine Videoscope is acquired and implemented on
              two research engines being used for study of atomization, ignition, and
              combustion behavior of alternative diesel fuels.  This apparatus enables
              observation of the spray behavior of fuel blends, the impact of oxygenated
              fuels on the ignition and combustion behavior of diesel fuel, and the ignition
              of natural gas by a pilot injection of oxygenated fuel.  The emphasis of the
              studies is on emissions characterization and combustion analysis by means of
              in-cylinder sensing.
