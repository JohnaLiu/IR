Abstract    :
              This grant provides support for the FutureTruck Challenge.  This competition is
              jointly sponsored by the NSF, the Department of Energy and the automotive
              industry in support of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV)
              program.  It has the goal of designing and competing commercially producible
              vehicles in the range of sport utility vehicles to trucks that are
              simultaneously comfortable, safe, roadable, commercially viable, and highly
              fuel efficient.  Under this competition, a number of universities compete
              annually in this event.  The award provides funding to support the competition
              and to offset costs for expenses such as team prizes, communication and safety
              equipment rentals and other competition expenses.
