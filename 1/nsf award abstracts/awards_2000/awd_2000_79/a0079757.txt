Abstract

The necessary supercomputing resources to
              study several grand challenge problems in astrophysics and planetary science
              will be developed at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The
              supercomputing capability will be available to all department faculty and
              students. The student body has 50% women.  There is great potential for a broad
              public impact on fundamental physics issues, especially in collaboration with
              the Visualization lab.  Research activities enabled by this new capability
              include simulations of planetary convection's and magnetic fields, planetary
              collisional modeling with smooth particle hydrodynamics, galaxy formation and
              large-scale structure of the Universe, and modeling of supernova and gamma ray
              bursts.
