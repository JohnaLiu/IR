Abstract    :
              A superconducting solenoidal spectrometer and state-of-the-art detectors 
for
              low energy electrons will be used for a series of high precision
measurements
              of neutron beta-decay using, for the first time, 
Ultra-Cold Neutrons (UCN).
              In particular the angular correlation (A) 
between the neutron spin direction
              and the electron momentum will be 
measured with a statistical precision of <
              0.2% and substantially 
smaller systematic errors. This represents nearly a
              factor of five 
improvement over the present best measurements in an
              experiment with 
significantly different and considerably smaller systematic
              uncertainties. 

High-precision measurements of the A-correlation in neutron
              beta-decay 
can be combined with measurements of the neutron and muon
              lifetimes to
extract the u-quark/d-quark weak mixing also known as V_ud - 
a
              key component of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix.
              Improved
measurements of V_ud can provide access to physics beyond the
              
Standard Model by testing the unitarity of this matrix.
