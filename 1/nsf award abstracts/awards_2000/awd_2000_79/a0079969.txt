This is a five-year effort that engages engineering students at
              Michigan Technological University in the design and development of assistive
              and/or rehabilitative devices for persons with disabilities. The objective is
              the completion of four design projects annually, which will assist individual
              disabled persons served by the Copper Country Intermediate School District
              (CCISD). Each design project will be assigned to a team consisting of three to
              five senior students in biomedical engineering, mechanical engineering, and
              electrical engineering. Students in other disciplines may participate,
              depending on skills required for a given project. Local high school students
              will be engaged in fabrication of some of the projects, through a partnership
              with Hancock (MI) High School's industrial arts program. Each project will be
              advised by a faculty member -- either one of investigators, or another member
              of the engineering faculty who has appropriate expertise and interest.

All
              students who participate in one of these projects will complete a workshop on
              professional ethics and standards, prior to beginning a project. This workshop
              will inform the students of applicable standards and issues in patient
              confidentiality, liability, and intellectual property rights. This workshop
              will be conducted jointly by members of the professional staff of CCISD and the
              investigators.

The principal investigator will, by July I of each year,
              provide the National Science Foundation with a report describing the projects
              completed.
