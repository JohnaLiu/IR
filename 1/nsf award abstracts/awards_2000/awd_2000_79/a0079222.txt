Abstract    :
              	This project supports laboratory studies of the reaction of the nitrate radical
              (NO3) with salt (NaCl) particles. The objective of this work is to study
              possible nighttime mechanisms of chlorine (Cl2) production. Field studies have
              established that Cl2 (and perhaps other photochemically labile chlorine
              containing inorganics such as HOCl) are generated at night in coastal marine
              areas, however, none of the known processes can explain this phenomenon. 
              
	Particles will be introduced into an aerosol chamber under conditions of
              temperature, pressure, and relative humidity relevant to the marine boundary
              layer. NO3 will be generated in situ, and the reactants and products monitored
              by FTIR and UV/VIS spectrometry and atmospheric pressure ionization
              spectrometry (APIMS). Experimental results will be interpreted using a
              computational kinetics model that includes gas and liquid diffusion, mass
              accommodation and chemistry in real time in both the gas and liquid phases, and
              where appropriate, the interface.
