Title:  Workshop Support:  DIALM for Mobility


This award
              supports the 4th International Workshop on Discrete Algorithms and Methods for
              Mobile Computing and Communications (DIAL M for Mobility).  This workshop is
              devoted for discrete algorithms and methods in the context of mobile and
              wireless computing and communications.  The workshop is intended to serve as a
              forum for open discussions and lively debate, and to foster cooperation among
              practitioners and theoreticians.
