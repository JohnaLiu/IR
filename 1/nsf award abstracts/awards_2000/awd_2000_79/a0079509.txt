Abstract    :
              This proposal requests funds to upgrade the existing Princeton Subpicosecond
              Laser Facility by replacing the current KrF amplifiers with a 600 mJ, 10 Hz
              repetition rate, multipass Ti/Sapphire amplifier.  The funds requested are for
              direct purchase of the system from a commercial company.  The first objective
              of the upgraded system is to further exploit ideas for the development of a
              compact soft x-ray laser in the "water window" region of the spectrum that is
              potentially so valuable for biological applications.  At the same time, the
              facility would serve as a resource for faculty members and graduate students
              from different departments in multi-disciplinary projects, including Raman
              amplification of subpicosecond pulses, study of surface modification of solid
              materials, and the study of property changes in thin layers of semiconductor
              materials.
