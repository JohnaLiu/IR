Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, a
              consortium of universities consisting of Florida State University, Florida A&M
              University and the University of Florida will acquire an Electron Paramagnetic
              Resonance (EPR) Spectrometer.  The new instrument will support the research of
              major users in the Chemistry, Oceanography and Geology Departments at the
              various institutions.  Among the research programs in which EPR spectroscopy
              will play a vital role are: a) muscle biophysics; b) photosynthesis; c)
              metalloproteins; d) the structure and role in chemical reactions of reactive
              species such as radicals, radical-ion pairs, carbenes and nitrenes; e) use of
              EPR to study mineral dating and thermal stability; and f) spin distribution
              along the chains of low dimensional cuprate polymers.

An electron
              paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer is an instrument used to obtain
              information about the molecular and electronic structure of molecules. It may
              also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals which
              are often essential for the initiation of tumor growth and/or a variety of
              chemical reactions.  These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, in
              particular biological chemistry, materials sciences and geology.
