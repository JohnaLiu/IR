This award provides 62% partial funding support for the
              acquisition of an X-ray microdiffractometer system to be installed and operated
              in the Department of Earth Science at Florida International University. The
              Florida International University is committed to providing the remaining funds
              necessary to acquire and install the system. The instrument system will be used
              for research and training of students in the fields of experimental geophysics,
              mineral physics, and materials science. Analytical applications will include
              characterization of the states of matter of samples subjected to extreme
              conditions of temperature and pressure mimicking ambient conditions deep in the
              Earth.
