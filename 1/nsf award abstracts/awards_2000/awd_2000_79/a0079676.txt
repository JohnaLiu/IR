Abstract    :
              The NanoScience and Technology Center of the University of Notre Dame
              is
creating a NanoScience Measurements Laboratory to provide
              state-of-the-art
instrumentation for the characterization of the electronic
              properties of
nanoelectronic, nanomechanical, molecular, and superconducting
              materials
and devices, as well as state-of-the art semiconductor devices
              and
circuits. This major research instrumentation grant will be located in
              the
College of Engineering and support research and teaching across
              the
university including the departments of Electrical Engineering,
              Chemical
Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering, Chemistry and
              Biochemistry,
and Physics.

The instrumentation purchased will provide
              precision current-voltage and
impedance measurements from dc to 110 MHz, 300
              mW to 500 MW, with
triaxially-guarded cabling and low current and voltage
              resolution (10 fA
and 2 mV). Ease of use and rapid sample exchange will be
              enabled by use of
a Cascade thermal probe station which handles samples from
              centimeter-sized
pieces to 8-inch wafers and with a temperature-controlled
              chuck (- 65 to
200 C). A computer provides for data acquisition, instrument
              control, and
storage. This system will benefit users across the University of
              Notre Dame
including undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty. External
              use and
collaborations will be encouraged.
