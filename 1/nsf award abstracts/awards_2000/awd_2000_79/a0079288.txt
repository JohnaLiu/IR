Abstract    :
              The focus of this research is the development of the aza-variant of the
              oxa-di-pi-methane  photochemical rearrangement as a new synthetic method for
              the preparation of nitrogen heterocycles.  The rearrangement of
              azabicyclo[2.2.2]-octenones and azabicyclo[3.2.2]-nonenones is expected to
              provide tricyclic products in which the 3-member ring can be cleaved
              stereoselectively to give pyrrolizidines, indolizidines or tropanes.  New
              methodologies based on the Diels-Alder reaction are being developed to
              synthesize the requisite photoprecursors and the attachment of photoprecursors
              and photosensitizers to resins will be explored as a means for ready isolation
              and functionalization of photoproducts. 

With this award, the Organic and
              Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Cynthia K.
              McClure of the Department of Chemistry at Montana State University.  Professor
              McClure will focus her work on developing photochemical methods for the
              production of nitrogen heterocycles.  The synthetic targets are compounds with
              interesting biological properties and the work should have broader impact in
              the pharmaceutical industry.  The research provides an excellent training
              ground for the education of undergraduate and graduate students.
