              Abstract

The Department of Mathematics at the University  of South Carolina
              will
purchase computing and visualization equipment which will be
dedicated
              to the support of four research projects in the mathematical
sciences. The
              equipment will support ongoing research in:
(1) Nonlinear approximation in
              multiresolution analysis with
applications to digital terrain maps and medical
              imaging,
(2) Domain decomposition and multigrid methods for partial
              differential
equations, (3) Eulerian-Lagrangian localized adjoint methods for
              advection-
diffusion equations, and (4) Computational number theory. The
              integration
of serial, parallel, and visualization equipment, complete with
              requisite
software, will provide the necessary  computing environment for
              the
investigators to perform the educational and research missions of
              these
projects
