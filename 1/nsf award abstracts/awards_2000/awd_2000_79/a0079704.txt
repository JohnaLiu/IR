Abstract    :
              The primary objective of the VERITAS collaboration's research effort is to find 
              celestial point sources of ultra high energy gamma rays. Over the past decade
              the collaboration has pioneered the development of the Atmospheric Cherenkov
              Imaging Technique. Currently the collaboration operates a 10m  imaging
              telescope situated on Mount Hopkins in South East Arizona. The collaboration
              has successfully detected ultra high energy gamma rays from the Crab Nebula and
              the active galactic nuclei Markarian 421, Markarian 501 and 1ES_2344. The
              observational program is aimed at looking for gamma rays from a variety of
              celestial objects such as supernova remnants, pulsars, binary x-ray sources,
              black holes and active galactic nuclei. A rich education/outreach component of
              this project is under development in conjunction with the Smithsonian
              Institution and the Adler Planetarium in Chicago.
