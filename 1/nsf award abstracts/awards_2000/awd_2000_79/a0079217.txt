Abstract    :
              

Acquisition of a state-of-the-art, single-wafer cluster tool
              for
silicon-based heteroepitaxy is proposed.  The equipment is an
              Applied
Materials 'Epi Centura High Temperature' platform, configured with
              an
epitaxial growth chamber capable of slip-free processing of wafers in
              the
temperature range of 550 to 1200C. The Applied Epi Centura tool
              enables
chemical vapor deposition of blanket and selective epitaxial Si and
              Si1-xGex
with excellent layer thickness uniformity across the wafer.  The
              gas
manifold will be customized to allow a wide range of sources to be
              used,
enabling research on new materials of rapidly increasing interest such
              as
Si1-yCy and SiGeC.  The proposed instrument will have unique
              capabilities
and will enable collaborations among researchers from industry
              and universities.

There is a significant and growing importance of
              silicon-based heteroepitaxy
in basic and applied device research, particularly
              as researchers work
towards some of the fundamental barriers to continued
              transistor scaling and
performance improvements.  Research on the fabrication
              of new semiconductors
and structures, and the development of novel device
              concepts is required to
overcome these limits and this will be permitted by
              this tool.
Additionally, the ability to synthesize new silicon-compatible
              materials in
this tool opens up new areas of research on photonic
              and
microelectromechanical systems.  The proposed tool will be operated as
              a
central facility within the Microsystems Technology Laboratory (MTL). 
              The
lab has over 300 users per year, and the tool will be accessible to
              this
community
