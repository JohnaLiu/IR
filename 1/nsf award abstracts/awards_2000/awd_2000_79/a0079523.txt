Abstract

An upgrade of the infrared detector for the Ohio
              State University-NOAO infrared imaging spectrometer (ONIS) at the 2.4-meter
              telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory will be implemented.  This has been
              a very productive instrument for astronomical research. The MDM Consortium, Inc
              operates the telescope, which is a consortium of Dartmouth College (1/3) and
              Ohio State University, Columbia University and the University of Michigan.  In
              addition to doubling the field of view and wavelength coverage of the
              instrument, this upgrade eliminates serious cosmetic effect errors in the
              current system that causes calibration errors. The current detector will be
              replaced by an improved 1024x1024 pixel large format Raytheon InSb focal plane
              for use in the 1 to 3 micrometer wavelength region. 

The scientific research
              areas planned are wide-field surveys for extremely red objects (ERO's),
              infrared studies of globular cluster ages and infrared studies of supernovae.
