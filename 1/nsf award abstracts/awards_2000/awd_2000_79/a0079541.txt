Abstract


A versatile instrument (PRISM) for the Perkins
              72-inch telescope located on Anderson Mesa south of Flagstaff and operated by
              Lowell Observatory in Collaboration with Boston University will be developed.  
              The telescope currently has no instruments since Ohio State has pulled out of
              the consortium which "owns" this telescope. This prism instrument will provide
              for wide-field imaging, polarimetry and low dispersion multi-object
              spectroscopy.
The system will employ a large format (2048x2048), 15-micron
              pixel Loral CCD focal plane.  Wide-field imaging on this 1.83-meter telescope
              will cover a 13.6 x 13.6 arcminutes field of view with 0.4 arcsecond pixels
              across the entire 0.32 to 1. Micron wavelength range.  The moderate resolution
              grism spectrometer will cover the same spectral range with a spectral resolving
              power of approximately 1,000. Linear imaging polarimetry will cover 90 square
              arc-minute field of view with incremental polarization below 0.05%, across the
              0.32 to 1-micrometer wavelength band.
