	This award provides 54% partial funding support for the
              acquisition and installation of a multi-collector inductively coupled mass
              spectrometer system for the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The Woods
              Hole Oceanographic Institution is committed to providing the remaining funds
              necessary to acquire and install the system. The instrument system will be used
              for research and training of students in the fields of earth sciences and
              oceanography. Analytical applications will include high precision measurements
              of isotope ratios of geochemically significant elements such as Th, Pb, Mo, Hf,
              O, Sr, and Nd.
