Abstract    :
              This award to Drs. David Walba and Joseph Maclennan of the University of
              Colorado at Boulder is jointly supported by the Advanced Materials and
              Processing Program in the Chemistry Division and the Solid State Chemistry
              Program in the Division of Materials Research. The focus of the award will be
              to study and develop the basic mechanisms of optically bistable and
              photo-switchable molecular schemes in self-assembled monolayers for
              ferroelectric liquid crystal alignments. Synthesis of self-assembled monolayers
              of azo-dye units oriented parallel to the substrates that can be aligned using
              linearly polarized UV radiation will be studied under this award.
              Photo-activated homogeneous alignment of liquid crystal - photo buffing - in
              place of traditional mechanical buffing or rubbing will also be carried out
              under this award.  Teaching and training of students in materials science are
              parts of the award. 

Under this award, self-assembled monolayers will be
              designed and developed from photoisomerizable azo groups and attached to
              bookshelf structures of ferroelectric liquid crystals.  Photo-activated
              alignments of liquid crystals planned under this award will eliminate the
              traditional mechanical rubbing in the manufacturing process of active matric
              liquid crystal devices.  In addition, this process if technologically exploited
              will result in reduced manufacturing costs, enhanced contrast and depth of
              images, and improved yield and quality control of the display devices. In
              addition, the research program will provide a rich multidisciplinary education
              and training opportunity in materials chemistry to postdoctoral and graduate
              students
