Abstract    :
              With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa will acquire
              a High Field (W-Band) Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectrometer. 
              Among the research programs in which EPR spectroscopy will play a vital role
              are: a) the study of carotenoids as radical scavengers; b) the mechanism of
              formation of mesoporous silicas; c) use of molecular genetics and high-field
              EPR to identify and characterize the binding site of the phylloquinone cofactor
              in Photosystem I; d) ferromagnetic resonance studies of high-anisotropy
              magnetic media; e) studies of biologically-relevant first row transition metal
              assemblies; and f) EPR spectroscopy of localized radical cations within
              redox-gradient dendrimers.

An electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
              spectrometer is an instrument used to obtain information about the molecular
              and electronic structure of molecules. It may also be used to obtain
              information about the lifetimes of free radicals which are often essential for
              the initiation of tumor growth and/or a variety of chemical reactions.  These
              studies will have an impact in a number of areas, especially materials science
              and biochemistry.
