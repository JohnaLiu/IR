The effects of subduction-zone metamorphism on the chemical
              and isotopic compositions of oceanic crust and sediments subducted into the
              mantle have not been adequately considered in models of ocean-atmosphere-mantle
              geochemical cycling.  In the research funded by this grant, the P.I. and his
              students will evaluate the nature of these effects through combined field and
              geochemical study of fluid loss and chemical alteration in metamorphic rocks in
              the Italian Alps thought to have been subducted to 50-120 km depths.  The two
              specific field localities include a well-studied traverse of variably
              metamorphosed shales and carbonate rocks exposed in the Cottian Alps, and
              exposures of metamorphosed oceanic crustal rocks (and their overlying sediment
              cover) in the Valtournenche area.  These localities are well-suited because of
              their particularly well-preserved metamorphic mineral assemblages and chemical
              compositions representing the effects of deep subduction.   In addition, the
              lithologies at the two localities are representative of those thought to
              contribute geochemically to the production of arc lavas, and the carbonate-rich
              metasedimentary sections will afford insight into the decarbonation history of
              similar sections in modern subduction zones such as the Central America and
              Banda arc-trench systems.  This planned study of devolatilization based on
              subduction-zone metamorphic suites will contribute to our knowledge of the
              cycling of volatiles such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen between Earth's
              oceans/atmosphere and mantle (information important in models of long- and
              short-term atmosphere evolution).
