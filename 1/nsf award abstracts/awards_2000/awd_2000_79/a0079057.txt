Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Division will support a three day workshop, to be held at Arizona
              State University, to update and revise the manual "Teaching Chemistry to
              Students with Disabilities."  The American Chemical Society will publish the
              revised manual and it will be distributed by the ACS and the American
              Association for the Advancement of Science. 

The revised manual will consist
              of an overview of current and best practices for participation of k-12,
              undergraduate and graduate students with visual, hearing, motor and learning
              disabilities in instructional programs in chemistry. The manual will cover
              safety, laboratory modifications, lecture and testing strategies, use of
              computers in instruction, instructional materials and rules and regulations
              such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. 

Workshop participants will be
              drawn from those with established reputations in teaching chemistry to students
              with disabilities at the k-12 through university levels as well as graduate and
              undergraduate students.
