Abstract    :
              The IEA International Coordinating Center (ICC) at SRI proposes to work with
              OECD staff, U.S. researchers, and researchers in other interested countries to
              create an implementation plan that coordinates and, to the extent appropriate,
              combines, the national-level implementation of the complementary IEA and OECD
              studies.  This process will include coordinating research goals and
              methodologies, merging instruments, coordinating schedules, and providing
              technical support and quality assurance so that the studies can be done
              together in those countries (including the United States) that choose to do so.
               This is a significant, novel, and time-sensitive effort that will increase the
              payoff and efficiencies of both studies and lay a foundation for future
              organizational collaboration.
