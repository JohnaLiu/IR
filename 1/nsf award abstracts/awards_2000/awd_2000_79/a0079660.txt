Abstract    :
              The MARGINS program seeks to understand the complex interplay of processes that
              govern continental margin evolution globally, particularly targeting
              multidisciplinary research programs involving field experiments, numerical
              simulations, and laboratory analyses.    Support is provided to continue the
              MARGINS coordinating office, which will be transferred from the University of
              Hawaii to the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory.   The coordinating office will
              help focus and implement efforts of investigators on specific initiatives and
              geographic areas identified in the MARGINS Program Science Plan, help
              disseminate information on program activities and results to a large and
              diverse community, and coordinate MARGINS activities with other appropriate
              national and international activities.
