Abstract    :
              Alvin L. Crumbliss of Duke University is supported by the Inorganic,
              Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for research on mechanisms
              of ligand-metal exchange reactions-- with emphasis on second sphere-influences.
              He is PI of NSF grant 9709105 ($345K for 36 months) in this same area, and
              earlier grants extending to 1976. Aims of the present grant include elucidation
              of:  kinetics and mechanisms of dissociation of Fe(III) from chelate complexes,
              aspects of host-guest chemistry in the second sphere, Fe(III-II) redox
              potentials of complexes and second-sphere aggregates, and second-sphere effects
              on mobility of Fe(III) in various environments.

Metal ions are centrally
              involved in important changes that figure in all areas of science, including
              geology, biology, medicine and ecology. Ferric iron -- Fe(III) -- is one of the
              most common, versatile, and important metal ions. Since it tends to be rather
              sluggish in regard to replacing atoms in its near neighborhood ("first
              coordination sphere") there are many advantages in selecting that ion for
              detailed study.  Results of this group and others have shown that atoms beyond
              the first coordination sphere ("second coordination sphere") influence,
              modulate, and control what goes on near the metal ion, and thereby have
              dramatic effect on the overall chemistry that can be observed in macroscopic
              systems (geology, biology, ecology). This program is making good progress in
              unrraveling the subtle factors that govern this important class of chemistry.
