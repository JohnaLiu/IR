This Major Research Instrumentation award to Coastal Carolina
              University provides instrumentation for marine and environmental sciences
              research and training. In particular, support will provide graphite furnace and
              flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer and carbon-nitrogen-sulfur analysis
              instruments and computers for developing a laboratory intranet,as well as
              additional instrumentation to expand the laboratory capabilities in
              environmental chemistry.  The project is supported by the Division of Ocean
              Sciences at NSF. Coastal Carolina University will provide cost-share support
              for nearlhy 40% of total project costs.
