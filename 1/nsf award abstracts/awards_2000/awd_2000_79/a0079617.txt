MRI:  A Memory
              Intensive Compilation Environment Targeting VLIW and DSP Architectures

This
              proposal is to acquire Linux/Unix TRU64 and Linux/X86 compute servers to enable
              the support of memory intensive compiler research at the Electrical and
              Computer Engineering Department of Northeastern University.  The research
              projects that will use the requested compute servers include
              Optimization-centered code restructuring and scheduling, memory coloring and
              compaction targeting DSPs, and dynamic profiling, compilation and evaluation
              environments.
