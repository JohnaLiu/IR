Abstract    :
              This project, sponsored by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,
              continues research into the determination of structure and reactivity at
              polymer surfaces and interfaces. The research, conducted by Dr. Joseph A.
              Gardella and his students at SUNY-Buffalo, uses  X-ray photoelectron
              spectroscopy (XPS), time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS),
              and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) to study well
              characterized macromolecular systems. The systems include mono-and multi- layer
              thin films, copolymer systems from narrow molecular weight distribution
              prepolymers and degradable polymers with controllable crystallinity. The
              project elucidates the effects of chain length, segment distribution, spatial
              distribution of smaller molecular weight polymer chains, and segregation of
              multicomponent polymer mixtures on surface properties such as adhesion,
              friction , and degradability. 

The information generated by this project
              will be extremely important in the design and development of new materials for
              use as  semiconductor adhesives, general use adhesives, lubricants and low
              friction coatings, biomaterials, and non-toxic coatings for evironmental use.
