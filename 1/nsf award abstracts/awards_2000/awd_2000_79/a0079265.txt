Abstract    :
                   This award supports the use of crucial genetic technology for research
              projects in several important areas of ecological and evolutionary research. 
              One project will study the costs and benefits of social cooperation, a second
              will facilitate the inventory and abundance estimates for North American
              carnivores, and a third will study the importance of selection at genes
              scattered throughout the genome in salmonid fish.  Each of these projects
              addresses fundamental issues in ecology or evolution.
 
     The equipment
              purchased is a Li-COR Gene imaging system with additional gene imaging software
              (LI-COR 4200-2NEN Global IR2).  This system will allow researchers at the
              University of Montana to carry out critical gene sequencing activities and also
              to determine the genetic profile of individuals with a high degree of
              resolution.  

     The broad implications of this award include the
              strengthening of research infrastructure at the University of Montana.  In
              addition, the presence of this infrastructure will allow training of
              undergraduate and graduate students in some of the latest genetic techniques as
              they apply to ecology and evolutionary research.  One of the research projects
              will involve studies of an endangered species, the Canadian Lynx.
