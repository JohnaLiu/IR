The overall goal of this Major Research Instrumentation project
              is the development of a state-of-the-art, large scale, physical groundwater
              flow and transport modeling facility to be used in a variety of research and
              education training capacities.  As a modern research facility, it will be used
              to:  1) investigate the applicability of computer-aided analysis and design
              tools to the solution of groundwater contamination problems; 2) study and
              evaluate fundamental scientific hypotheses regarding mass transport of
              contaminants in layered porous media; and 3) examine and assess remediation
              concepts for nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) in heterogeneous (layered)
              environments.  As an education and training facility, it will be an integral
              part of graduate and undergraduate teaching curriculum in civil and
              environmental engineering, geology and environmental sciences at the University
              of Vermont (UVM) and offers students a unique learning and research
              opportunity.
