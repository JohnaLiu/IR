Abstract    :
              Dr. Raymond will use a highly simplified two column model to better understand
              large-scale tropical circulations and to help test cumulus parameterizations
              for atmospheric global circulation models.  The model involves the use of two
              embedded cumulus ensembles, one in each column, that are coupled by mass flows
              which tend to drive the two column's environments toward buoyancy equilibrium
              with each other.  These mass flows are the two column analog of large scale
              tropical circulations where one column represents the ascending (moist,
              convective) branch of the Walker circulation and the other column is the
              descending (clear, driven by radiative cooling) branch.  The convective
              ensemble calculations thus operate in a context that is close to that which
              actually occurs in the equatorial regions of the earth's atmosphere.  Vertical
              velocities in the two columns are created by the model itself rather than being
              imposed.  The cumulus ensembles can be replaced by candidate cumulus
              parameterizations for purposes of comparison with ensemble model calculations.
