The PI's propose
              work evaluating how external and in situ factors affect ecosystem function,
              community dynamics, and species diversity on islands in the Gulf of California.
               There are five primary goals.  First, to understand how multiple factors
              influence the distribution and abundance of populations.  Second, to understand
              how spatial (landscape) factors and temporal variability in productivity affect
              community dynamics and ecosystem function.  Third, to connect processes and
              productivity in the ocean to population and food web dynamics on land.  Fourth,
              to analyze the long-term dynamics of focal species.  Fifth, to address factors
              that affect the stability of populations, communities, and ecosystems.  A
              combination of experiments and field sampling will be conducted over a 4 year
              period to test specific hypotheses related to each goal.
