Abstract    :
              


We recently proposed and demonstrated novel Strain Energy Band Engineering
              (SEBE) in AlInGaN-based quantum wells and multiple quantum well structures.
              SEBE will allow us to independently control energy band offset and lattice
              mismatch (strain) in AlInGaN-based heterostructures.  This should allow us to
              develop a new generation of electronic and photonic devices, since we should be
              able to obtain a new family of heterostructures with controlled properties.  To
              achieve this goal, we must develop a high power nonlinear visible/UV
              spectroscopy system in order to study built-in electric fields, non-equilibrium
              hot carrier dynamics and optical gain in wide band gap semiconductors and
              heterostructures under strongly non-equilibrium conditions. 
This system will
              allow us to apply our experience with wide-band gap electronic and
              optoelectronic materials and devices to a new, and even more exciting area of
              photonic wide band gap materials and devices with possible application to
              solid-state lighting, which is 10 times more efficient than standard
              incandescent lighting.  We will take advantage of being the only group in the
              world that has access to bulk AlN, bulk GaN, and one of the best sources of
              epitaxial binary, ternary, and quaternary wide band gap films.  We need the
              system that allows us to obtain (i) subpicosecond time resolution, (ii) that is
              tunable in the range from 200 nm to 800 nm (to cover the AlN-GaN-InN materials
              system), (iii) operational in the temperature range from 4.2 K to 300K.
