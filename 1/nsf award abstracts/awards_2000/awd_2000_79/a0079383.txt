Abstract    :
              Toole/Robbins
This project is intended as a continuation of an attempt to
              synthesize a broad picture of the three-dimensional circulation of the Pacific
              using observations of deep hydrography and nutrients from the World Ocean
              Circulation Experiment (WOCE) together with data from subsurface floats.  The
              approach to be taken will divide the Pacific into approximately 70 boxes and
              use a linearly constrained inverse estimation technique to deduce a circulation
              that best fits the observations while conserving mass and tracer fluxes.
