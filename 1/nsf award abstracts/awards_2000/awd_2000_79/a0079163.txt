Abstract    :
              This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the
              traditional size limit of the Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) input aperture. 
              This limit (approximately 8-inches) is imposed by (1) practical fabrication
              limits to the size of glass flats that can be polished to a surface figure of
              lambda/100 and (2) by cost limitations.  Although an array of smaller glass
              plates might be used to expand the collecting area of the FPI, coordination of
              spectral scans over the array elements requires unwieldy control systems or
              else is not possible with conventional barometric or piezo-electric FRI
              systems.  This research establishes arrays of innovative FPI etalons that use
              liquid crystal (LC) in the FPI resonant cavity.  Spectral scanning of these
              devices is accomplished by application of a low current to conducting layers
              applied to the glass substrates.  The electric field imposed upon liquid
              crystal in the resonant cavity alters the orientation of the LC, and thus the
              index of refraction of the material in the resonant cavity.  The ease of
              electronic control over the refractive index in the FPI cavity permits simple,
              low weight, low power coordination of multiple LC filled cells and thus makes
              possible a large array of FPI cells, scanning a spectrum in unison.  Phase II
              will design and fabricate two 10-inch diameter arrays of LC FPI (LCFP) filters.
               One array will be configured for Doppler measurements of atmospheric emissions
              and the other for 0.16-nanometer spectral resolution.

Potential commercial
              applications are expected in (1) atmospheric lidar, (2) space-based
              environmental sensing, (3) passive airglow sensing, (4) clear-air turbulence
              detection, and (5) target detection.
