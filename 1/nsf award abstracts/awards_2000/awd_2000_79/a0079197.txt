This project will investigate Tzotzil Maya ethnoecological
              knowledge of macrofungi (mushrooms), an important dietary and medicinal element
              in this part of the world. Since Maya ethnomycological classification focuses
              almost exclusively on edible or useful species (in contrast to patterns for
              other plants and animals), mushroom species provide an opportunity for
              comparative analysis of the structure and function of general purpose and
              special purpose taxonomies, and how these affect behavior. The naming,
              classification, and use of mushrooms will be examined in order to understand
              how both environments and cultural contexts affect ethnobiological knowledge
              (cognitive variation in knowledge). Hypotheses concerning three competing
              models of folk biological classification will be tested. This study will also
              document the biodiversity and ecological requirements of mushrooms and
              contribute to our understanding of the ecological, dietary, medicinal and
              economic benefits of mushrooms.
