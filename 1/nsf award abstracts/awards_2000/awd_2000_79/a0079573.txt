	This award provides seventy-percent partial funding support
              for the acquisition of mass spectrometry instrumentation to be installed and
              operated in the Environmental Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory at the Michigan
              State University. The University is committed to providing the remaining funds
              necessary for the acquisition of the instruments. The mass spectrometers will
              be used in basic and applied research projects aimed at improved understanding
              of interactions between the biosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere. The
              instrumentation will also be employed in laboratory technique courses at
              Michigan State University.
