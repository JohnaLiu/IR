Abstract


This grant supports the
              purchase of a group of instruments that provide the capability of analysis and
              characterization of various types of microparticles and nanoparticles.  One
              instrument , a Quantachrome Autosorb 1-C, is a multipurpose device for
              determining surface areas and pore-size distributions as well as surface-site
              properties by gas adsorption/desorption methods.  A second, a ZetaPlus, can
              measure zeta potential on particles from colloidal size up to 30-microns
              diameter.  This device has a phase-analysis light-scattering option that
              increases the sensitivity of electrophoretic mobility measurements.  A third
              acquisition is an Aerosizer DSP dry powder size analyzer, with supersonic gas
              entrainment of particles combined with laser optics, which can measure
              particle-size distributions from 0.2 to 700 microns.  The last item in the
              ensemble is a TSI GEMMA-method size analyzer.  This device creates an aerosol
              of suspended particles, dries the droplets, and then measures mobility of the
              remaining particles in an electric field.  The lower limit on size measurement
              here corresponds to a protein molecule with molecular weight of
              6000.

Nanotechnology promises advances in many practical fields.  The
              researchers using these instruments for characterization of nanoparticles are
              exploring applications in high-temperature synthesis of new ceramic materials,
              gene therapy, controlled drug delivery, protein stabilization in powders,
              production and treatment of nanoparticulate materials, and biotechnology.  The
              availability of these highly sensitive measurement instruments increases the
              accuracy and precision of their observations and enhances the significance of
              their results.
