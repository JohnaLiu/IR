MRI: 
              Parallel Algorithm Development on an Upgraded Beowulf Cluster

It is proposed
              to update an existing 5 processor BEOWULF system to 32-workstations, each
              having two processors, for a total of 64 processors.  The upgrade is motivated
              by the needs of the radiative heat transfer group at Florida Tech for a more
              powerful computing capability, and the development of parallel numerical
              algorithms for various large scale numerical linear algebra problems which have
              been under investigation by the applied mathematics and computer science groups
              for more than 10 years.  Both research activities require the parallel
              capability and the large amount of RAM proposed on each node.
