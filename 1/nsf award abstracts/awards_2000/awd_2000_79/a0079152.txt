Abstract    :
              Patrick E. Hoggard of the University of Santa Clara is supported by the
              Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program for research on
              photoreversible systems.  Certain photosensitive systems exhibit the unusual
              property of switching between two grossly different states (one predominantly
              product, the other predominantly reactant) on slight perturbation.  This is
              interpreted as indicating that the forward and reverse reactions involve
              different mechanisms. This phenomenon will be studied in Ru(bpy)2Cl2 systems,
              and other systems with this property will be sought for.

Switching between
              two states of quite different properties is important in a number of
              technologically and scientifically important areas. The systems of interest in
              this proposal involve both photochemical activation and sensitivity to changes
              in adjustable parameters, such as the nature of the solvent. This research aims
              at  increased understanding of presently known model systems. That increase in 
              understanding may well lead to development of new and useful photochemical
              systems and devices, as well as to progress in theoretical  comprehension.
