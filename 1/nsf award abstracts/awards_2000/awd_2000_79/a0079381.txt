     This project establishes an
              interactive web-based laboratory situation permitting social psychological
              experiments in which Japanese and U.S. subjects interact directly with each
              other.  The design will be pre-tested with some new experiments using a
              well-known mixed-motive game, with participants from both countries.  This new
              setting will permit a variety of social psychological and network exchange
              experiments.  It will foster training of graduate students and collaboration
              between scholars in the two countries, and will facilitate investigations of
              cultural differences and generalizability of results from experiments. 
              Microsoft will provide some of the software, with NSF and two universities
              (Cornell and UCLA) supporting the data collection and some of the training.
