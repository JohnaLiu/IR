Dan Voiculescu will study operator algebras in
              connection with free probability. He will emphasize applications of free
              entropy to operator algebras as well as the problems in operator algebras and
              random matrix theory posed by the development and unification of approaches to
              free entropy. There are also connections to masterfields in certain models in
              physics. Dan Voiculescu also intends to study noncommutative generalizations of
              the difference - quotient and of the Hilbert transform, in connection with
              duality for a certain class of coalgebras arising in free probability.
 
Free
              probability theory is a highly noncommutative parallel to basic probability
              theory , modelling the asymptotic behavior of large random matrices as their
              size increases. One main focus will be on free entropy, the quantity which
              plays in this context the role of Shannon's information-theoretic entropy. 
              Applications are in mathematics to von Neumann algebras and to random matrices,
              as well as to some models in physics .
