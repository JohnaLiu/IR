This award, made through the Major Research
              Instrumentation (MRI) Program, provides partial support of the costs of
              acquiring a suite of near-surface geophysical and sampling equipment for
              research on the Quaternary sedimentology and stratigraphy of barrier island
              systems, glacial geomorphology, and geoarchaeology at Boston University. 
              Specifically, instrumentation to be acquired includes a ground penetrating
              radar system (GPR), a trailer mounted hydraulic drill core system and truck,
              and an electronic total survey system.  Acquisition of this equipment will
              facilitate planned and ongoing research on the sedimentation processes
              responsible for the development of Holocene barriers in Maine and
              Massachusetts, studies of Quaternary glacial facies in high latitude alpine
              environments in an effort to correlate any observed climate signals to other
              well studied and documented millennial-scale climate events recorded in ice
              cores and deep marine sediments, and studies of the Miocene landscape evolution
              of the Dry Valleys of Antarctica.
