Abstract    :
              The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is an
              NSF-funded
project to detect gravitational waves. The Center for Gravitation
              and Cosmology at University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee (UWM) is member of the
              LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), and participates actively in the LIGO-I
              development group. Current LSC research activities at UWM are related to the
              analysis of LIGO data. These activities include the development of methods to
              characterize and clean the raw data stream (removing instrumental and
              environmental anomalies), and testing of algorithms to search for gravitational
              waves from astrophysical sources.

This action provides funds for the
              construction of a Beowulf-computer system at UWM for LIGO-related data analysis
              and code development. The proposed system is a parallel computer composed of
              128 nodes (plus 5 spares) connected by high-speed networking. The system is
              available, through online network connections, to a broad group of scientists
              within the LSC, including experimentalists, theorists, and
              astrophysicists.

The system is designed for rapid-turnaround data
              exploration and code development work. A representative data set (days or weeks
              of data) is kept on disks of 10 Terabytes capacity where it can be rapidly
              accessed. The complete system provides an environment with sufficient aggregate
              CPU power (~ 200 Gflops) for algorithm and code developers to carry out
              extensive exploration and testing on LIGO data.
