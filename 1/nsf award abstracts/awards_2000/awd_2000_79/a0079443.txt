MRI:  Equipment for
              Remote Usage, Access and Learning at NNUN

This CISE/MRI proposal will
              research The National Nanofabrication Users Network (NNUN) which proposes the
              acquisition of equipment and software to enhance the ability of the network to
              communicate between sites with remote users, and to provide remote training and
              fabrication-specific information, while providing remote computer aided design
              (CAD) capabilities.   Specifically NNUN proposes acquisition of software and
              hardware for: (1) video conferencing between sites and external user
              institutions, (2) production of multimedia training and  (3) allowing users to
              develop the bulk CAD pattern files remotely before arriving on-site.
