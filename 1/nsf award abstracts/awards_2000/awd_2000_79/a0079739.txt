MRI:  Acquisition and Analysis of
              a Multidisciplinary Beowulf Cluster

It is proposed to design, acquire,
              build, and test a ``Beowulf cluster`` multiprocessor that will provide a high
              performance computing environment for multidisciplinary scientific research and
              research training at Calvin College. The objective is to determine what cluster
              design is best suited for research projects in multiple disciplines.  More
              precisely, it is proposed to spend three years studying the performance of
              three common cluster topologies on different kinds of research problems.  The
              aim of the study is to identify the cluster topologies that are best suited for
              particular kinds of problems, as well as identify what topology provides the
              best overall performance for multidisciplinary research machine.
