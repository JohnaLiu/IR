The objective of
              this project is to develop and implement a large scale Holographic Particle
              Image Velocimetry (HPIV) system for measuring complex turbulent flows. The data
              will be used for addressing fundamental turbulence modeling questions. The
              system will enable measurements of the instantaneous, three-dimensional
              velocity distribution over sample volumes of up to 25x25x25 cm^3, at an
              unprecedented resolution in scale, with arrays of 500x500x500, 3-D velocity
              vectors. Efficient and high speed processing tools will enable analysis of many
              holograms.

Two main avenues of turbulence research provide motivation: i)
              scaling dynamics and statistical geometry of velocity increments in high
              Reynolds number turbulent flows, and ii) relationships between large and small
              scales in turbulence and their implications for subgird-scale modeling for
              Large Eddy Simulations (LES). The 3-D data will enable the PI and his
              colleagues to address the anomalous scaling behavior of high order structure
              functions that significantly deviate from Kolmogorov's predictions; Turbulence
              modeling for LES must be based on understanding of the interactions among
              turbulent motions at various length-scales. Such understanding requires data
              consisting of well-resolved velocity fields that can be the filtered to obtain
              the subgrid scale stresses, filtered velocity and its gradients.

Development
              and improvements to this technology would eventually make it available to an
              entire community of researchers in a wide range of fields where transport
              phenomena are of  significance. Included are communities involved in
              fundamental and applied fluid mechanics, multiphase flows involving transport
              of bubbles, particles and droplets as well as environmental flows, such as
              sediment transport, atmospheric sciences (turbulence and particle transport)
              and oceanography flow, particles and plankton dynamics, etc.).
