Abstract    :
              The objectives of this research project are to develop a microeconomic theory
              that explains the prevalence of laws that restrict parental decisions regarding
              the education and labor supply of their children. The basic idea is that such
              laws enable parents to commit to a higher level of education for their
              children, because in the absence of such laws, poor parents may be too
              impatient for additional consumption. In the longer run, this theory may serve
              as a prototype for investigations concerning the -relation between economic
              inequality and growth, as well as a positive model of the adoption of coercive
              social policies such as compulsory full-time education.
The current stage of
              the project consists of developing anal testing a static model of child -labor
              restrictions, anal exploring some of the policy implications of the model,
              using household survey data from Africa, Asia and Latin America. This work will
              lead to the development of a proposal for a longer-term project to develop a
              dynamic equilibrium analysis of child labor on the basis of our findings from
              the research based on the static model.
