Abstract    :
              PROPOSAL SUMMARY
The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the Bowling
              Green State University will purchase a Sun Enterprice 450 Server which will be
              dedicated to the support of research in the mathematical sciences. The
              equipment will be used for four research projects, including in
              particular:

_ James H. Albert: Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods in
              Bayesian
Model Diagnostics and Model Comparisons
_ Tong Sun: Finite element
              methods for shells and general mixed finite
element code development
_ Gordon
              Wade: Inverse problems
_ Craig Zribel: Exact study of turbulent diffusion and
              pair dispersion in
homogeneous turbulence
