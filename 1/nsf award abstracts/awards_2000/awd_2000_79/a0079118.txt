Abstract    :
              This project will investigate the acquisition of cultural knowledge of social
              hierarchy by Samoan youth; in Samoan society, as elsewhere, kin and family
              groups are ranked relative to one another in a social status hierarchy
              (centered on chiefs). Studies suggest that acquisition of cultural knowledge
              occurs through participation in culturally specific activities. This project
              will test the hypothesis the differences in participation occur as a result of
              one's gender and/or family rank, and that these differences result in
              variability in the models acquired. Methods include a demographic survey,
              structured interviews, participant observation, and videotaping/observations.
              The study will contribute to theories of socialization by examining how
              variations in participation in cultural practices lead to variation in social
              learning; it will also contribute to our understanding of how cultural
              knowledge comes to be transmitted and socially distributed across a given
              population.
