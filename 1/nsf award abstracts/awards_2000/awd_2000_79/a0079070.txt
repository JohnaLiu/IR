Abstract    :
              	The project is a continuation of research on dynamic models (studying the
              strategic interaction of agents over time, and also studying how changes in the
              distribution of workers' skills over time might influence and be influenced by
              the distribution of wages associated with those skills); competitive models
              (studying the problem of designing selling procedures - auctions - that ensure
              that the good or goods being sold end up in the hands of the buyers who value
              them the most, and also studying the role of monetary policy in achieving a
              desirable equilibrium outcome); contracts and implementation (studying how the
              inability to make accurate forecasts affects the nature of optimal contracts
              between agents); and voting (examining which voting rules satisfy desirable
              properties such as anonymity, neutrality, transitivity, and Pareto efficiency
              on the widest possible class of domains of preferences).
