	This proposal is for development of a 100
              element electron beam array source for the production and control of volumetric
              air plasmas.  The development project will be undertaken in partnership with
              Sandia Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM.  The electron beam array source will
              permit the study of volume filling air plasmas and MHD processes at
              temperatures far below those required for thermally sustained plasmas and under
              conditions which otherwise lead to arcing instabilities in electric field
              driven plasmas. The research areas that will be supported by this MRI equipment
              include following: 
1)	The exploration of approaches to the modification of
              attachment and recombination mechanisms at temperatures below 2000K in order to
              minimize the power requirements for sustaining volume air plasmas.
2)	The
              study of the extraction of power from high speed, low temperature (<3000K) air
              by MHD processes through the use of electron beam sustained conductivity.
3)
              The development of new control strategies for MHD processes using the currents
              of the 100 electron beam elements to spatially distribute and temporally
              modulate the conductivity.
4) The study of rapidly reconfigurable plasma
              arrays for the reflection of electromagnetic radiation.
The device will 
              consist of 100 separately controllable electron beams arranged in a 7 cm by 7
              cm, 10 x 10 array.  The size of the array has been chosen to  fit into a 7
              Tesla magnet which will be use to guide the electrons and, with the addition of
              electrodes, will become the power extraction channel for the study of MHD
              processes.
