This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of
              California, San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography provides funds for
              acquisition of an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer for earth, ocean
              and environmental sciences research.  It will be used for a wide variety of
              projects, and will include both undergraduate and graduate student in research
              and training. It will be managed as a recharge facility, available to many
              researchers and students at UCSD and other regional universities.  The project
              is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF. Scripps Institution will
              provide cost-share support for 50% of total project costs.
