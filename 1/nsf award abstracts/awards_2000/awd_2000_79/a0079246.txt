This Major Research Instrumentation award to University of
              Minnesota Duluth's Large Lakes Observatory provides funds for acquisition of an
              inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer and a carbon, nitrogen, sulfer
              analyzer for environmental sciences research.  It will be used for a wide
              variety of biogeochemical research projects, many emphasizing Great Lakes
              studies, and both undergraduate and graduate student will use the
              instrumentation for classwork, research and training. It will be managed as a
              recharge facility, available to many researchers and students at UMD and other
              regional universities.  The project is supported by the Division of Ocean
              Sciences at NSF. University of Minnesota will provide cost-share support for
              40% of total project costs.
