This award will support the construction and operation
              of
experimental detection equipment to perform the most
              fundamental
prediction of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at low energy.  Since
              the quality of existing measurements is not commensurate with the
precision of
              the theoretical prediction, a modern measurement at the
1.5% accuracy level
              would fill this important experimental gap, and
would test the prediction of
              the so-called axial anomaly at the
level of the theoretical precision.  The
              experiment will measure the
decay width of the neutron pi meson via coherent
              photoproduction in
the Coulomb field of the nucleus, i.e., the Primakoff
              effect.  The
experiment has been approved to run at Jefferson Laboratory
              with
high priority.  The project involves approximately 14 senior
researchers
              from 12 institutions, seven postdoctoral fellows, and
eight graduate students,
              and represents an excellent educational
opportunity.
