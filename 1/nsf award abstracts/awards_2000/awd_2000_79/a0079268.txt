Abstract    :
              Professor Andrei Tokmakoff of MIT is supported by the Experimental Physical
              Chemistry program to perform experimental studies on  the ultrafast dynamics of
              proteins.  This fundamental study will probe the basis for the forces that
              govern protein folding.  The PI will use two-dimensional ultrafast  infrared
              spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy to measure the dynamics of the amide bands
              of peptides and proteins as functions of temperature, pH and solvent.  The
              method will probe vibrational couplings, energy dissipation, solvent-protein
              interactions and structural heterogeneity in a unique way. 

The process by
              which proteins attain their intended 3 dimensional structures from a very large
              number of possible structures is not well understood, and this is a major
              unsolved problem in biochemistry.  The proposed work is especially timely
              because of recent progress in computational methods for studying protein
              folding.   New experiments in this area are critically needed and the PI
              proposes novel laser based approaches in analogy to methods utilized in Nuclear
              Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy.
