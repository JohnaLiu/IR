Abstract    :
              
A workshop will be organized and held in Central America to integrate the land
              and marine geological and geophysical studies that are being carried out in the
              region as part of the MARGINS Program.  These studies are focused on both
              seismogenic zone and subduction factory objectives.  The need for such a
              workshop was established at a MARGINS meeting held on December 14, 1999 in San
              Francisco that was attended by approximately 100 people.  The workshop will
              include a range of international and Central American colleagues.
