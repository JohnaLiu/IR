Abstract    :
              The Chemistry Division will support Virginia Tech to conduct a one year teacher
              enhancement/curriculum development project for use with its mobile chemistry
              laboratory, a state and privately funded, fully instrumented, 24 station,
              tractor-trailer rig that will make 10 visits annually to each of 20 school
              districts in rural, mountainous Southwestern Virginia.

This project will
              prepare teachers in the target region to develop and implement an inquiry-based
              (i.e. laboratory based), modern chemistry program as a means of improving
              student performance, scientific literacy and appreciation of the role chemistry
              plays in society. Planning and execution of the project involves participation
              of teachers and administrators in the target schools as well as from Virginia
              Tech. Comments from individuals who have directed similar projects in other
              regions of the country have been obtained along with concurrent funding from
              the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation for equipping the MCL and from the
              Eisenhower Program for  preparatory training workshops.
