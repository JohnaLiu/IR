Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Colby College will upgrade a 400 MHz NMR
              Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a)
              the isolation and identification of natural products; b) synthesis and
              reactivity of carbenes; c) antitumor agent development; d) nucleic acid and
              peptide structure/function relationships; and e) organometallic synthesis.  
              

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool
              available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is
              used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of
              atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between
              molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is
              essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from
              these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas including drug
              development and biochemistry.
