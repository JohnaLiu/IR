NSF Program : 1189      MAJOR RESEARCH INSTRUMENTATION

Abstract    :
              A Helium gas hydrostatic pressure apparatus with electrical and optical
access
              and a Kulicke and Soffa wire bonder will be acquired to
              investigate
piezoelectric constants in III-nitrides. The bonder is needed to
              attach
metallic wires for electrical access to the semiconductor for
              conductance
measurements. This instrumentation will nicely complement our
              existing
effort funded by NSF, which deals specifically with the polarization
              issues
in nitrides. The effort will be supported by our strong in house
              nitride
growth effort with MBE and MOCVD. Prof. Nathan of the University
              of
Minnesota, with whom we will collaborate, has already conducted these
              sorts
of experiments in nitrides. Initial experiments of resistivity vs.
              stress
on un-gated Hall bars have already been conducted. The resistivity
              exhibits
slow long term drifts (time constants of order 100 to 1000 seconds.
              Similar
effects observed earlier in GaAs have been ascribed to a defect
              center
associated with shallow donors called the DX center. However, the
              effect in
GaN is more complex, but it is reminiscent of the type of
              persistent
photoconductivity observed in GaAs in the early stages of
              development.
Clearly trapping effects will have to be separated from the
              piezoelectric
effects.  Such a study is crucial to the practical application
              electronic
nitride devices.
