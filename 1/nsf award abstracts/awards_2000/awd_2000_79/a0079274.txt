Abstract    :
              This project compares the ongoing Information Technology (IT) revolution with
              the Electricity Revolution (1885 - 1930).   It focuses on the stock market, and
              on the role that the small firm played. Along with the CRSP panel,
              investigators have collected data on individual firms in the NYSE going back to
              1885. Using these and other data from the curbmarket and other exchanges, the
              study asks if the stock market valuation of incumbent firms and the intensity
              of takeover activity during electrification behaved as they have so far in the
              IT era, and if we can expect a repeat of the 1929 stock market
              crash.

Preliminary results suggest some key differences between electricity
              and the computer:
1)  Computer use is spreading faster than electricity did.
              This may have been because the heavy industrial nature of early applications of
              electricity delayed the entry of new and smaller firms.
2)  The decline and
              poor performance of incumbents associated with electrification lasted longer
              than in the case of IT.
3)  The merger wave of 1899-1900 was less effective as
              a policing device than
the hostile takeover wave of the early 1980's.
These
              three differences probably arise because the capital market is now more
              efficient than it used to be, and because it makes the entry of small firms
              easier. And, these differences may be precisely why the current  IT  driven
              rise in the stock market may be sustainable, while the rise of the late 1920's
              was not. Finally, IT probably has a stronger skill-bias than factory
              electrification did. But as skilled workers were scarce in those days, the
              skill premium was as high in the early part of the twentieth century as it is
              today.
