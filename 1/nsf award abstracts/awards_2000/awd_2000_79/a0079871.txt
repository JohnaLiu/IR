MRI: 
              Development of the Distributed Teravoxel Data System:  Acquisition, Networking,
              Archiving, Analysis, and Visualization

This project addresses the problem of
              handling very large datasets through the development of generic acquisition and
              processing capabilities to be hosted at Caltech and made available to both
              Caltech and outside collaborators. Driven by investigations of flow turbulence,
              the project is designed to handle both laboratory and numerical-simulation
              data.  The infrastructure will support analysis and visualization of terascale
              experiment or simulation datasets and their comparison to validate theories and
              simulation results.
