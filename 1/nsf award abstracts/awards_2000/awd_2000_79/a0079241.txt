Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at the State University of New York in Cortland will
              acquire a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to
              carry out studies on a) sodium ion exchange from DNA in the presence of cation
              ligands; b) rhenium diimine tricarbonyl anion compounds and supramolecular
              assemblies; c) stereoselective synthesis of tropanes and other heterocyclic
              amine alkaloids; and d) the stereoselectivity of the 2+2 photodimerization of
              orotic acid, with implications on the primary mode of solar radiation induced
              DNA damage carcinogenesis and mutagenesis at the molecular level.  In addition,
              the NMR instrument will be used for coursework in organic chemistry and in the
              advanced laboratory component of the Chemistry program.   

Nuclear Magnetic
              Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists
              for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify
              unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within
              molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in
              solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists
              who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will
              have an impact in a number of areas including biochemistry and materials
              chemistry.
