MRI:  Acquisition of a
              Computational Mini-Grid Supercomputing Facility

The objective of this
              CISE/MRI proposal is to acquire computational equipment to support research in
              genomics, polymeric fibers and films, and high-performance computing systems. 
              This enabling technology will be used to support programs in the Clemson
              University Genomics Institute, the Center for Advanced Engineering Fibers and
              Films, and the Parallel Architecture Research Laboratory. The requested
              equipment will help these three groups meet their current goals, increase their
              computational capacity, and permit expansion into new research areas. It will
              foster collaboration, interdisciplinary work, and integration of research and
              education.
