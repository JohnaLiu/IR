This Major Research Instrumentation award to San Diego State
              University provides funds for acquisition of a multi-collector inductively
              coupled plasma-mass spectrometer for earth, ocean and environmental sciences
              research.  It will be used for a wide variety of projects, including mantle
              geochemistry, U-Pb geochemistry, bio-geochemistry, and research into laser
              wave-mixing techniques, and it will include both undergraduate and graduate
              students in research and training. It will be managed as a recharge facility,
              available to many researchers and students at SDSU, other California State
              University campuses, and to collaborators at UCSD and elsewhere.  The project
              was reviewed and supported collaboratively by the Divisions of Ocean Sciences
              and Earth Sciences at NSF. A portion of the support was provided by the Ocean
              Drilling Program.  San Diego State University will provide cost-share support
              for 50% of total project costs.
