Abstract    :
                   This research proposes to identify and validate constructs associated with
              the successful transition of IT professionals  (within companies whose main
              products or services are not software or IT services)in response to changing
              demands. Such companies are moving from legacy system technology to distributed
              and advanced technology; from ad hoc work practices to software engineering
              discipline; and from work products "thrown over the wall" to products developed
              with in-house customers as full participants and business partners. Because IT
              professionals are in short supply, the successful transition of existing
              employees is especially important, yet the dramatic and discontinuous change
              companies and their IT personnel face render prior work on retraining and
              retention of employees less useful. Both quantitative and qualitative methods
              will be employed, so that managerial and organizational contexts can also be
              assessed, and new factors and relationships can be uncovered through causal
              mapping. Operationalization of the dependent construct, Achievement in the
              transition role, will be drawn from the case studies. Survey instruments will
              be used to capture longitudinal change information and either verify or
              disconfirm the model developed in earlier stages of the research.
