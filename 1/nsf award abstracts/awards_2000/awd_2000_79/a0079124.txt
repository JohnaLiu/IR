Abstract    :
              This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program
              supports research on understanding the nature and applications of ultrasound in
              chemical reactivity by Professor Kenneth Suslick of the Department of Chemistry
              at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  The specific studies include
              the performance of mechanistic and spectroscopic investigations of the
              cavitation event in sonochemistry, the preparation of novel inorganic materials
              and heterogeneous catalysts, and the synthesis of biomaterials. In addition,
              sonoluminesence will continue to be developed as a spectroscopic probe of the
              conditions created during bubble collapse. 

The goal of this research is to
              understand the complex events taking place in sonochemistry, which is the use
              of ultrasound for chemical reactions. The work will focus on the preparation of
              nanostructured and amorphous metals, alloys, carbides oxides and sulfides and
              their applications as catalysts for a variety of industrially important
              reactions. In addition, a sonochemical synthesis will be developed for the
              preparation of biomedical microstructures for use as MRI agents and other
              applications. The students involved in this project will be well prepared for
              careers in both chemical and related areas.
