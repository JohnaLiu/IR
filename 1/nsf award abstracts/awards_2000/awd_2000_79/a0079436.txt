Abstract    :
              This research project is to employ high throughput screening techniques,
              combinatorial chemistry, and combinatorial biocatalysis to identify novel
              displacers and affinity ligands for the purification of biomolecules.  This
              project is also to bring together synergistically recent advances by the
              Principal 
Investigators (PIs) in these fields.  The intent is to produce a
              new paradigm for the discovery of powerful new bioseparating agents.
