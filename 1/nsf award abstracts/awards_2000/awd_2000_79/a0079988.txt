0079988

A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred on September 21, 1999,
              near Chi-Chi in Nantou county, Taiwan, about 90 miles south of Taipei,
              resulting in extensive damage, injuries and loss of life.  Extensive damage
              occurred to bridges and dams and, due to the mountainous nature of the terrain,
              there were hundreds of s landslides, including several very large catastrophic
              landslides.  A very important feature of this earthquake was the reverse fault
              rupture with vertical displacements ranging from 2 meters along the southern
              section to as much as 8 meters along the northern terminus.  The fault rupture
              extends through heavily developed areas and is responsible for much of the
              damage to major transportation and river control structures.  Since much of
              northern and southern California has extensive infrastructure development along
              active fault traces, observing and documenting the direct impact of large fault
              displacement in the Taiwan earthquake is of obvious practical and research
              interest to the US earthquake engineering community.

This action provides
              partial support for a coordinated industry-academia reconnaissance team to
              document the geotechnical and engineering geology/seismology features of this
              earthquake in as much detail as possible.  Of particular interest is the impact
              of large seismic fault offset on urban infrastructure.

As with all
              post-earthquake reconnaissance investigations, it is expected that vital
              records and data will become available as a result of this earthquake in
              Taiwan.  From a scientific viewpoint, these large earthquakes act as full scale
              experiments that cannot be duplicated via controlled experiments in the
              laboratory or in the field.  It is through quick response reconnaissance
              efforts that the mostly-ephemeral data from these events can be recovered and
              used to further advances in earthquake hazard mitigation.  The results from
              this investigation are expected to yield information and data that will help
              the profession to understand the impact of large seismic fault offset on urban
              infrastructure.

This is a multi-institutional award involving the University
              of California at Berkeley, the University of Washington, and the University of
              Southern California.
