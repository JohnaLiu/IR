Abstract    :
              The Board on Physics and Astronomy proposes an assessment of an area of science
              at the intersection of physics and astronomy. It will focus on opportunities
              for breakthroughs in understanding the birth, evolution and destiny of the
              Universe, the laws that govern it. It will identify opportunities to explore
              new science through (1) new techniques for observing phenomena in extreme
              environments and new regimes, (2) new applications of fundamental physics to
              modeling and simulating the origin, evolution, and fate of the universe, and
              (3) understanding fundamental physics by using space and the cosmos as a
              laboratory full of experiments that could never be implemented on the
              Earth.

This project is jointly funded by OMA, AST and PHY.
