Abstract    :
              The International Conference on Tetrapyrroles of Photosynthetic Organisms is to
              be held July 25-30, 2001, on the campus of Brown University in Rhode Island,
              USA.  The conference will bring together an international group of scientists
              to present, discuss, and evaluate new data and concepts in the areas of
              biochemistry and related disciplines that involve the structure, biosynthesis,
              and function of tetrapyrroles in photosynthetic organisms.  Previous
              conferences in this series were held in Davis, California, in 1991, and in
              Europe in 1995, 1997, and 1999.  The dates and location of the 2001 conference
              were selected to facilitate attendance by individuals who will also be
              attending the 2001 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Plant
              Physiologists, which will be held in Providence.  Awarded funds will be used to
              support American participants, particularly beginning independent
              investigators, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students. 
              

Photosynthesis is the biochemical process that, directly or indirectly,
              supports all life on Earth.  Photosynthesis itself depends on the capture and
              use of energy from sunlight.  Both the capture of sunlight and the conversion
              of its energy into assimilable forms of metabolic energy depend on a group of
              chemical compounds collectively named tetrapyrroles.  This family of compounds
              includes chlorophylls, hemes, and bilins.  In addition to their central roles
              in photosynthesis, tetrapyrroles are required for several other important
              processes in photosynthetic organisms, including respiration (respiratory
              cytochromes), oxygen-mediated biosynthetic and catabolic reactions (cytochrome
              P450, catalase, peroxidases), and light perception for developmental responses
              (phytochrome chromophores).  This is the only conference series that is
              specifically focused on the group of scientific disciplines that encompass
              photosynthetic mechanisms, tetrapyrrole pigment biosynthesis, plant
              photoreceptors, photoprotection, functional and biosynthetic protein structural
              analysis, and tetrapyrrole metabolism.
