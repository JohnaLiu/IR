Abstract    :
              The flow of visual information from the eye (retina) to the areas of the brain
              (cerebral cortex) necessary for visual perception is routed through a brain
              structure known as the thalamus.  Part of the thalamus called the lateral
              geniculate nucleus (LGN) serves as a "relay station" between the retina and
              visual cortex.  Current research indicates that the LGN plays an important role
              in visual processing and should be thought of as a "dynamic filter" as opposed
              to a "relay."
	The aim of this research project is to understand the
              functional role of the inhibitory mechanisms of the LGN (and nearby brain
              areas).  Of particular interest is how inhibitory neurons are involved in
              "filtering out" retinal information from this visual pathway.  The PI's
              approach is mathematical and computational. After constructing a biophysically
              and anatomically detailed mathematical model of the LGN neuronal network,
              numerical experiments will quantify the input/output properties of the
              simulated neural network.  The LGN model will then be used to predict the
              influence of inhibitory mechanisms on the relay of retinal information to
              visual cortex.   
	Because the LGN is the most extensively studied thalamic
              relay nuclei, it is a good system in which to study the role of inhibition in
              sensory processing by thalamus.  This study of a sensory thalamic relay may
              suggest approaches to investigating the role of the thalamus in intracortical
              communication, a fundamental aspect of brain function.
