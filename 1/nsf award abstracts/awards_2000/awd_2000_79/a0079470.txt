Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Oberlin College will acquire a 400 MHz NMR
              Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a)
              peptide-surface interactions and engineered biomaterials; b) direct measurement
              of secondary structure in a membrane receptor-ligand complex; c) coordination
              chemistry of alpha-azoimines; d) asymmetric catalysts; and e) mechanistic and
              synthetic studies of oxyallyl intermediates.   

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the
              elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown
              substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules,
              and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. 
              Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are
              carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an
              impact in a number of areas including biological chemistry.
