This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation
              (MRI) Program, provides partial support of the costs of acquiringa  modern,
              fully automated, low-vacuum scanning electron microscope and light-element EDS
              detector (SEM-EDS) for research and research training in Geology, Biology,
              Chemistry, Anthropology, and Museum Studies at Beloit College.  SEM-EDS
              analysis is an essential tool in these fields for characterizing surface
              topography and chemical composition at the micron scale.  Current student and
              faculty research that will be enhanced by the acquisition of the new SEM-EDS
              system include 1) metamorphic petrology and tectonic studies of the Coast
              Mountains in British Columbia; 2) subduction-zone metamorphism in Syros,
              Greece; 3) the chemical, biologic, and physical environment of microbial
              nodules from a freshwater creek in southcentral Wisconsin; 4) provenance
              studies of copper and bronze artifacts from Chile; and 5) use and wear patterns
              of stone tools from the Gottschall rock shelter in southwestern Wisconsin.  In
              addition, the new SEM-EDS facility will enhance the educational outreach
              mission at Beloit College by allowing K-12 students in the Beloit area to image
              and analyze specimens they collect.
