Abstract    :
              With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the
              Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University will acquire an X-ray powder
              diffractometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including the following: a) metal phosphonate chemistry; b) synthesis,
              structure and ion exchange behavior of inorganic ion exchange materials; c)
              micro- and mesoporous materials made from polymetal components; d) design,
              synthesis and magneto-structural correlation of molecule-based magnets; e)
              introduction of bidentate Lewis acidic functionalities in microporous solids;
              and f) synthesis of hybrid materials and products of ion-exchange
              reactions.

The X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements
              of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances
              and angles, and it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement
              of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.  These studies will have
              an impact in a number of areas, especially materials science.
