Abstract    :
              An integrated microarraying facility will be initiated in the Department of
              Molecular and Medical Pharmacology (DMMP) in the Center for Health Sciences
              (CHS) at UCLA. The facility will consist of a DNA processing robot, a
              microarrayer, a scanner, a DNA/clone resource, and a computational facility.
              The microarray facility has been designed to provide the highest practicable
              throughput of this powerful technology.

The research will cover the whole
              range of modern biology including studies of retroviruses, differentiation of
              neural stem cells and other cells, the cellular response to metals, synaptic
              transmission, neural growth factors, nitrous oxide physiology, immune system
              differentiation, neural aspects of behavior and glucocorticoid signaling. An
              important part is to improve the bioinformatics of microarray technologies
              using the data provided by the facility.

This facility will provide
              researchers and their students the ability to visualize gene expression
              patterns for thousands of genes at once and have a major impact on research in
              cell and molecular biology at UCLA.
