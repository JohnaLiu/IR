Abstract    :
              
The future of chemistry-based technician education depends upon building a
              world-class, national network that connects local activities and nurtures
              sustainability. The American Chemical Society (ACS) provides leadership in
              these technician activities, by building on existing chemistry-based technician
              education activities at ACS, communicating with other chemistry-based
              technician education activities, and establishing a foundation upon which new
              activities that support excellence in two-year college chemistry education can
              be developed. To accomplish this goal, the project (1) develops a web-based
              system to update, validate, maintain and disseminate performance-based
              voluntary, industry, skill standards; (2) establishes a network of consultants
              to build and maintain local partnerships as a basis for meeting technician
              education needs; (3) develops an on-line national clearinghouse for information
              in chemistry-based technician education; (4) provides professional development
              for two-year college faculty; and (5) provides career information to attract
              students to become technicians in chemistry-related industry.
