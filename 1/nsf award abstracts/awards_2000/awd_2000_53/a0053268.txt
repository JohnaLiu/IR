Abstract    :
              34 
Meeting the critical need identified by state industry partners, this
              project focuses on the development of technician training program components
              that prepare process technicians or operators where employment demand far
              exceeds supply and continuously incorporates advances in the technologies of
              operation. The partnership of five community colleges, industry partners, a
              state agency, and a university, represents a unique set of capacities,
              technological expertise and demographic diversity by adapting science,
              mathematics and communication courses developed by other ATE projects. The
              project through the development of a continuously adaptive set of advanced
              process technology operations modules addresses (1) unit operations, (2)
              process safety operations, and (3) systematic preventative maintenance/quality
              (including troubleshooting in emergency and malfunction events) for the
              technician operator. The modules are web-based, multimedia presentations of new
              content topics with interactive simulation models.
