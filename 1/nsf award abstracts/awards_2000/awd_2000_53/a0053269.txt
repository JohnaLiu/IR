Abstract    :
              
This project is being conducted by a consortium of two-year and four-year
              institutions including Finger Lakes Community College, Fulton Montgomery
              Community College, New York City Technical College, and Hofstra University in
              cooperation with the New York State Education Department to systemically reform
              Advanced Technological Education (ATE) curriculum in New York State. The
              three-year New York State Curriculum for Advanced Technological Education
              Project (NYS CATE) is developing, field testing, and institutionalizing 14
              articulated, state-sanctioned grade 9-14 Advanced Technological Education
              curriculum modules within three overarching areas of technology:
Bio/Chemical
              Technology, Information Technology, and Physical Technology 
(materials and
              manufacturing).

NYSCATE is engaging community college, university, and high
              school faculty; industrialists; state-level policy makers; and NSF ATE Centers
              of Excellence as collaborators in developing exemplary materials and in
              unifying secondary and postsecondary segments of the New York State ATE
              delivery system.

In its third year, the Project will expand the field test
              of its products to additional sites in New York and three other states to bring
              a standards-driven, academically integrative, pedagogically contemporary
              perspective to ATE curriculum and instruction.
