Abstract    :
              Despite the tremendous growth in the demand for trained photonics technicians,
              estimated nationally to grow from 35,000 in 1994 to 740,000 in 2000, only two
              community-technical colleges in New England offer associate degree programs in
              photonics education. If New England is going to be able to maintain its
              competitive position in the global marketplace, the number of educational
              institutions offering instruction in photonics technology must be increased,
              strong programs must be implemented, and students must be better prepared to
              enter the programs.

PHOTON is a teacher/faculty enhancement and laboratory
              improvement project. It is designed to provide middle school, secondary,
              postsecondary faculty, and guidance and career counselors from more than 40
              educational institutions throughout New England with the skills to introduce
              photonics technology and laser applications into their classrooms. Although the
              project is being developed regionally, the model and instructional materials
              developed are being nationally disseminated.

The project is conducting a
              series of workshops that develop a foundation in basic optics and laser
              principles. The first workshop, held in the fall of 2000, introduces 60
              teachers, faculty and their respective career and guidance counselors to the
              applications and career opportunities in the field of photonics. Participants
              are being encouraged to form alliances across educational levels that
              facilitate building educational pathways for students. Through a competitive
              application process, 40 teachers, faculty, and career and guidance counselors
              are being selected to attend one-week workshops in the summers of 2001. During
              the workshops, educators are provided with a comprehensive optics laboratory
              kit to teach laser technology principles in their home institutions.
              Participants also receive technical assistance to implement new curricula, and
              a final two-day workshop will be conducted to share implementation models and
              strategies.
