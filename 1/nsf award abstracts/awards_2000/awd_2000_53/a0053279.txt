Abstract    :
              Through this project, West Virginia is instituting, statewide, a new degree, the
              Associate of Applied Science in Technical Studies, which has two major tracks:
              (1) network communications and (2) computer applications. The degree is being
              offered at all 12 of the state's community and technical colleges, and courses
              are being delivered both through on-campus study and through the Web. The
              degree program is supported by the state's information technology (IT) industry
              through the advice and assistance of an industrial advisory board. The program
              provides students with an opportunity to work at a participating business or
              other organization, and provides courses that lead to vendor 
certifications
              in networking and computer applications. As part of the project, courses are
              being developed, evaluated, and redesigned; faculty are developing or adapting
              material into Web-based courses; students are participating in internships; and
              the program is being disseminated on a national level.

The new statewide
              program aims to (1) offer students promising careers in IT, (2) provide the IT
              industry a greater number of skilled workers to support the industry's growth
              and development, and (3) increase the number of students with the skills and
              interests needed to pursue study toward the completion of an undergraduate
              degree in computer science and related disciplines.
