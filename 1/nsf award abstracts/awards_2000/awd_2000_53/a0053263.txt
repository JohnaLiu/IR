Abstract    :
              Thomas Nelson Community College (TNCC) and its educational and private
              industrial partners in the Virginia Peninsula Workforce Development Center are
              establishing a Manufacturing Excellence Consortium (MEC). The project's three
              goals are to: 1) adapt and implement Sinclair Community College's ATE-funded
              module clusters in Principles of Mathematics, Principles of Science, Design for
              Manufacturing, Manufacturing Processes and Materials, and Manufacturing Systems
              and Automation; 2) strengthen and expand TNCC's existing cooperative education
              program by training faculty in co-op development, preparing faculty for co-op
              supervisory roles, adopting a labor exchange database compatible with that
              currently in use by Old Dominion University, and providing release time for
              faculty industrial internships; and 3) equip a laboratory modeled after
              Sinclair's Advanced Manufacturing Center. TNCC is disseminating its results to
              the two other Manufacturing Excellence Consortia in the Virginia Community
              College System for eventual dissemination to state and regional partners.
