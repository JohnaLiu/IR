Abstract    :
              Abstract 
Through a partnership between one of the ATE Centers of excellence
              and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a research university, the
              nation's community college and high school classrooms have access to knowledge
              of emerging environmental technologies and of on-going environmental research.
              This effort allows environmental technology education programs to not simply
              react to the changing demands of the workplace, but rather positions students
              and faculty to anticipate and prepare for emerging developments in the field.
              The project is defined by two broad goals: (1) to develop curriculum and
              educational materials that focus upon emerging knowledge and technologies in
              the environmental field; and (2) to establish a faculty exchange and
              professional development program to broaden understanding of the connectedness
              of research to applied education and the workplace. Outcomes of the project
              include: (1) the development of a series of learning modules focused upon
              "Emerging Environmental Technologies" and "Environmental Health Impacts"; (2)
              community college and high school environmental educators' involvement with MIT
              scientists in a variety of venues; and (3) a Critical Issues Conference and
              published report focused upon strengthening the linkage between environmental
              researchers, educators, and practitioners.
