Abstract    :
              


The University of Alaska Southeast-Sitka Campus (UAS) two-year project to
              Enhance Rural Access to Advanced Technology Education in Alaska builds on a
              just completed DUE ATE funded Rural Alaska Environmental Education Project. The
              project is creating specific comprehensive teaching/learning materials in
              environmental technology education for rural high schools; developing and
              supporting active, hands-on teaming in rural settings; and, enhancing
              distributive teaming in support of the post-secondary environmental technology
              curriculum at the University of Alaska Southeast.

The project provides a
              Rural Technical Educator to develop, supervise, and support job-shadowing,
              mentoring and on-site technical experiences at local facilities(water and
              wastewater treatment). The project is also enhancing access to technical
              resources by developing an interactive CD-ROM for high school students
              addressing the technology of sanitation and environmental issues. The Rural
              Technical Educator supports associate degree distance students in the remote
              villages. The Rural Educator is also supporting rural high school teachers in
              the use of the newly developed instructional materials and conducting summer
              institutes for the teachers.
