Abstract    :
              Project Summary
The Community College Research Center at Teachers College,
              Columbia University is performing case studies on four centers and six projects
              funded by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) Program to develop
              recommendations to strengthen both the ATE centers and projects and the
              colleges at which they are housed. The ATE program encourages change in the
              education of technicians particularly at two year colleges. For this change to
              be sustained and replicated, it must extend beyond the grant period and achieve
              institutionalization at the community college. Using primarily qualitative
              methodologies, the study documents the extent to which the ATE projects have
              become integrated into the broader activities of the community colleges, and
              the effects of the program on the underlying barriers known to frustrate
              initiatives aimed at reforming and improving technician education. Questions to
              be addressed include how the projects affect the pedagogy of technicians and
              others in the two year college; how the partnerships with industry and business
              affect the relationship between those institutions and the college; how the
              projects affect the development of articulation agreements with four year
              colleges and relations with secondary schools; and how the projects influence
              the relation between technical and academic faculty at the institution. The
              study identifies mechanisms by which activities and improvements generated in
              the projects are embedded in the missions of the schools, and how they engage
              faculty in professional development and the activities used to educate
              students.
