Abstract    :
              This southwestern project addresses the growing employment demand for trained
              Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technicians and analysts. This project
              also focuses on state-of-the-art GIS curriculum development incorporating
              work-based SCANS competencies and career-pathways into GIS degree programs.
              Research-based findings in technology education and minority student success,
              career pathways and project-based laboratory experiences form the basis for the
              further development of national skill standards. The objectives for the project
              include the: 1) Development of a series of work-based laboratory exercises that
              are employer-driven exposing students to the problems associated with the
              design and collection of reliable and accurate data sets using GPS and GIS
              programs; 2) Training of area secondary school faculty in the application of
              GIS and GPS as they apply to a variety of occupations that incorporate GIS
              components into current Technical Preparation agreements; 3) Increasing the
              number of rurally-isolated, minority secondary students who choose to
              participate in post-secondary GIS/GPS training for employment in currently
              unfilled GIS positions; 4) Working with the leading GIS and GPS
              software
companies in the development of industry-based skill standards; and
              5) Sharing the curriculum developed with other colleges and NSF.
