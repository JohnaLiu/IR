Abstract    :
              
Northwest Indian College, in collaboration with three other post secondary
              institutions, three Tribes, three ATE Centers, three professional societies and
              the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, is pursuing a three-year Adaptation
              and Implementation project to adapt and expand its highly successful NSF funded
              Tribal Environmental and Natural Resources Management pilot project for a two
              year AAS degree program. This new project provides a launching pad for Native
              American students to pursue a four year degree in enviromnental sciences at one
              of the several participating four- year institutions, or to access
              environmental technician and management positions at the 40 Tribes within the
              region. The pilot project was one of a very few in the country to teach
              Environmental Technology from a Native perspective, and the only one to focus
              on Marine science. It developed and pilot tested cohort-based integrated
              curriculum, infused with Native examples and Native American traditional
              perspectives, deeply infusing into the curriculum Native environmental issues
              that are vitally important to Tribes. Addressing the Tribes' expressed needs,
              and with the continuous input of Tribal communities and representatives on the
              Advisory Committee are the foundation of this project. The TENRM pilot project
              produced student retention rates over two years of over 71 % -- the highest of
              any program ever developed by Northwest Indian College. This new project
              expands the successful pilot effort to meet Tribal needs for Natural Resources
              Managers and technicians who are well-grounded in the natural sciences of their
              field, comfortable with emerging technologies, and cognizant and respectful of
              the Native worldview.
