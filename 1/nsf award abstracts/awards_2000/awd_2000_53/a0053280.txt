Abstract    :
              The transportation industry faces a growing skills gap in its existing workforce
              and lacks a qualified workforce for emerging occupational positions. The
              primary objective of this project is to increase the supply of new and existing
              workers who possess the requisite core academic knowledge and technical skills
              needed to compete in the area of advanced transportation technologies. The four
              major activities which are producing programs and products are: (1) Curriculum
              & Instructional Materials Development; (2) Faculty and Teacher Professional
              Development; (3) Recruitment and Retention of Minorities and other
              Nontraditional and Under-served Populations; and (4) Internship Experiences for
              Students and Instructors. The expected outcome is a Tech Prep Associate Degree
              Program for Grades 11-14 and for adults re-entering the workforce. Notable
              collaborations include the California Advanced Transportation Technology
              Initiative, College of Engineering Center for Environmental Research and
              Technology at the University of California Riverside, West Virginia
              University's National Alternative Fuels Training Center, Schatz Energy Research
              Center at Humboldt State University, Georgetown University Fuel Cell Program,
              SunLineTransit Agency, National Automotive Center, John Deere, DOE/Clean
              Cities, Service Technicians Society (STS), and the Coachella Valley Economic
              Partnership.
