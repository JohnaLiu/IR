Abstract    :
              This project will focus on how interface dynamics is different on the
              liquid/liquid interface, namely on the oil/water interface (O/W), contrasted to
              the gas/liquid interface, with amphiphilic polymers that have strong propensity
              to reside at O/W interface.  Secondly, expanding on the exploration of
              interface dynamics to solid surfaces, this research will study in detail
              surface-group migration in hydrocarbon polymers following plasma treatment. 
              This arises from studies of plasma-induced etching reactions on hydrocarbon
              polymers; the issue is closely associated to an important application problem
              of why the surface printability of hydrocarbon polymer films diminishes with
              time upon glow-discharge treatment.  Thirdly, porous polymeric beads will be
              fabricated that have very large specific surface areas and are made to function
              as biomembrane mimetic surfaces.  This is connected to an exploratory effort to
              design biosurfaces that can act as enzymatic catalysts.

The significance
              of the first part of this project is to develop ways to synthesize better
              surfactants that should work as better oil-spill containment materials.  The
              second part addresses the ways to improve on the printing and painting on
              plastic sheets and films.  The third part deals with new and inexpensive ways
              of screening potential drugs by use of biological catalysts mad viable on
              plastic beads and nanoparticles.
