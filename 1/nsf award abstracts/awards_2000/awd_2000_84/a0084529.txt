Abstract    :
              This award to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is for a six-month,
              scoping study to define detailed user requirements, hardware and software
              technologies, and needed support infrastructure for the Network for Earthquake
              Engineering Simulation (NEES) system for the NEES collaboratory.  The NEES
              collaboratory is part of the NEES Major Research Equipment project, which will
              be developed during 2000-2004 and operated from 2004-2014.  The collaboratory
              will connect, through a high performance network, distributed major earthquake
              engineering research equipment such as shake tables, centrifuges, tsunami/wave
              tanks, large-scale laboratory experimentation systems, and field
              experimentation and monitoring installations. The collaboratory will also
              provide a curated repository for experimental data, enable teleobservation and
              teleoperation participation in earthquake engineering experiments, and provide
              capabilities for computation and distributed simulation.  The scoping study
              will identify the needs of the earthquake engineering research community as
              well as the advanced networking, data management, and computation technology
              that will be available in 2004 and beyond for the NEES collaboratory.  Based on
              this information, this project will develop a system architecture, a detailed
              system design, and an implementation plan for the NEES collaboratory.  Project
              participants include the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and
              the Mid-America Earthquake Center at the University of Illinois at
              Urbana-Champaign, Argonne National Laboratory, University of Michigan, and
              University of Southern California.
