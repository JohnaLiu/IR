Abstract    :
              This is a planning proposal to conduct workshops and associated activities
              towards the goal of developing a research framework applicable to the North
              Carolina coastal zone.  The central theme focuses on the question of how to
              best understand, quantify and predict the consequences of large-scale
              environmental trends and forcing on coastal estuarine ecosystems.  They will
              investigate the most relevant information that might be needed from these
              systems to efficiently monitor biological health, structure and function and
              how to translate this for integrated assessments in vivo in order to better
              understand the synergisms occurring between interacting subsystems and between
              natural and anthropogenic forcings.
