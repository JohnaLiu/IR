Abstract    :
              This project is part of an integrated set of proposals for the Surface Heat
              Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean project.  The goal of the current phase of
              the SHEBA project is to use data collected during a one year experiment during
              which an icebreaker frozen into the ice pack of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas
              was used as a platform for data collection.  A full annual cycle of data
              relating to feedbacks of the ocean-ice-atmosphere system was collected and will
              be used to improve model parameterizations of sea ice response to global
              warming. This project will use atmospheric boundary layer data and a nested set
              of models to determine the appropriate scale for parameterizations useful to
              larger-scale models of arctic climate.  The activities of this project are an
              essential effort to enhance the outcome of the SHEBA research projects designed
              to improve column, mesoscale and General Circulation Models (GCMs) that
              facilitate better simulations of the Arctic sea ice response to projected
              global warming trends.
