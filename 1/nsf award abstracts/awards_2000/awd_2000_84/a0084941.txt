Abstract    :
              This project is supported by NSF as a Cooperative Activity in Materials Sciences
              between the National Science Foundation and the European Commission. The
              kilogram is the only remaining fundamental unit that is still defined by a
              specific artifact: the standard kilogram, kept at the International Bureau of
              Weights and Measures in Paris.  A more fundamental standard is needed and could
              be defined if Avogadro's number were known more accurately. An international
              consortium has been working for the last decade to determine Avogadro's number
              more accurately by measuring the physical properties of highly perfect silicon
              crystals. These studies, however, revealed a surprising occasional variation in
              the density of nominally equal quality float-zone silicon caused by the
              presence of small voids.  This project aims to develop a method for determining
              the volume of these voids accurately through high-precision measurements of
              copper dissolved in silicon.  The project is being carried out in collaboration
              with the Institute for Reference Materials of the European Commission, the
              National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the German
              Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt.
