Abstract    :
              This project is designed to examine the hypotheses that solitary bee species
              have radiated in deserts because social bee species are excluded by highly
              seasonal bloom, that nesting opportunities for ground-nesting bees are enhanced
              in deserts, and that seasonality increases floral diversity or creates strong
              selection for host-plant synchrony and pollen specialization by bees.  The
              field work will be an international collaboration that takes advantage of an
              unusual landscape experiment in the Chihuahuan Desert.  Differing land use on
              US and Mexican lands provides opportunities to use adjacent desert and riparian
              areas to evaluate how floral and nesting environments influence bee diversity
              and abundance.  This area, located in the enter of peak bee species diversity
              in the world, is well-suited to distinguish variation in bee diversity due to
              ecological factors from the natural dynamics of bees in undisturbed areas. 
              Baseline data is critical, and an abrupt change in land ownership has already
              begun to affect the ecology of the region.  The project will begin surveys
              immediately to gather distribution and ecological data at the beginning of what
              will likely be a extended trajectory of ecological and environmental change. 
              This project is supported under the guidelines of the Small Grants for
              Exploratory Research (NSF 00-2: II.D.12.a).
