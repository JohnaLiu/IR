Abstract    :
              This is a cross-national project to study government offices to improve the
              status of women and promote sex-based equality.  Five US scholars, the PIs in
              this award, will work with approximately 30 researchers from 11 other countries
              in a project that has been underway since 1995 to study law making processes
              pertaining to abortion, prostitution, job training and democratic
              representation of women, as well as the status of women's concerns in
              immigration, economic restructuring and welfare reform. Using the comparative
              method of political research, three general hypotheses will be examined in this
              research project (1) whether or not the success of women's movements in
              achieving their goals is due to intervention by women's policy offices inside
              the government; (2) whether or not women's movement success or women's policy
              office effectiveness depends on the resources of the movement and an open
              policy environment or both; (3) whether or not women's movements can be as
              successful without intervention by policy offices. The PIs have established a
              detailed set of operational definitions and procedures that will guide the data
              collection by each researcher. This plan is designed to ensure the
              comparability of the findings and thus enhance the project's potential
              contribution to empirically tested theory of institutional effectiveness and
              social movement impact.
