This award provides support for the second Workshop on
              Opportunities in Materials Theory to be held October 4-6, 2000, at NSF in
              Arlington, VA.  The workshop will be comprised of fifteen speakers presenting
              original research which highlights cutting edge research, often
              interdisciplinary, in materials theory.  Topical areas include strongly
              correlated electron systems; nanoscience to mesoscience; disordered systems;
              biological physics; and, quantum coherence.  Stipends will be made available
              for young investigators to attend.  Part of the time will also be used to
              present to attendees, particularly young investigators, information about NSF
              and avenues of support for materials theory research and education.
