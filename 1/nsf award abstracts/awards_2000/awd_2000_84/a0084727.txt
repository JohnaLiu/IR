Sarewitz, Daniel R.
Extreme events, ranging from earthquakes to
              epidemics to computer viruses, cause major societal disruption. Yet extreme
              events are also normal aspects of evolving complex systems, and may be
              beneficial (e.g., floods contribute to ecosystem health).  Scientific approach
              to understanding, preparing for, and responding to extreme events are
              Balkanized among disciplines, institutions, and sectors.  In this project, we
              are  convening experts involved with extreme events from a variety of
              perspectives, as a first step toward developing an integrated research and
              policy approach to address the implications of extreme events in an
              increasingly global society.
