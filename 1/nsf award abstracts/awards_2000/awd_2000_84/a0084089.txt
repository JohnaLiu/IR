Abstract    :
              More is known about the bacterium Escherichia coli K12 and its metabolism than
              any other free-living organism. Nonetheless, the role of 38% of its gene
              products is unknown, much less whether these products (or even many of the
              known products) are essential functions under standard laboratory growth
              conditions. This research project is using a unique Tn5 transposition system to
              define essential genes in E. coli. As an important side product, genes that are
              dispensable will also be determined. The project will use pulse transposition
              mutagenesis to create a "complete" library of transposon tagged inserts,
              transcripts will be generated that extend off of the inserted Tn5s into
              adjacent sequences and then nucleic acid hybridization of these transcripts to
              all 4288 open reading frames (ORFs) will be used to follow the growth (or
              failure to grow) of all members of the library under defined conditions. This
              procedure should allow the determination of the growth potential of null
              mutants in each of the known 4288 ORFs in the E. coli K12 chromosome under
              defined growth conditions. In addition, if the "complete" library reproducibly
              lacks certain representatives, the in vivo biases of Tn5 transposition will be
              investigated. While of considerable interest in furthering the basic
              understanding of E. coli K12 genome function, the procedures that shall be used
              should also have a number of important applied uses. For instance, in
              developing this project a technique has been discovered that should be able to
              efficiently generate Tn5 transposition events in many types of bacteria without
              the necessity of developing a Tn5 containing replicon for, or expression of the
              Tn5 transposase in, the various bacteria. This will aid in transposon
              mutagenesis of a number of interesting bacteria for which conventional genetic
              approaches have failed.
