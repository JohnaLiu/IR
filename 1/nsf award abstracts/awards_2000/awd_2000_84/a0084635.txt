Abstract    :
              This project articulates a long-term vision centered around the concept of 
an
              Internet-based Meta-Model Driven Distributed Workbench (M2D2W), and aimed at
              revolutionizing the ways in which MBS can assist engineers in the design and
              analysis of complex systems. It focuses essentially on an 18-month exploratory
              research effort whose two main objectives are to address a number of identified
              obstacles and challenges, and demonstrate the credibility of MBS for the
              engineering of civil and mechanical systems. For this purpose, the concept of a
              multidisciplinary M2D2W will be researched, a prototype built, and its
              potential demonstrated by applying it to the aeroelastic stabilization of the
              Bronx-Whitestone bridge. The stabilization study is to include the planned
              design of a new orthotropic deck, which when installed will lighten the bridge
              considerably, and the investigation of several mitigation procedures in
              anticipation of even poorer aeroelastic response characteristics.

The main
              technical purpose of the M2D2W is to provide an open, multidisciplinary,
              scalable, interactive, and Internet-based simulation environment. The outcome
              of this research effort is expected to promote and enable a paradigm shift from
              closed single discipline analysis codes, to open, multidisciplinary,
              Internet-based,what-if simulation environments. This in turn will contribute to
              transforming MBS into a practical methodology for the engineering of civil and
              mechanical systems.
