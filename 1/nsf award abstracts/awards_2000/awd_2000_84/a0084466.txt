Abstract    :
              Maples.0084466

The Carboniferous Period has been called the "Age of
              Echinoderms", yet a noticeable gap exists in our understanding of the origins
              and global expansion of Carboniferous crinoids.  A few recent studies have
              shown that assessment of crinoid and blastoid bearing faunas from outside the
              North American and Western European realms can lead to paradigm shifting leaps
              in our understanding of extinction rebound and paleobiogeography of these
              animals.  Devonian-Permian crinoids are virtually unknown from the Middle East
              into southeastern China.  Devonian and Carboniferous crinoid cups and crowns
              were recently discovered in Iran by Dr. Mehdi Yazdi.  These faunas are of
              sufficient diversity and quality to be of great scientific value.  The PIs wish
              to sample and analyze these faunas for their taxonomic and biogeographic
              importance.  With the recent thaw in Iranian-American relations, it is
              important that they take advantage of this window of opportuinity.
