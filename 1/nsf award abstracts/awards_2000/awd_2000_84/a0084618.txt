An astronomical sciences educational outreach workshop
              will be held in Cape Town, South Africa on February 2-6, 2001.  The workshop is
              expected to be small (about 15 to 20 attendees total). The purposes of the
              workshop are: 1.) to provide the attendees, especially those from the Southern
              African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO), with an opportunity to learn from, and
              collaborate with, colleagues in the field of astronomy education outreach from
              leading international astronomical centers; and 2.) to discuss the goals,
              mission, and priorities for an international astronomy educational/outreach
              collaboration. The attendees will be made up of educational/outreach staffs
              from observatories worldwide that are planning activities and programs for
              formal and informal public education that relate to their state-of-the-art
              telescope projects.

	The workshop will include representatives from the
              Gemini International telescopes project, Keck Telescope in Hawaii, the Japanese
              Subaru Telescope, the Gran Canarias Telescopio in Spain, the European Southern
              Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile, the Arecibo Radio Telescope in
              Puerto Rico, the Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas, the Southern African Large
              Telescope, and the Very Large Array Radio Telescope in New Mexico.  The
              expected outcome from the meeting is to establish a framework to inspire future
              international collaborations and coordinated programs.  During the course of
              the workshop, attendees will have the opportunity to brainstorm and share ideas
              and philosophies.  Poster papers will be presented and a compendium, following
              the workshop, will be published to provide information to help others who work,
              or wish to work, or wish to work, in similar areas.

This project is funded
              by the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary
              Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, the Education
              and Human Resources Directorate, and the Division of International
              Programs.
