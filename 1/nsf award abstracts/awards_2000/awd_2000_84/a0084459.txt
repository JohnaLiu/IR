Abstract    :
              This award is for partial support of an international workshop on "Global Ice
              Sheets and Sea Level at the Last Glacial Maximum" in October, 2000, at Mt.
              Hood, Oregon. The workshop is part of the EPILOG (Environmental Processes of
              the Ice-age: Land, Ocean, and Glaciers) Project that is intended to establish a
              new and comprehensive look at the environments of the last Ice Age and to
              foster a revision of global reconstructions of the Ice Age earth, drawing on
              progress made in the last ~20 years since completion of the Climate Mapping
              Project (CLIMAP) maps.
