Abstract    :
              This project, which will be conducted by the Center for High Technology
              Materials at the University of New Mexico, will investigate the basic physics
              of quantum dot (QD) materials that influence the performance of semiconductor
              lasers in the 1.3-1.6 micron wavelength range.  An advanced theoretical model
              of the QD will be employed to determine the bound states in single, adjacent,
              and stacked QDs.  This information will be subsequently used to determine
              precisely the transition matrix elements required for gain and spontaneous
              emission computations.  The theoretical knowledge will be tested against the
              experimental component of the program, which will investigate carrier capture
              by the quantum dot, gain, and homogeneous broadening.  Our acquired expertise
              will enable the design, fabrication, and optical characterization of external
              cavity lasers that can be tuned over a 250 nm range with threshold current
              densities of less than 1 kA/cm^2, ultra-low-chirp optical devices for
              telecommunications, and filament-free lasing in broad area devices.  Tunable
              semiconductor lasers from 1.4-1.6 micron are particularly attractive as the
              need for greater bandwidth in fiber-optic communications is increasing
              dramatically.  Theoretical studies indicate that the elimination of filaments
              and chirp in QD lasers is possible because of the QD's exceptionally low
              linewidth enhancement factor.  The impact of this project will be most
              significant at the telecommunications wavelengths of 1.3-mm and 1.55-mm and at
              "eye-safe" wavelengths operating above 1.4 mm.
