Abstract    :
              This project will innovate digital access and data mining tools for
              specimen-based collections of animal sounds.  A team of programmers will design
              the tools and implement them for use on the world's largest such sound
              collection at Cornell University's Laboratory of Ornithology.  The conversion
              of this collection to digital storage has made specimen-based research on
              sounds a reality for the first time.  No other facility has developed the tools
              required for using this non-traditional type of collection.  Specific tasks
              will include structuring the sound database to be compatible with
              inter-institution searches, designing search tools that allow searches using
              both contextual data on the recordings and extracted measures of the sounds,
              incorporating GIS tools and maps into the search interface, providing
              "thumb-nail" images for selection of subsets of archived recordings, providing
              easy access to sound analysis and comparison tools, and devising a method for
              uploading sounds by remote recordists over the internet.  These tools will
              permit for the first time rigorous remote use of sound collections by
              scientists, conservation managers, educators, and the media.
