The behavior of colloidal suspensions
              of nanoscale ferromagnetic particles (~10 nm in size), with and without carrier
              fluid, will be investigated.  Such flows, when driven or controlled by magnetic
              fields, can display a number of aspects of potential interest to practical
              applications of special interest are nano-electromechanical devices (NEMS). 
              The PI plans to take a fundamental look at the following flows, in close
              cooperation with industrial partners:  

1. Channel flows with a width of the
              order of 100-1000 nm: under alternating and traveling magnetic fields, they can
              achieve significant flow rates with only a moderate (or even reverse) effective
              viscosity.
2. Rotational motion can be applied to nanoparticles in a
              fluid-free medium by a suitable array of nanocoils on the surface of the
              channel.
3. The reverse effect, i.e. applying fluid force to particles, whose
              rotational motion will induce in turn an electric current into the
              nanocoils.
4. The fabrication of mechanical nanocomponents can be accomplished
              by using a material which is in the liquid state of high temperature, but in
              the solid state at room temperature.  Thus it is possible to apply at high
              temperature the magnetic fields necessary to give the desired flow shape, and
              then freeze.  Gear shapes seem to be an easy first step to test this
              technique.
5. The use of nonmagnetic fluids, or of surfactants, will be tested
              as way to reduce surface tension and therefore improve the detailed quality of
              the component shape.

There is a strong collaboration contemplated with the
              Ferrofluids Corporation, at both experimental/design levels.
