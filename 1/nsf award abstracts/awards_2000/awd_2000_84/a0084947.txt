The Dynamic Performance of Nonlinear
              Vibration Absorbers

The objective of the proposed work is to gain an
              improved understanding of
the dynamic response and performance of systems that
              utilize multiple
vibration absorbers and to distill this knowledge into design
              guidelines.
Of specific interest are centrifugally driven pendulum absorbers
              that are
used for reducing torsional vibrations in rotor applications. 
              These
absorbers consist of masses that are suspended from the rotor in such
              a
manner that their motion counteracts the effects of fluctuating torques
              that
act on the rotor.  This study employs both analysis and experimentation
              of
such absorbers.  The analysis focuses on mathematical modeling and
              the
application of predictive techniques, including perturbation methods
              and
symmetric dynamic bifurcation theory.  The desired performance of
              absorbers
is achieved by proper selection of design parameters that are
              included in
the formulation.  Experimentation is carried out on an existing
              torsional
vibration facility that allows for control of the mean rotor speed
              and
fluctuating torque components.  Specific topics being investigated
              include:
the application of absorbers to reduce vibrations in rotating beams,
              the use
of absorbers for shake reduction, the avoidance of localization in
              absorber
systems, absorbers for multi-harmonic excitation, and the
              transient
performance of absorbers.  By systematic investigation of
              nonlinear
behavior, instabilities, and vibration localization, this study
              offers
strategies for avoiding effects that limit the performance of
              absorber
systems, and the results are used to provide useful recommendations
              for
implementation of systems of absorbers in rotating
              systems.
