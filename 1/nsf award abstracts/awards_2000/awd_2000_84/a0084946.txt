This Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) project
              will develop and test two kinds of fiber optic chemical sensors for use in
              monitoring the chemistry of hydrothermal fluid -- seawater mixtures in seafloor
              hydrothermal system environments and in laboratory simulators of those
              environments. Raman spectroscopy using optical fibers as the light path to and
              from samples is known to work well to quantitatively determine a variety of
              organic and inorganic species in aqueous solution. In addition, a relatively
              new technique, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) spectroscopy holds great promise
              as a simple means of monitoring fluid densities. This work will evaluate the
              efficacy of each of these techniques (Raman and SPR spectroscopies) for use as
              short, and long-term monitors of seafloor hydrothermal fluids. If proven to
              operate under hydrothermal conditions, these devices could be used on manned or
              ROV dives, as nodes in cabled seafloor observatories and in laboratory
              reactors.
