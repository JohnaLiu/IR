Abstract    :
              This award provides funds to the University of Wisconsin's Trout Lake Station to
              aid in the purchase of a boat and microscope for accurate measurements of fish
              and microbes in fresh water ecosystems. The station provides access to aquatic
              systems that range from temporary ponds to large lakes and that represent a
              broad diversity of hydrologic, edaphic, and trophic conditions.  Most of these
              habitats lie within protected watersheds with low population densities. 
              Current programs at Trout Lake include several multi-investigator,
              ecosystem-level investigations as well as numerous smaller-scale projects
              involving population and community ecology, hydrology, fisheries biology, and
              basic limnology.  One major focus in these efforts has been to evaluate and
              quantify the organisms that occur in the ecosystems in our region.  The new
              equipment will improve the ease and quality of these efforts.
