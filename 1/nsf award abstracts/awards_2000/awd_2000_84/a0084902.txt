The purpose of this research is to study and model the
              2-D compaction of aggregates of non-spherical viscoplastic particles under
              external load.  A numerical model will be used in which each particle is
              treated individually, with the appropriate constitutive relations, kinematic
              conditions, contact restraints, and elimination of overlap satisfied for every
              particle in the aggregate.  The model will be used to study the effects of
              particle shape, size, distribution, orientation, and compaction history on the
              macro behavior of viscoplastic powders during and after compaction.  The
              results are expected to provide new insight into the fundamental behavior of
              granular media, including overall aggregate stress-strain response, the
              formation and evolution of force chains, and the nature of yield surfaces for
              precompacted aggregates.  The results will be useful in a wide variety of
              problems that can be represented using granular media, such as polymers,
              aluminum, food products, and others.
