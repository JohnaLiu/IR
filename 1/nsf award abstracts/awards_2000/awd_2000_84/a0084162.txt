Title: Dynamic Resonances in Mechanical Systems


This Small Grant
              for Exploratory Research (SGER) project will be used to develop an experimental
              multi-component structure which exhibits resonances that depend on the state of
              the system due to coupling of the dynamics associated with the various
              components.  The proposed coupled system will slowly move in and out of a state
              of resonance as time evolves, a phenomenon that for example is encountered in
              multi-bladed turbine disks.  Successful completion of this facility will enable
              investigations on the development of tools for implementation of reduced-order
              models and equations that capture the pertinent coupled dynamics these complex
              systems.  If successful, the proposed project will also enable advances that
              can lead to the development of tools for capture of alternative models of
              complex dynamic coupling, such as those introduced by intermittent contact and
              friction.
