Abstract    :
              The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Directorate for
              Education and Human Resources Programs (EHR) will develop a series of media
              products featuring the scientists, engineers and research being conducted in
              Science and Technology Centers (STCs) supported by the National Science
              Foundation. They will accomplish this by sending reporters from their
              award-winning daily radio show Science Update to 14 of the 23 NSF STCs, plus
              selected Collaboratives to Integrate Research and Education (CIRE) sites. Over
              a period of 16 months, Science Update will produce and broadcast 48 radio
              features, heard by a weekly audience of over two million, as well as 24 short
              classroom lessons disseminated via AAAS's award-winning Science NetLinks web
              site for science teachers. NSF will also have access to stories and interview
              transcripts for other educational purposes.
