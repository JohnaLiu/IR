Model-Based Simulation (MBS) has provided designers with
              flexible and cheaper means to explore design alternatives before physical part
              deployment.  However, question of the confidence level on a particular model
              considering the full range of uncertainties in prediction and in physical tests
              has hampered wide applications, especially when dealing with real-life
              engineering problems.  This collaborative research represents the joint efforts
              from two universities and General Motors for the development of a rigorous and
              practical approach for model validation (Model Validation via Uncertainty
              Propagation -- MVUP).   The approach will utilize the knowledge of system
              variations along with computationally efficient uncertainty propagation
              techniques to provide a stochastic assessment of the validity of a modeling
              approach. The proposed methodology will be demonstrated through validating the
              simulation models for sheet metal forming processes.  

The research is
              expected to lead to a model validation procedure that can provide a
              general-purpose stochastic assessment of model validity with the least amount
              of statistical assumptions and possibly one physical experiment.  The research
              results developed will have an immediate impact on simulating springback in
              sheet metal forming process. It is our expectation that it can be generalized
              to other engineering problems and will make a significant impact on how we view
              numerical simulations by considering all the physical and numerical
              uncertainties.  The research results will also contribute to the development of
              new courses on model-based simulation, modeling and optimization of
              manufacturing processes, and uncertainty analysis in engineering design.
