This proposal is a request for participant support costs
              ($5,000) that will enable ten young scientists (Ph.D. and post-doctoral
              students) to attend the International Field-Emission Symposium (IFES) 2000 at
              the University of Pittsburgh during July 23-29, 2000. IFES-2000 focuses on both
              the scientific and technological uses of field-emission microscopy, atom-probe
              microscopy, and three-dimensional atom-probe microscopy for studying a wide
              range of problems. The major topics covered are: (1) field emission: processes
              and theory; (2) new methods and instrumentation; (3) liquid metal ion sources;
              (4) scanning tunneling microscopy/atomic force microscopy and field- ion
              microscopy in surface science; (5) surface science, oxidation, and
              nanostructures; (6) atom-probe techniques; (7) atom-probe microanalysis and
              materials science; and (8) vacuum microelectronics. The tentative list of
              invited speakers includes scientists from Japan, Germany, Jordan, Sweden,
              Britain, France, Belgium, and the United States.

The IFES Symposia bring
              together scientists who utilize field emission, field-ion, atom-probe
              field-ion, and/or three-dimensional atom-probe field-ion microscopy for part of
              or all of their research efforts. The IFES Symposia is unique in that it is the
              only symposium that brings this eclectic group of scientists together for four
              days once every one to two years. The focus is on how these instruments can be
              used to solve a wide range of significant physical and technological problems.
              This symposium is important to researchers who use these experimental
              techniques because it is the only conference where the focus is primarily on
              these research tools and their applications to a
wide range of physical
              problems.
