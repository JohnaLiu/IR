Digital Government:  Workshop on Biodiversity Informatics

Many
              Federal agencies are involved in research, monitoring, and management of
              biodiversity.  Together with partners and cooperators in state and local
              government agencies, academia and non-profit organizations, and private
              industry, these agencies have a need for advancing the development of a
              national data and information infrastructure to better support the collection,
              management, dissemination and application of biodiversity data and information.
               To a great extent, the vision of this enhanced 21st century biodiversity data
              and information system is described in the 1998 Teaming with Life report of the
              President's Committee of Advisory in Science and Technology (PCAST) which
              called for developing the "Next Generation" of the National Biological
              Information Infrastructure of NBII.  The development of this next generation
              NBII has also been endorsed by the Office of Science and Technology Policy's
              Committee on Environment and Natural Resources (CENR) as a key component of the
              multi-agency science strategy called "Integrated Science for Ecosystem
              Challenges."  The need now is to convey the informatics research issues and
              requirements involved in developing the next generation NBII to computer
              science and information technology researchers and developers in academia,
              industry and government laboratories.  This workshop will bring together a
              broad spectrum of people from the CS/IT community in pursuing the research
              agenda and applying that technology.
