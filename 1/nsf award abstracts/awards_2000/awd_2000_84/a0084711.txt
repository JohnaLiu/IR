Abstract    :
              This is study of the structure and dynamics of unsteady, partially premixed
              flames including liftoff and stabilization mechanisms associated with triple
              flames and the effects of stretch and curvature on flame structure and
              stability.  The experimental effort uses established nonintrusive optical
              diagnostics such as laser Doppler velocimetry, particle image velocimetry,
              high-speed videography, C2* radical imaging, and holographic interferometry. 
              Numerical simulations of the flames employ higher-order time-accurate
              multidimensional algorithms incorporating detailed chemical kinetics models for
              oxidation of such fuels as hydrogen, methane, and n-heptane.  Hydrodynamic
              stretch effects on flames are studied in a counterflow burner, while the
              contribution of curvature to stretch is investigated in a slot burner. 
              Instabilities in triple flames induced by buoyancy or shear are investigated;
              simulations suggest that these occur as functions of flow rate. 
              Computationally, a conserved scalar approach based on a modified mixture
              fraction is used to characterize state relationships.
