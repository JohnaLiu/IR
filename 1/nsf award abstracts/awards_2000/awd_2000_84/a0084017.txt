Abstract    :
              An NSF-CBMS Regional Conference on Modular Elliptic Curves is to be held at the
              Department of Mathematics, University of Central Florida, August 8-12, 2001. 
              Professor Henri Darmon, McGill University, will serve as the Principal Lecturer
              of the conference.  The organizing committee will consist of mathematicians
              selected from the Departments of Mathematics in different universities at
              national and international levels.  The general area of the conference's
              endeavor is of great topical interest and has seen an explosive expansion of
              research activity in the last ten years.  Despite this intense activity over
              the past decade, there are still numerous unsolved problems and outstanding
              issues, many of which are among the greatest mathematical challenges of the
              21st Century.  Darmon, who is a consummate lecturer and a major contributor to
              the area, has a very broad view of the subject matter.  He is currently leading
              a research program to develop the recent body of work of Bertolini and Darmon
              on the generalization of the theory of complex multiplication to modular
              elliptic curves over real quadratic fields.  His lectures would serve to survey
              and unify major developments in the field, assessing both achievements and
              future directions of research in the field.  Consequently, Professor Darmon is
              an obvious choice to lead a gathering of experts in this area.
