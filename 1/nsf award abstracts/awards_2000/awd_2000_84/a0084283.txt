Abstract    :
              This project is part of an integrated set of proposals for the Surface Heat
              Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean project.  The goal of the current phase of
              the SHEBA project is to use data collected during a one year experiment during
              which an icebreaker frozen into the ice pack of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas
              was used as a platform for data collection.  A full annual cycle of data
              relating to feedbacks of the ocean-ice-atmosphere system was collected and will
              be used to improve model parameterizations of sea ice response to global
              warming. This project is to manage a Project Office for SHEBA.  The office
              activities include: data analysis, formal presentations, annual workshops,
              development of gridded images, and public outreach.  The activities of this
              project are an essential organizational effort to enhance the outcome of the
              research projects designed to enhance mesoscale and General Circulation Models
              (GCMs) that facilitate better simulations of the Arctic sea ice response to
              projected global warming trends.
