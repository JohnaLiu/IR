This three-year award, which supports U.S.-Spain
              cooperative research on scattering of surface-plasmon polaritons by surface
              defects, involves Alexei Maradudin of the University of California at Irvine
              and Jose Sanchez-Gil at the Institute of the Structure of Materials in Madrid,
              Spain. The objectives of their research are to produce equations describing the
              scattering of surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) by surface defects that can be
              solved numerically in an efficient manner; to provide information about how the
              scattering depends on the features of the defects; and to yield explicit
              analytical expressions for very narrow defects as well as for defect
              configurations of interest in photon scanning tunneling microscopy
              experiments.
 
The U. S. investigator brings to this collaboration access to
              first rate computational resources and expertise in electrodynamics of nonideal
              surfaces. This is complemented by the Spanish investigator's computational
              skills and his experience in dealing with the electrodynamics of perturbed
              surfaces. The results of this research will benefit the electromagnetics of
              disordered media in general.
