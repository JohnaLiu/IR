Abstract    :
              This project is part of an integrated set of proposals for the Surface Heat
              Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean project.  The goal of the current phase of
              the SHEBA project is to use data collected during a one year experiment during
              which an icebreaker frozen into the ice pack of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas
              was used as a platform for data collection.  A full annual cycle of data
              relating to feedbacks of the ocean-ice-atmosphere system was collected and will
              be used to improve model parameterizations of sea ice response to global
              warming. This project uses data from all environments in a column-model
              approach to examine feedbacks between changes in each environment.  A hierarchy
              of sea-ice models will be used and the results will be incorporated into the
              National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model to
              produce improved simulations of Arctic climate.  The activities of this project
              are an essential effort to enhance the outcome of the SHEBA research projects
              designed to improve column, mesoscale and General Circulation Models (GCMs)
              that facilitate better simulations of the Arctic sea ice response to projected
              global warming trends.
