Abstract    :
              The objective of this research is to study the  assemble-to-order (ATO) system,
              which is a hybrid of make-to-stock at the component (subassembly) level and
              assemble-to-order (or, configure-to-order) at the end-product (final assembly)
              level.  The usual inventory-service tradeoff, a key factor in supply chain
              management, becomes even more prominent in the ATO system, as each customer
              order typically involves a large number of components, and the stockout of any
              component will cause a delay in supplying the order. Quantitative analysis of
              the ATO system, in general, is difficult as the production-inventory dynamics
              among the components are highly correlated, driven by a common demand stream. 
              The research will focus on developing bounds and approximations based on
              various notions of stochastic order, and use these as surrogate performance
              measures, such that the resulting optimization problems possess special
              structures, which in turn lead to efficient algorithms.  

The ATO system is
              an appealing business process that provides both mass customization and quick
              response to order fulfillment, and hence plays an important role in a wide
              range of industries, internet commerce in particular.  The  research is
              expected to generate new knowledge and insights to the mathematical foundation
              and basic properties of ATO systems, and to enhance supply chain management
              technologies in the design and analysis of such systems.
