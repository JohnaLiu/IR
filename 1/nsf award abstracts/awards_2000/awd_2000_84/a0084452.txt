This award will provide partial support for the 6th
              International Conference on Seismic Zonation.  Funds will be used to offset
              administrative expenses for conference organization, venue and the development
              and publication of the proceedings of the meeting.

The Conference will
              provide an opportunity to showcase advances in science and engineering.  It
              will provide an additional opportunity to highlight applications in Federal,
              State, local agencies and the private sector that take advantage of
              developments in seismic zonation research and technology to mitigate seismic
              hazards to reduce losses from earthquakes.
