Abstract    :
              An aircraft-based cloud water collection system will be developed, tested, and
              deployed on a C-130 aircraft during the DYCOMS-II (Dynamics and Chemistry of
              Marine Stratocumulus) field program. The design improves upon previous
              aircraft-based collectors by offering an automated collection system that is
              capable of obtaining multiple, well-characterized cloud water samples for
              chemical analysis. An axial flow cyclone system provides efficient separation
              of cloud drops from the ambient air stream. Centrifugal force resulting from
              the rotational flow acts to remove cloud drops to the duct wall, where they
              accumulate and are removed through an extraction slot located downstream of the
              vanes.

Cloud water samples collected in the field study will be analyzed
              chemically. These data will be used to investigate the effects of cloud
              processing on aerosol particles and the influence of aerosol physical and
              chemical properties on cloud formation.
