Abstract    :
              This project is part of an integrated set of proposals for the Surface Heat
              Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean project.  The goal of the current phase of
              the SHEBA project is to use data collected during a one year experiment during
              which an icebreaker frozen into the ice pack of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas
              was used as a platform for data collection.  A full annual cycle of data
              relating to feedbacks of the ocean-ice-atmosphere system was collected and will
              be used to improve model parameterizations of sea ice response to global
              warming. This project will conduct quality control analyses of aircraft data
              taken during the field program.  The data will provide information about the
              ice/water in the clouds and, therefore, will be critical for determining the
              cloud properties affecting cloud radiation feedbacks in the heat budget
              equation.  The activities of this project are an essential effort to enhance
              the outcome of the SHEBA research projects designed to improve column,
              mesoscale and General Circulation Models (GCMs) that facilitate better
              simulations of the Arctic sea ice response to projected global warming trends.
