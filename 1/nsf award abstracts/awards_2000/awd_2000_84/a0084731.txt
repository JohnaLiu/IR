This Study will address the effects that extended cold
              storage conditions such as those encountered in extended shelf life
              refrigerated foods (cold stress, cold/acid stress) have on subsequent growth
              characteristics, heat tolerance, acid tolerance, freeze thaw stability, and
              virulence factor expression of E. coli O157:H7.  Studies will be conducted in
              broth as well as in a model food system, skim milk.  A better understanding of
              the effects of cold storage and cold/acid storage on subsequent growth
              characteristics and virulence of E. coli O157:H7 will enable design of food
              processing and storage regimes to minimize risk and will expand knowledge of
              cold adaptation of this foodborne pathogen.
