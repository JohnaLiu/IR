The
              American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is the recipient of
              an award for summer internship support for the ENTRY POINT! Program.  ENTRY
              POINT! a national effort to discover and develop talent among students with
              disabilities, seeks summer internship opportunities for students majoring in
              science, mathematics and engineering.  Through the program academically
              prepared students have received quality internship assignments throughout
              federal government agencies and industry. Participants are exposed to various
              career options in the Federal sector that serve as a basis in helping students
              make informed career choices and solidify career objectives.  By partnering
              with the Federal government, AAAS has been able to successfully place over 150
              students in summer positions since ENTRY POINT! commenced in 1997.  In an
              effort to continue its collaboration with AAAS, the National Science
              Foundation, one of two of the participating government agencies, will offer
              challenging assignments that will broaden the exposure of participants pursuing
              careers in science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET).  Internship
              opportunities create an unique opportunity to assist in the fulfillment of two
              core strategies related the goals of NSF's mission: developing intellectual
              capital, and integrating research and education.  As a result the Foundation
              actively participates in strengthening the infrastructure to achieve excellence
              in SMET education.
