A multi-disciplinary team of scientists has been assembled to
              study the complex issues governing the effects of human activity and climatic
              fluctuations on the interrelationships between contaminants and biota in the
              Lower Mississippi River.  Workshops and discussions will be conducted examining
              the river and its entire watershed, defining all natural forces and
              anthropogenic activities as "subsystems" whose various elements account for the
              observable condition of the "whole."  This project centers around a 3-million
              record database of water quality information for the Lower Mississippi River,
              and incorporates a new approach to comprehensive compilation of data from
              heterogeneous sources, using integrated batch analysis techniques and an
              associated geographic information system to evaluate data quality,
              comparability, and water quality trends.  Project activities will provide the
              framework for a comprehensive effort to develop a predictive model of the
              interrelated system elements and their endpoint effects on the water quality
              and ecology of the Lower Mississippi River.
