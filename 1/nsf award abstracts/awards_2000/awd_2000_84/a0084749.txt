Abstract    :
              Many pharmaceutical products are manufactured by batch and fed-batch
              fermentation processes with complex reaction mechanisms.  Slight changes in
              operating conditions during critical periods of the batch run may have
              significant influence on growth and differentiation of organisms, and impact
              final product quality and yield.  Consequently, improvements in real-time
              process monitoring, fault diagnosis, and process control will enhance product
              quality and yield, and reduce the number of rejected batches.  An objective of
              this project is to develop batch process monitoring methods based on functional
              data analysis.  The project will entail working with Abbott Labs engineers to
              develop and test such rigorous statistical methods for looking at the
              trajectories of process data.  When used in a real-time vs. retrospective
              fashion, the data analysis methods can enable (1) improved end point prediction
              and (2) the prescription of corrective action to reacquire high yield and
              desirable product properties when a batch or fed-batch process strays off
              course.
