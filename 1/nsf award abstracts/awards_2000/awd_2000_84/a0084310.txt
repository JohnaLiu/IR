Abstract    :
              This research will study the ocean mixed-layer circulation within sea-ice leads.
               These openings in the pack ice allow a greater proportion of the summer-time
              solar radiation to be absorbed which results in enhanced ice melt.  In winter,
              leads allow significant cooling of the ocean waters which promotes enhanced ice
              formation.  The finely-resolved SHEBA hydrographic data set, taken during
              intensive studies on leads, as well as remote sensing data will be used to
              guide the work.  Modeling will be based on an existing 3-dimensional convection
              model to which will be added a sophisticated ice-ocean submodel.  High
              resolution studies would examine the interactions between open water fraction,
              mixed layer temperature, and ice thickness.  Numerical studies would examine
              both winter and summer conditions.  This work will contribute to the
              understanding of the near-surface heat budget and will aid in parameterization
              of lead processes in global circulation models.
