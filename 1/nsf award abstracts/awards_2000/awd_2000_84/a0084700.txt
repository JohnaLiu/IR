Abstract    :
              ABSTRACT   0084700

Four hydrographic sections straddling the deep western
              boundary 
current in the tropical North Atlantic will be made in an effort
to
              locate a rapidly propagating pulse of Labrador Sea water
traveling down the
              western boundary of the Atlantic.  This 
transient was generated when Labrador
              Sea water production
intensified in the late 1980's.  The objective is to
              obtain
a quantitative estimate of the speed with which the deep ocean
conveys
              information about climate anomalies in high latitudes to
the tropics.
