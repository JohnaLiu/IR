Abstract    :
              Arzberger and Fountain

The San Diego Supercomputer Center has proposed to
              conduct a planning workshop to develop the interdisciplinary capability and
              technological breadth of NEON, the National Ecological Observatory Network. The
              workshop will be held from 9-12 March 2000. Workshop facilitators include Dr.
              Martyn Caldwell of Utah State University, Dr. Bruce Hayden of the University of
              Virginia, and Dr. Jim Beach of the University of Kansas. The goals of the
              workshop are to:

 determine the types of infrastructure needed for
              observatories in NEON, 

determine the types of infrastructure needed for the
              network of observatories in NEON (including        communication and
              computational support), 

address management issues for NEON
              infrastructure,

discuss coordination of research within and among NEON
              sites, and

provide advice on the challenges of overcoming the sociological
              and institutional barriers associated with collaborative research that is
              multi-institution, large-scale, and broadly interdisciplinary.

Reports by
              breakout groups and a synthesis of the emerging technologies symposium will be
              broadcast on the world wide web. The workshop will result in a report submitted
              to NSF.
