Abstract    :
              Automated biometric identification systems measure a physiological, behavioral,
              or biological "signature" from the human body or environment, process and
              recognize classifiable signal components, and then renders an identification
              decision based upon the parameters of a given application.  Effectively
              addressing the breadth of needed biometric identification system research from
              to life sciences to the computing sciences represents a significant challenges
              to industry and government.  The proposed Center for Identification Technology
              Research (CITeR) organizes the activities of faculty groups at four
              universities spanning the physical, health, and computer sciences and
              engineering, to effectively address the cross-cutting research needed to
              advance identification technology and systems in the application domain
              spanning security/law enforcement, information systems, and public health. 
              CITeR will serve an enabling role in the technical and economic development of
              this area through research of new enabling technologies, the integrative
              training of scientists and engineers across its breadth, and the facilitation
              of the transfer of this technology to the private and government sectors.
