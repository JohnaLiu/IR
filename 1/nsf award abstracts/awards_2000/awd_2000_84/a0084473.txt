Abstract    :
              
The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the
              biosynthesis, compartmentation,and function of plant isoprenoids. Recent work
              in several laboratories has revealed the presence of two distinct isoprenoid
              biosynthetic pathways in plants: a mevalonate-dependent pathway that is
              responsible for the synthesis of sterols, brassinosteroids, cytokinins and
              other terpenoids, and a mevalonate-independent pathway that is involved in the
              production of plastidic isoprenoids (plastoquinones, phytyl tail of
              chlorophylls, carotenoids, etc.). However, much remains to be learned of the
              interactions between these different isoprenoid compartments in plant growth
              and development. To address this complex problem, this PI has identified
              mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana that are resistant to lovastatin (lvr ), a
              specific inhibitor of mevalonate synthesis that severely impairs root growth of
              wild type seedlings.One of these mutants, lvr 111, exhibits extreme resistance
              to lovastatin and is defective in chlorophyll and carotenoid pigmentation.
              Interestingly, F2 population analysis suggests that both phenotypes are caused
              by a single mutation. Since this mutant exhibits alterations in the cytoplasmic
              pathway (lovastatin resistance) as well as the plastidic pathway (pigmentation
              defect), the PI will test the hypothesis that the communication between these
              isoprenoid compartments is altered in the lvr 111 mutant. This will be
              accomplished by positional cloning and characterization of the LVR 111 gene,
              which will provide insights into the flux and/or function of isoprenoid
              compounds within plant cells.
