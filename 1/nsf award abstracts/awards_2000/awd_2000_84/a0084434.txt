Abstract    :
              This project evaluates the Arizona Collaborative for Excellence in the
              preparation of Teachers (ACEPT). It investigates the more lasting impact of the
              project on the community and the teachers trained through the project. This
              includes assessment of the impact of early reforms and more recent reforms and
              assessment of the effect on ACEPT graduates and their students. The project
              determines the impact on shaping the way graduates teach K-12 science and
              mathematics,  whether or not reformed teaching methods significantly improve
              student achievement, and the change in the nature of college and university
              level instruction. The project tests hypotheses about why some teachers readily
              embrace reformed teaching methods while others remain resistant. This project
              provides valuable measurement instruments that can be used by other projects
              and data that helps in assessment of the impact of ACEPT and the CETP program.
