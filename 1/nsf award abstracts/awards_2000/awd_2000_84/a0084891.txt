Abstract    :
              Metro-Nashville Public schools (MNPS) proposes to design and implement a project
              titled: Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools (MNPS) Urban Systemic Program. 
              The vision for MNPS is to institutionalize the teaching and learning of science
              and mathematics for all K-12 students through this Urban Systemic Program
              (USP).  The overall objective of this initiative is to substantially elevate
              student interest, participation, and achievement in K-12 science and
              mathematics and to foster broader career opportunities for all students
              graduating from the MNPS.  Ultimately, this initiative would foster greater
              workforce diversity, high standards, achievements, and success for all
              students. 

 Fundamental, comprehensive and coordinated changes in education
              will be supported by changes in policies, financing, management, course
              content, and pedagogy to sustain the systemic reforms.  This USP Award will
              allow the MNPS to move forward aggressively to implement sustaining successful
              strategies that will enhance the district's capacity to provide K-12,
              standards-based, science, mathematics, and technology education for all
              students.   MNPS plan to utilize the USP resources to catalyze the districts
              investments and converging resources to improve science, mathematics, and
              technology teaching and learning for all students and to meet its' equity and
              excellence goals.
