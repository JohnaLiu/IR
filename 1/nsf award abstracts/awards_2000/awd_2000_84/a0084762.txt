Abstract    :
              Data mining is one of the very promising information technologies today. We are
              concentrating our research into two new topics in data mining. First, instead
              of optimizing construction of a complete data mining model, parts of the model
              are incrementally constructed as guided by user feedback in order to reduce the
              long construction times of data mining models. The methods enable interactive
              response times, and this research is expected to result in a paradigm shift
              away from batch-oriented mining to interactive data mining. Second, data mining
              has traditionally been performed over static datasets, and mining algorithms
              could afford to read the input data several times. This traditional approach is
              referred to as offline data mining. This research addresses the online mining
              of high-speed data streams. The goal is to develop data mining systems that
              never stop working, incorporate new records immediately as they arrive, and
              update current and construct new models continuously. This new approach is
              referred to as online data mining. Anticipated applications include the
              discovery of patterns in network data, click-stream data, text data, and/or
              biological databases.
