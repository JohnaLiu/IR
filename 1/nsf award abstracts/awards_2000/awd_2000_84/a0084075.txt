The Nebraska Sand Hills is the largest sand dune area in the
              Western Hemisphere.  Today these dunes are stable and covered by native
              grassland. However, in the not too distant past (perhaps as recently as 1000
              years ago), most of these dunes were active.  To ecologists, geologists and
              Sand Hills ranchers, this ecosystem is a "desert in disguise".   How do short-
              and long-term climate change interact with ecological processes such as grazing
              and fire to destabilize this massive sand dune system, or, on the other hand,
              restabilize large areas of moving sand?  What role do the numerous interdunal
              wetlands and lakes of the region play in stabilizing the grassy Sand Hills
              uplands?  Geologists, soil scientists, climate specialists, grassland
              ecologists, landscape ecologists, and modelers will be assembled to address
              these questions.  By combining ecological studies of the region's current
              wetlands and grasslands, with geological studies of climate change, sand dune
              movement and wetland dynamics over the last 3000 years the interdisciplinary
              team will develop a model of the Sand Hills that will facilitate predicting the
              future of this region under various scenarios of management and climate
              change.
