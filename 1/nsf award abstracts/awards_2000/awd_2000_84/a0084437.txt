Abstract    :
              This request for block international travel funds for selected U.S. authors to
              attend the 39th IEEE Conference on Decision and (CDC) to be held in Sydney,
              Australia, between the dates of December 12th and 15th, 2000.  The CDC is one
              of the world's largest and leading conferences in control theory and
              applications.  This will be the fourth time it will be held outside the United
              States.  The requested funds will be instrumental in increasing the U.S.
              participation at the conference, thus contributing toward its technical
              success.
