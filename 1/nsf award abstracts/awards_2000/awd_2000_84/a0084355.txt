Abstract    :
              The proposed high risk exploratory research introduces a new approach to the
              evolutionary question of why there is a contrast in the oxygen transport
              characteristics of Andean and Tibetan natives exposed to the same stress of
              high-altitude hypoxia. It hypothesizes that the reason why Andean populations
              at high altitude have higher blood oxygen content than their Tibetan
              counterparts at the same altitude is due to differences in the production of
              nitric oxide, a gas heretofore not measured in native high altitude
              populations. The proposed research will be carried out in Bolivia and the Tibet
              Autonomous Region of China and is designed to test the hypothesis that
              high-altitude hypoxia decreases the production of nitric oxide in the lungs
              which in turn causes the pulmonary arteries to reroute blood to the
              better-oxygenated portions of the lung and improves blood oxygen. It will test
              the hypothesis that individuals with lower exhaled nitric oxide levels have
              higher oxygen saturation, and that Andean populations have higher nitric oxygen
              levels than Tibetans as a result of their higher blood oxygen content. The
              proposed exploratory research introduces nitric oxide as a trait relevant to
              the study of high altitude adaptation and expands our knowledge of human
              adaptation to high altitude and our understanding of human evolution.
