Abstract    :
              Thermal processing is a fundamental part of almost all materials manufacturing
              processes.  Thermal processing encompasses a broad range of processes in which
              heating or cooling are used and during which process the material may undergo
              some change in internal structure and/or external geometry.  The thermal
              processing industry faces a number of challenges to continued growth and
              international competitiveness as outlined in a technology road map for the
              industry, "The 1999 R&D Plan for Heat Treating" published by the Heat Treat
              Society.  This planning grant is to support activities aimed at determining the
              feasibility of establishing an I/UCRC focused on thermal processing technology.
               The activities will culminate in a planning meeting with industry to develop a
              research agenda and commitments for membership.
