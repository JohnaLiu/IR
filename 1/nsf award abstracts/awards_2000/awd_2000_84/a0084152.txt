Abstract    :
              Earth Systems Science (40) This special project will support the Digital Library
              for Earth System Education (DLESE) Leadership Workshop: Building the Community.
              The purpose of this workshop is to inform leaders in the Earth system education
              community about the National SME&TE Digital Library initiative, and ongoing
              work in the development of DLESE. The workshop will also provide a forum to
              obtain feedback from community leaders that will be used in the design and
              development of DLESE collections, services, and related functions. Workshop
              activities will include hands-on demonstration of successful computer-assisted
              learning activities, networking and community building activities across all
              interests in Earth system education, and focus groups to become acquainted with
              the work of the DLESE Users, Collections, services, and Technology Committees.
              Participants will be provided with information and tools to become regular
              users of, and contributors to, DLESE functions, and to recruit broader
              participation among their home constituencies. Participants will be invited
              from among the leaders of Earth system education from K-12, undergraduate, and
              community outreach instructional settings. the outcomes of the workshop will be
              posted on the DLESE webpage (www.dlese.org), and reported in newsletters of
              professional societies. This workshop will be the first opportunity to engage
              the full spectrum of Earth system educators in the development of DLESE.
