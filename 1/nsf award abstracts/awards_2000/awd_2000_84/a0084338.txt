Abstract    :
              This GOALI project focuses on in-situ, real-time studies of complex oxide thin
              films composition, structure, and properties to be used to optimize film
              quality and to develop film formation models that optimize desired film
              properties.  A unique process and characterization system combining
              spectroscopic ellipsometry and low energy ion scattering, together with a multi
              target ion beam sputter deposition system for film growth is being completed. 
              This GOALI project involving systems development requires not only the diverse
              scientific talents provided by the University of North Carolina and James
              Madison University (an undergraduate institution) and Argonne National
              laboratories, but also industrial participation for the industrial hardware
              implementation phase.  Oxide films with both complex compositions and
              structures are being considered for the next generation electronic and optical
              devices.  Among the classes materials currently being emphasized are highly
              optimized thin films of superconductors, high dielectric constant dielectrics,
              ferroelectrics and piezoelectrics.  Training students for job opportunities in
              these areas is regarded as a high priority by industry.

This ROA grant
              will increase the participation of undergraduate students at James Madison
              University in GOALI project DMR-9986682.  Oxide films with both complex
              composition and structures are being explored for the next generation
              electronic and optical devices.  These include superconductors, didectrics,
              ferroelectrics and prezoelectric materials.  This GOALI will provide excellent
              training for students competing for 100 opportunities in areas regarded as a
              high priority by indarky.
