We plan to conduct a systematic study of precipitate
              hardening of aluminum alloys based on mechanism-based strain gradient (MSG)
              plasticity.  A unit-cell model will be used to represent dispersed particles in
              an aluminum matrix.  The size of the particle ranges from a tenth of a micron
              to tens of microns.  The size of the representative cell is determined by the
              particle size and volume fraction.  A computer code based on finite element
              methods for MSG plasticity will be developed to predict macroscopic mechanical
              properties as particle size, shape and distribution are varied at a fixed
              volume fraction.  This code will be validated by benchmark analytical solutions
              associated with void growth in aluminum.  The predictions will be compared to
              existing experimental data and tested by further experiments to be conducted in
              ALCOA.***
