Abstract    :
              The Institute for Complex Adaptive Matter (ICAM) was created in March 1999 at
              Los Alamos under the auspices of the University of California Office of the
              President by scientists from universities, national, and government
              laboratories to foster multidisciplinary research in the areas of soft, hard,
              and biological matter.  Support is provided for (1) organizing exploratory
              multidisciplinary workshops and communicate the results with the scientific
              community; (2) develop multi-institutional research teams on topics emerging
              from the workshops with a focus on young scientists; (3) establish ICAM
              research nodes at academic institutions and supporting programs for graduate
              and postdoctoral students, summer schools, and conferences on complex adaptive
              matter.  The award is jointly supported by the NSF Divisions of Materials
              Science and Physics, as well as the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of
              the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.
