The object of this research is to explore the failures
              of two types of critical industrial facilities during the 1999 Kocaeli(Izmit)
              Earthquake in Turkey.

The general tasks are: to study the nonlinear time
              history response of cooling towers and stacks which failed during the
              earthquake; to compare the predicted response with the field observations; and
              to evaluate the adequacy of current design procedures.

The research will be
              conducted in phases, initially considering similar structures in the U.S. for
              which data is obtainable.  Then, the research will focus on the actual
              structures in Turkey, for which one type will be selected for a more detailed
              evaluation.

The failures of the stacks are thought to have initiated in the
              vicinity of large holes in the shell wall while the cooling towers suffered
              column failures.  In the initial studies using relatively simple models, the
              dynamic characteristics of the representative structures will be determined so
              that a response spectrum analysis can be performed, followed by a local stress
              analysis.  For the structure selected for further evaluation, the dynamic
              analysis will be carried out considering the nonlinear characteristic of the
              system.
