Abstract    :
              The objective of the project is to evaluate the applicability of a pulse-heating
              calorimeter to metal systems. The experimental apparatus allows the
              simultaneous determination of the electrical resistivity (r) and the specific
              heat (Cp) from room temperature to 1400 degrees C.  An experiment, including
              processing the data, takes about an hour. This specimen in the form of a wire
              or rod is self-heated by a current from a programmable power supply controlled
              by a computer. This device can also be used to control the thermal history of
              the specimen. For example, isothermal aging can be conducted with r and the
              associated heat effects determined which occur during aging. Due to the high
              heating rate that can be employed, r and Cp can be determined for metastable
              states. This allows the calculation of the free energy of transformation, for
              example, for the ordering reaction in Ni4 Mo. If defects form during heating
              (e.g., vacancies), the associated heat effect causes an abnormal increase in
              Cp. The data can be analyzed to determine the energy of formation of the
              defects. This would be particularly applicable to intermetallic compounds, such
              as FeAl, NiAl, Laves phases, etc.
