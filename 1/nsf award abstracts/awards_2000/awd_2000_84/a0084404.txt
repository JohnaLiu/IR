These projects exploit the atomic force microscope (AFM) to
              measure electrical potentials and current-voltage characteristics of materials
              with high spatial resolution.  The work focuses on organic semiconductors and
              self-assembled monolayers (SAMs).  The first project, Kelvin Probe Force
              Microscopy (KPFM) of metal-organic semiconductor interfaces and operating
              organic field effect transistors (OFETs), employs metal-coated AFM tips to
              sense surface potentials.  Frisbie will use KPFM to measure the contact
              potential difference (CPD) at metal-organic interfaces to determine the extent
              of interfacial charge-transfer.  He will also use KPFM to map voltage 'drops'
              in operating OFETs to determine the bottlenecks to electrical transport in
              these devices.  These KPFM studies will quantify the importance of film
              microstructure and metal-organic interfaces to organic semiconductor
              transport.

The second project, fabrication and electrical characterization
              of metal-molecule-metal junctions, will use conducting AFM tips to contact
              single monolayers of molecules assembled on surfaces.  The objective of these
              studies is to characterize transport in molecules as a function of bonding and
              functional group architecture.

It is expected that fundamental understanding
              stemming from this work about the roles of microstructure, metal-organic
              interfaces, and molecular architecture on transport will impact efforts to
              improve electronic devices based on molecular films.  These studies involve
              training of graduate students in the areas of organic thin film electronics,
              transport physics, and scanning probe microscopy, all of which are areas of
              high interest to industry.
