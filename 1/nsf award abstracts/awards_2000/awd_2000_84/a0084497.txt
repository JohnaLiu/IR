Abstract    :
              This award will provide funds for the support of a workshop to discuss the
              integration of advanced techniques into antarctic weather forecasting.   The
              workshop will be held at the Byrd Polar Research Center of Ohio State
              University, in May 2000.
	The objective of the workshop is to bring together
              the atmospheric community with interests in antarctic weather forecasting and
              synoptic meteorology.  This group, which will include operational forecasters,
              numerical modelers, atmospheric scientists, and others, will be expected to
              review the current state of knowledge in antarctic weather forecasting, as well
              as define and recommend goals and research needs for the U.S. Antarctic Program
              over the next decade.
	Recent advances in polar numerical weather prediction,
              resulting from ongoing efforts at improving the capabilities of numerical
              weather prediction models for use in polar regions, and real-time simulations
              of the antarctic atmosphere using the Pennsylvania State University/National
              Center for Atmospheric Research fifth generation mesoscale model have placed
              the field of antarctic weather prediction at the brink of a period of rapid
              improvement.  This potential can only be realized through a directed effort by
              all parties involved, and a stronger link between the research and operational
              meteorology communities.
	A formal workshop on this specific aspect of
              antarctic meteorology has not been convened before.
