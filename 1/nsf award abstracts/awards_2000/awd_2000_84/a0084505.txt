Abstract    :
              This award will partially support the Second IMACS International Conference on
              Nonlinear Evolution Equations and Wave Phenomena to be held at the University
              of Georgia, April 9-12, 2001.   IMACS is the International Association for
              Mathematics and Computers in Simulation.  This award will support six invited
              speakers, students, and some direct costs.  The conference will focus on the
              computational and theoretical aspects of nonliner waves and optical solitons.
