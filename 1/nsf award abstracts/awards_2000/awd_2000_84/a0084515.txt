This proposal seeks support for a symposium on Toxic and
              Essential Trace Elements in Brain Development to be held at the Neurobehaviora
              Teratology Society meeting.  The symposium focuses on research concerning
              damage to brain development caused by both deficiencies and excesses of trace
              elements.  It is unique in that it brings together scientists who study trace
              elements as toxicants and those who study trace elements as essential elements
              for an exchange of information and research perspectives concerning brain
              development.
	
The symposium includes a diversity of participants.  One of
              the 3 organizers is a woman as are two of the four symposium participants.  In
              addition, there is one foreign contributor (Canada).   The symposium also
              presents opportunity for scientists early in their careers, in that two of the
              participants are young scientists from research groups with active programs in
              this area.
