Abstract    :
              This award supports the travel, housing and registration costs of 15 students
              who would not otherwise be able to attend the 4th International Conference on
              Multiagent Systems (ICMAS-2000) in Boston, Massachusetts, July 7-12. This
              conference is the premier conference on agent technology and will have
              associated with it many tutorials, workshops and other events given by leading
              researchers in this field. One valuable part of student training is
              participation in the excitement of an international conference where major
              researchers present their work and engage one another in dialogue. The goal of
              this proposal is to enable students who are deserving but may not have the
              financial resources available to attend. A committee of senior ICMAS organizers
              has been formed to select students based on the following criteria: 1) those
              presenting papers; 2) those presenting posters; 3) those presenting in
              workshops or other associated conference forums; and 4) those whose research
              could benefit from attendance.
