Abstract    :
              0084987
The objective of the research is to develop a model to predict
              phenomena leading to poor formability in A1-Mg alloys based on the underlying
              deformation mechanisms. Magnesium is added to aluminum to improve strength
              properties but is found to also have a detrimental effect on formability. The
              microstructural mechanism responsible for the poor formability is a process
              called "dynamic strain aging." Dynamic strain aging results from fast diffusing
              solute atoms, such as magnesium, interacting with dislocations. These
              interactions lead to unsteady, collective motion of dislocations, within grains
              and across grain boundaries, resulting in unstable flow and hence poor
              formability. At the macroscopic level, a key defining manifestation of flow and
              hence poor formability. At the macroscopic level, a key defining manifestation
              of dynamic strain aging, is a negative strain rate sensitivity. Predicting this
              phenomenon and the resulting poor formability, based on microstructure events,
              is the primary objective of this work.***
