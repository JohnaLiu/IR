This dissertation
              study will examine the fit between social work and the culture of Alaska's
              Yup'ik people. Scholars have demonstrated that other western systems are ill
              matched with Yup'ik cultural expectations and practices. This study will
              document whether the practice of social work is another example of cultural
              mismatch by examining the everyday institutional practices of social service
              provision in four Yup'ik villages. Methods will include participant observation
              with semi-structured and unstructured interviews.
