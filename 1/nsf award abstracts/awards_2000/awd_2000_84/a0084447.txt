Abstract    :
              
The essence of this program is to investigate intertemporal effects in quantum
              measurements utilizing an optoelectronic experimental setup. The goal of the 
              project is to realize  an idea identified as a "backward time telegram" based
              on the experimental setup of  the "delayed choice quantum eraser". 

A
              telegram code, or a string of bits, consisting of "0"s and "1"s shall be used
              for active control of an optical switch to make the "delayed choice" of 
              "which-path" or "both-paths". The particle-like or wave-like behavior of a
              light quantum, which corresponding to code "0" or code "1" respectively, will
              be registered in a much early time even before the generation of the code. The
              code may be considered as a message, a string of bits to be transmitted. The
              working principle of  this "Backward Time Telegram" could then be
              demonstrated.

The project will extend a previous experiment by the PI,
              entitled "Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser," reported in Physical Review Letters,
              Vol. 84, No. 1, 2000. This new extension will clarify the alternative possible
              explanations of the prior results, and thereby take a significant step towards
              a deeper understanding of the role of intertemporal effects in the process of
              measurement in quantum field theory.

Recent work in quantum information
              sciences (QIS) has demonstrated the great importance of the measurement
              process, particularly in regards to the interface between macroscopic and
              microscopic phenomena. A better understanding of that interface may be very
              important, in the long-term, to a better understanding of the design space
              available to the emerging field of QIS and quantum computing.
