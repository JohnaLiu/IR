The objective of
              this project is to use novel anodic dissolution techniques to produce highly
              ordered, nanometer-sized holes in aluminum.  In a series of experiments, single
              crystal aluminum substrates with 111, 110, and 100 orientations will be used. 
              Complementary numerical simulations will demonstrate how the crystal
              orientation affects the pattern development during electropolishing.  The
              procedure for producing nanoscale patterns is to apply a constant bias voltage
              on the aluminum substrate in an acidic alcohol-water solution.  The applied
              voltage causes the aluminum to dissolve as aluminum ions into the solution. 
              Although striped patterns have been observed, these are not of current
              industrial interest.   Conditions that favor the formation of ordered hexagonal
              patterns will be explored.  Collaboration with the University of Alabama
              laboratory on Materials for Information Technology (MINT) is anticipated.  This
              facility is an NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC). 
              Students will have use of the facility for work on this project.  Ordered
              arrays of nanometer-sized holes form the basis for a number of emerging
              technologies including magnetic media, photonic bandgap filters, and molecular
              sieves.  A new fabrication method that produces such arrays would be
              potentially useful in the development of these devices.
