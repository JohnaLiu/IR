Abstract    :
              The National Research Council's Board on Mathematical Sciences (BMS)
              and
Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) are planning a
              1.5-day
workshop to explore the actual and potential breadth and depth of
              their
fields' mutual interface. The goals of the planned workshop are to
              demonstrate
the potential for additional cooperation between the mathematical
              sciences and
computer science and to begin building some new research
              collaborations.

The workshop is planned for April 28 (afternoon) and all
              day on April 29, 2000.
It will be held at an NRC facility in Washington, D.C.
              At least 25-30 researchers
will be invited to (1) share research interests
              that are of interest to both
fields, and (2) discuss whether further steps by
              the NRC are necessary to encourage
collaborations between the fields.
This
              activity will be funded jointly by the Division of Mathematical Sciences
              of
the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, and the Division of
              Computer
and Computation Research of the Computer, Information Sciences and
              Engineering
Directorate.
