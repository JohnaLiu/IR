Abstract    :
              Cedar Point Biological Station provides research opportunities and advanced
              course work in field biology, with special emphasis on prairie ecology,
              insect-plant interactions, animal behavior and parasitology. Cedar Point is
              located in the North Platte River valley, in a location that gives its faculty
              and students excellent access to a variety of ecosystems and habitats including
              the Nebraska Sand Hills. Cedar Point was founded in 1975 and has established a
              strong educational program and an outstanding record of research productivity. 
              Cedar Point Biological Station has been awarded funds to construct a new
              Resource Building, which will include space for a new library, computer lab,
              classroom and seminar room. Provision of this space will then allow better
              access to the biological collections of the station. It will also allow for
              improvement and expansion of the dining hall and teaching facilities in
              existing buildings. The resources provided by this award will allow for a
              substantial increase in the capacity of Cedar Point Biological Station to
              provide opportunities for research and education in field biology to faculty,
              graduate students and undergraduates for many years.
