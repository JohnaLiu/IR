Abstract    :
              Dinman 0084559  
The project involves two major paradigm shifts: 1) that
              certain cellular mRNAs use programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) as a
              post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism, and 2) that -1 PRF is used to
              regulate two intracellular signaling pathways (the Jun Kinase and Stress
              Activated Protein Kinase pathways) that play critical regulatory roles in the
              control of cell growth, division, differentiation and apoptosis.  A
              bioinformatic strategy combining genome DNA database analysis and DNA
              microarray technology will be used to test this hypothesis.  Computer analyses
              of the large DNA databases have been used to identify and generate databases of
              cellular genes that contain potential -1 PRF signals.  This project utilizes a
              DNA microarray approach to identify cellular mRNAs that are specifically
              stabilized by addition of anisomycin, a drug that specifically inhibits -1 PRF
              and activates these two signaling pathways.  Initial experiments will be done
              using a yeast-based system due to its experimental malleability.  These will
              allow for testing of the general hypothesis and fine-tuning of the technology. 
               From there, the project will continue using human cell lines.  The resulting
              databases of anisomycin- stabilized mRNAs will be cross-referenced with the
              database of -1 PRF signal containing- genomic sequences from both yeast and
              humans.  It is envisioned that this approach will identify the mRNAs that serve
              as the critical checkpoints in the regulation of these essential cellular
              signaling pathways.  Positive results may have significant impact on our
              understanding of many of the underlying causes of birth defects, cancer and
              aging.
