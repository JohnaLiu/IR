              Abstract:
The Fourth International Conference on Formal Methods for Open
              Object-Based
Distributed Systems (FMOODS 2000) will be held at Stanford
              University September 6-8, 2000.  The organizing committee is chaired by Carolyn
              Talcott (Stanford University) with co-organizers Scott Smith (PC Chair, The
              Johns Hopkins University) Nalini Venkatasubramanian (University of California
              at Irvine), and Sriram Sankar (Metamata Inc.).

The conference series was
              initiated by Elie Najm and Jean-Bernard Stefani, who organised the first FMOODS
              in Paris in 1996. The second was held in Canterbury in 1997, and the third was
              held in Florence in 1999.  FMOODS 2000
will be the first time the conference
              is held in the US.  By bringing the conference to the US we are hoping to
              increase the US participation in the series, and to bring more US researchers
              into the FMOODS community.

The objective of FMOODS is to represent work at
              the convergence of three important and related fields: formal methods,
              distributed systems, and object-based technology. This convergence is
              representative of some of the latest advances in the field of distributed
              systems (for example, the ODP reference model and the work of the OMG) and
              provides links between a number of important communities (for example,
              FORTE/PSTV, ICODP, ECOOP, et  cetera).
