	This project will develop two autonomous drifting buoys
              capable of measuring vertical fluxes of heat, salt, and momentum in the upper
              layers of an ice-covered polar ocean.  Recent advances in low powered sensor
              technology has made possible the development of ice-deployed buoys capable of
              measuring oceanic fluxes directly, and make possible regional studies of the
              coupled ice-ocean-atmosphere system.  One of these two instruments will measure
              fluxes using an eddy correlation method within the weakly stratified oceanic
              mixed layer.  A flux probe integrated with an acoustic doppler current profiler
              will allow the estimation of turbulent dissipation rates.  Internal micro-power
              computers will process and analyze the data streams and hold the resulting
              information for uplink to low orbit satellites.  Two-way communication through
              the satellite link will facilitate diagnostic modes of operation, which are
              critical for long term (15 months) remote instrument systems.  The second of
              the two instruments will measure heat fluxes using a dissipation method within
              the thermocline.  A profiling instrument package will contain dual
              microthermistors which can resolve the temperature gradient spectrum to
              dissipation scales, even in the strongly stratified pycnocline found at the
              base of the mixed layer in polar oceans.
