The
              principal investigator intends to use the Elian Gonzalez controversy as a means
              of testing the moral mandate hypothesis.  Most social psychological research
              has shown that if people judge the procedure to be fair, then they will judge
              the outcome of that procedure to be fair.  The moral mandate hypothesis
              suggests that if people have strong a priori beliefs concerning what
              constitutes a fair outcome, then their evaluation of the outcome trumps any
              judgment concerning the procedure.  For example, if a person feels that Elian
              Gonzalez should return to Cuba, then the person will deem the granting of
              asylum to be unfair no matter what procedure is followed.

The principal
              investigator will collect a random sample of adults before the resolution of
              the Gonzalez situation in order to locate persons who do or do not have a
              "moral mandate" with regard to this issue.  Those who do are predicted to base
              their fairness estimates on the outcome.  Those who do not are predicted to
              base their fairness estimates on the procedure.
