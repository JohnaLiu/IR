Abstract    :
              This project is part of an integrated set of proposals for the Surface Heat
              Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean project.  The goal of the current phase of
              the SHEBA project is to use data collected during a one year experiment during
              which an icebreaker frozen into the ice pack of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas
              was used as a platform for data collection.  A full annual cycle of data
              relating to feedbacks of the ocean-ice-atmosphere system was collected and will
              be used to improve model parameterizations of sea ice response to global
              warming. This project will analyze data sets of surface properties for the
              atmospheric boundary layer and cloud-microphysics to identify the parameters
              controlling cloud-radiation feedback.  Better parameterization of the feedbacks
              will allow other investigators looking at additional aspects of cloud-radiation
              feedback mechanisms to improve model simulation of the heat budget.  The
              activities of this project are an essential effort to enhance the outcome of
              the SHEBA research projects designed to improve column, mesoscale and General
              Circulation Models (GCMs) that facilitate better simulations of the Arctic sea
              ice response to projected global warming trends.
