Biological rhythms are periodic or cyclic changes in
              acitivity that occur in virtually all living organisms.  The time scales of
              such cycles may be shorter than seconds, or the well-known daily (circadian)
              rhythms of waking and sleeping, or long-term seasonal changes of reproduction. 
              The organisms studied range from unicellular microbes to complex plants and
              animals, and the approaches range from the molecular to behavioral.  The
              Society for Research on Biological Rhythms (SRBR) has a biennial meeting that
              brings together diverse researchers in the field, and also introduces
              scientists in related fields to the biologicaly rhythms community.  In addition
              to regular slide and poster presentations, this meeting has tutorial sessions,
              review lectures, and a symposium on a particular topic, to promote
              cross-disciplinary interactions.
The NSF contribution supports attendance by
              graduate students, postdoctoral students and young faculty who otherwise do not
              have the resources to attend.  This conference wil have an impact on these
              groups by introducing them to the current leading edge of the field and to
              potential future mentors, and will have an impact on biological sciences in
              general because of the fundamental importance of biological
              rhythms.
