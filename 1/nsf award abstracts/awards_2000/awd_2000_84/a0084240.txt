Abstract    :
              Extremophile Research: Theory and Techniques is a course presented by the
              American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) under the auspices of the Center of
              Marine Biotechnology (COMB), University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute,
              and George Mason University's Institute for Bioscience, Bioinformatics, and
              Biotechnology (IB3). The four-day course will be held at COMB facilities in the
              Columbus Center, Baltimore, MD, during the summer each year for the next three
              years. Year one, the course will be held from July 24 to July 27, 2001; dates
              for years two and three will be determined in January of 2002 and 2003,
              respectively. "Extremophile Research: Theory and Techniques" includes a one-day
              symposium and a three-day intensive laboratory workshop. The symposium brings
              experts from various areas of extremophile research to present the current
              state of knowledge on growth, biochemistry and genetics of extremely anaerobic
              methanogens, hyperthermophiles and extreme halophiles. The laboratory sessions
              includes lectures, demonstrations and hands-on experiments in the specialized
              techniques used to study these organisms. Because of the high operating costs
              for the laboratory sessions, accessibility to faculty from small colleges and
              universities as well as post-doctoral and graduate students is limited by their
              ability to secure funds. To address this problem, funds will be used to provide
              full tuition scholarships to facilitate the attendance of graduate students and
              post-doctoral students working in various areas of extremophile research as
              well as half tuition fellowships to faculty from small colleges and
              universities who will be able to include these experiments in their curriculum.
