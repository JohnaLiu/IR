The objective of this research project is to test the
              hypothesis that stress-mediated regulation of nitric oxide (NO) and
              endothelin-I (ET-1) plays a key role in governing the growth and remodeling in
              carotid arteries that is induced by sustained alterations in blood flow. The
              hypothesis is to be examined by comparing morphological, immuno-histochemical,
              and biomechanical data at multiple time-points (I 2 hrs, 1, 3, 5 and 7 days)
              under four conditions: normal regulation of NO and ET- I (i.e., vasodilatation
              or vasoconstriction) in response to equal increases or decreases in flow versus
              equal vasodilation via adenosine plus a NOS-inhibitor or vasoconstriction via
              norepinephrine plus a ETA receptor blocker.

Two potentially broad results of
              the proposed project are (a) the construction of a novel computer-controlled ex
              vivo pulsatile perfusion system for small arteries that enables testing for
              7-10 days, and (b) development of a new theory of constrained mixtures for
              mathematically describing growth and remodeling in soft tissues. Both would be
              key advances, and together would provide a general experimental and theoretical
              foundation for future studies on vascular biology and mechanics (including
              tests on knockout mouse models).
