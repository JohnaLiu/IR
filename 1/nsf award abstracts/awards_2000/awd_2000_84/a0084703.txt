Abstract    :
              As the transistors in microprocessor chips continue to decrease in size,
              specific materials and design issues must be addressed as outlined in the
              National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors. This project addresses the
              problem of replacing the SiO2 gate dielectric with a high dielectric constant
              material. This proposed work will use organometallic chemical vapor deposition
              to deposit HfO2, Al2O3 and HfAlxOy. Various oxygen sources including O2, H2O,
              and N2O will be used to optimize film properties by minimizing hydrogen and
              carbon contamination.  A remote plasma containing the oxygen precursor and
              helium will also be used to create reactive oxygen containing species to
              optimize film properties. Carbon impurity concentration will be correlated to
              film properties. The proposed work will lead to an increased understanding of
              remote plasma organometallic chemical vapor deposition and will benefit other
              developing areas of research. These areas include the manufacture of displays
              and devices on plastic substrates, optical coatings on low temperature glasses,
              piezoelectrics for MEMS, and photovoltaic device applications such as
              antireflection coatings and transparent conductors.  The primary objectives of
              this study are to demonstrate uniform film deposition of HfO2 , Al2O3, and
              HfAlxOy on Si by remote plasma enhanced OMCVD, and to extensively characterize
              the films by transmission electron spectroscopy,  XPS, C-V measurements, among
              others.
