Abstract    :
              This workshop is designed to promote public-private partnering to further the
              development and usefulness of the National Biological Infrastructure (NBII). 
              The NBII Framework has as its goals: obtaining the broadest possible
              participation of both public and private sectors; encouraging greater
              coordination of and support for R&D on advanced systems and technologies;
              promoting use of collaboratively developed standards; increasing federal R&D to
              support biodiversity and ecosystems informatics; and cooperatively developing
              the long-range implementation plan for the NBII-2.  During the day and a half
              gathering, 40 executives and educators from corporations, non-profits, and
              non-governmental organizations will address issues of how NBII-2 can meet needs
              of industry and public sector interests, intellectual property rights, and
              means to capture interests of various constituencies.  Outcomes of the workshop
              will include focused white papers that may help to educate the public and
              provide new directions for the NBII program.
