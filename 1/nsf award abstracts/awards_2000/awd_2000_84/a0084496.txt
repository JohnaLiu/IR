Abstract    :
              Three studies will be conducted using functional magnetic resonance imaging to
              test hypotheses about psychological processes and neural systems that support
              self-regulation. The first experiment targets the ability to regulate the
              self-concept in response to an ego threat by either self-enhancing or changing
              an attitude. The second experiment targets the ability to regulate emotion
              through suppression of an emotional response or reappraisal of an affective
              stimulus. The third experiment targets the ability to regulate thought through
              the suppression or expression of target cognitions. Together, these studies
              will provide new insight on the common and distinct neurofunctional systems
              used to regulate the self-concept, emotion, and thought.
