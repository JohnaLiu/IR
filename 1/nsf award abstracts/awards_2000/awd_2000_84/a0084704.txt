This Americas award will support travel and related expenses
              for a Planning Visit to Peru organized by Dr. James S. Albert, University of
              Florida, with the collaboration of one Canadian and two other Latin American
              researchers from several zoological disciplines.  The proposed visit is to
              organize a faunal survey of floating meadows in the  Pacaya-Samiria National
              Park, a highly diverse aquatic community in the Peruvian Amazon.  The planning
              visit will help to forge a research methodology and reach agreement on specific
              research sites.  Since the proposed research will be interdisciplinary, it is
              essential that the organizers have an opportunity to agree on conceptual
              approaches and practical field research methods.        

Documenting the
              fauna of floating meadows is essential for planning fisheries management and
              conservation in the Amazon, and the future project will provide baseline
              biodiversity and genetic data for use in future studies in systematics,
              ecology, and conservation biology.
