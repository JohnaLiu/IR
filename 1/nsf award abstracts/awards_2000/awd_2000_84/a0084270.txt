Abstract    :
              The PI will use climate and photochemistry models to simulate changes in climate
              and atmospheric composition due to changes in both natural and anthropogenic
              climate forcing factors, estimate the statistical significance of the simulated
              changes, and  determine feedbacks that occur as a result of including
              interactive photochemistry into climate system models. The research is divided
              into the following six related projects: (i) study of CO2 and CH4 induced
              climate change with interactive photochemisty; (ii) study of whether the sun
              has changed climate; (iii) simulations of the changes in climate and
              atmospheric composition induced by the Pinatubo volcanic eruption; (iv)
              simulations of the climate and atmospheric composition of the last glacial
              maximum; (v) study of the interactions between tropospheric ozone and climate;
              and (vi) continuation of collaborations on climate impacts and policy and
              participation in model intercomparison projects. The PI will estimate impacts
              and effects on an adaptive decision strategy for climate-change abatement. The
              work is important because it will increase our understanding of climate
              variability on longer time scales. The research also has important implications
              for climate change policy.
