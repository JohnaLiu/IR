In modern engineering practice, systems and components that rely
              on
frictional response are ubiquitous.  Clutches, brakes and rubbing
              seals
are well known examples from mechanical engineering. Despite the
              apparent
simplicity of the sliding contact problem, its economic importance,
              and
the efforts that have been devoted to research on this topic
              recent
decades, a detailed physical understanding of many aspects of
              behavior
remains elusive, particularly those associated with thermal effects.
              In
this project, supported under the initiative on Exploratory Research on
              Model Based Simulation, we will develop a computational mechanics approach
              to
modeling these problems based on a multi-level boundary element
              method
which can be scaled up to solve large problems. An
              unsteady
three-dimensional thermomechanical formulation that includes
              surface
texture and near-surface nonlinearities will be implemented. A
              speed
or temperature dependent friction will be employed. The
              computational
methods, while fully three-dimensional in nature, will initially
              be
applied to a series of rotating ring geometries that will be studied in
              a
parallel program of physical experiments.  The experiments will be
compared
              with computational results based on full field deformation
analysis of a
              stationary ring or disc under both constant and unsteady
sliding conditions.
