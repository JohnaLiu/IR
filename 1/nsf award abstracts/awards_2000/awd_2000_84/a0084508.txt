Abstract    :
              This award supports the use of boundedly-rational agent-based models to study
              the emergence of multi-agent "trusted information structures" in a rudimentary
              societal group setting by incorporating models of trust and emotion in these
              agents. As these agents exchange only information, the emergence of these
              trusted structures represent a primitive (but fundamental) form of
              organizational learning and adaptation. However, the social setting complicates
              matters, as the adjustment of these structures is also purely informational -
              through gossip about the other agents, choices to trust other agents or not,
              and emotional-type responses to particular categories of events. The
              computational formulation of the model integrates theories from psychology,
              sociology, and anthropology. This research advances knowledge at the
              interstices of social and computational sciences, provides insight into the
              emergent forms of advice networks occurring on the Internet, explores how
              elementary forms of emotion alter agent (and group) behaviors, and contributes
              to the linking of agent properties to emergent group and organizational
              learning and behaviors.
