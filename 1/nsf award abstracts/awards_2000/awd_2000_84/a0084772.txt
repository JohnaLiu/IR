Abstract    :
              The Birmingham Public School District has established a strong infrastructure in
              support of its thrust to improve the science, mathematics, and technology (SMT)
              education for all of its K-12 students.  The goals and objectives of the
              Birmingham Urban Systemic Program (BUSP) are to enhance the system's capacity
              to provide a rich and challenging curriculum in that regard.  To accomplish
              these goals and objectives, the District intends to incorporate the activities
              proposed in the USP into those that are outlined in its new Strategic Plan. 
              This design strategy will provide further assurance that the state's higher
              requirements for science and mathematics will come to fruition.   

Efforts
              will be purposefully focused at the classroom level as prescribed by the
              Alabama State Course of Study.  A plan is operable in the District to acquire
              standards-based instructional materials for all grades.  Extensive professional
              development will be provided for all teachers and all schools via embedded-day
              activities.  Special sessions, task-specific workshops, and academic-year and
              summer institutes will be offered through the new McWane Professional
              Development Center.  Longstanding partnerships with local colleges and
              universities will assist the District in delivering SMT content as prescribed
              in the Alabama State Course of Study.
