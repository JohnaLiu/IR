Abstract    :
              This project supports a two-day workshop addressing topics in the general area
              of hierarchical scientific visualization. This includes topics such as
              hierarchical data representation and approximation; using hierarchical data
              representations for the purposes of interactive visualization emphasizing
              level-of-detail, adaptive, and view- dependent strategies; hierarchical data
              representations as they relate to distributed, remote, and collaborative
              visualization applications; and hierarchical visualization in immersive and
              virtual reality environments. The workshop will take place at Lake Tahoe, NV,
              on October 15-17, 2000.
