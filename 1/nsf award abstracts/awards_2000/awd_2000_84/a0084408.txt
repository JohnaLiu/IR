This proposal is to support a workshop that will be designed
              to explore issues related to the future of nano-scale and molecular
              electronics. In particular, issues related to computer architectures for
              molecular and nano-electronics, chemical self-assembly as a fabrication
              technology, and the expected scientific challenges associated with making
              molecular electronics a reality will be discussed.  The meeting will include
              presentations by leading practitioners in the fields of computer architecture
              and design as well as physical scientists working in the areas of nanoscale
              systems and molecular electronics.  Of potential interest to both of these
              groups is the field of neuroscience, and a small number of participants (and a
              corresponding few scientific presentations) will be from that field.  The goal
              of this workshop will be to explore the common ground that exists between
              computer architecture, molecular and nano-scale electronics, and neuroscience. 
              The result will be a document that can assist the NSF in developing a strategy
              for funding these various areas.  The workshop is being co-funded by NSF
              Divisions:  ECS/ENG, CTS/ENG, DMR/MPS, DBI/BIO AND EIA/CISE.
