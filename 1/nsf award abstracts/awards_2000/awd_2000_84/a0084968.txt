This project addresses techniques to measure present-day
              deformation of seafloor crust in the vicinity of mid-ocean ridges. By measuring
              the acoustic range directly between seafloor mounted transducers on the Juan de
              Fuca Ridge, the rate at which crustal plates move over long time periods can be
              precisely measured.  To continue an ongoing plate monitoring effort, the
              existing installation will be replaced prior to 2002 at which time the
              batteries will likely be depleted to a level that will not permit
              intra-transponder ranging. This project allows construction of a second
              generation instrument that will address shortcomings in the existing
              installation while maintaining an unbroken time series of crustal motion
              measurements from 1994 through 2001 to 2006. The proposed design will be a new
              type of seafloor instrument that can be configured to extend the temporal and
              spatial sampling to hourly/daily measurements over 10-km scale distances. The
              new design will incorporate both horizontal and vertical crustal deformation
              measurements in an intelligent controller that will respond to changes in
              background measurements of temperature, pressure, tilt and travel times as
              sustained deviations from background measurements may indicate the onset of
              tectonic activity. The multiple sensors and extended spatial coverage of the
              new system will be applicable to other ridges or across other seafloor faults
              e.g., on continental shelves at subduction zones. In year one, the instruments
              will be constructed and tested during a month-long deployment in waters
              off-shore San Diego. In year two, the instruments will be deployed across axial
              Cleft of the South Cleft Segment on the Juan de Fuca Ridge.
