Abstract    :
              Drs. L. Kidder and S. Teukolsky will carry out research in
              numerical
gravitation, and will develop new algorithms for
              supercomputer
simulations of solutions to the Einstein Equations. The focus is
              to
track the coalescence and merger of binary black hole systems and
              to
calculate the gravitational waveform emitted by such processes.
              The
investigators will apply the computational technique of
              pseudospectral
collacation to this problem. The study of reliable waveforms is
              particularly timely.

The theoretical solution of this problem is remarkably
              difficult.
While the technique used in this study are new for this
              application, it
has proven successful in many other areas, and shows much
              promise for
improving computational efficiency in this area.  The
              radiation
processes under study are the primary target for gravitational
              wave
detectors, such as LIGO, currently under construction.
