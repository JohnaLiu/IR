Abstract    :
              This project will support a Workshop on Global Priorities for Coelacanth
              Research and Conservation for the 21st Century.  The workshop will bring
              together experts, policy makers, conservationists, and active researchers on
              coelacanth biology for the purpose of quantifying the present state of
              knowledge of coelacanth biology, and ensuring the continued survival of these
              ancient fish.  Thought to have been extinct for millions of years, the chance
              discovery of coelacanths in 1938 has focused much research and interest on
              their biology.  A recent, highly unexpected finding of a new species in
              Indonesian waters has prompted numerous research questions regarding geographic
              range, dispersal, gene flow, and speciation.  The workshop results will be made
              available on the web, and in a printed volume.
