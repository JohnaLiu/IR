Abstract    :
              This proposal is a request for funds to enable/assist students and junior
              researchers to attend the Strangeness in Quark Matter conference, to be held in
              Berkeley, California on July 20-25, 2000.  The scope of this conference is
              strangeness production in Heavy Ion collisions, strangeness and the search for
              Quark Gluon Plasma, Strange Matter, and Astrophysical aspects of Strangeness. 
              The conference is especially interesting this year from the standpoint of heavy
              ion collisions, because of provocative data from the CERN heavy ion program and
              the first collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven which
              might occur at the time of the conference.
