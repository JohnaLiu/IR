Abstract    :
              This research project will improve the representation of Arctic upper-ocean -
              sea-ice processes in global climate models.  An existing general circulation
              model of the oceans of a resolution to describe meso-scale surface ocean eddies
              would be used.  It will be coupled to a model of sea-ice circulation and
              sea-ice thermodynamics which quantity the seasonal processes of sea-ice
              formation and melting.  An atmospheric boundary layer model would be included
              which would define the balances between visible and infrared radiation, winds,
              and atmospheric conditions near the sea-ice boundary.  The model would then be
              used to test simplified parameterizations of the ice-albedo feedback and of
              ocean mixed layer dynamics to see which parameterizations best describe
              conditions observed during the year-long SHEBA experiment.  The
              parameterizations which best fit the SHEBA data would then be utilized to
              examine role of meso-scale surface ocean eddies on ice dynamics and its impact
              on the ice-albedo feedback.  These studies will result in better descriptions
              of the Arctic Ocean in global climate models.
