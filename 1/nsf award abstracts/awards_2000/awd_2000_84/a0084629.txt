This research is supported under the initiative Exploratory
              Research on Model-Based Simulation.  Analytical and numerical tools are
              developed to efficiently predict the effective magneto-mechanical behavior of
              ferromagnetic Fe particle reinforced elastomer composites and their structures.
              The project focuses specifically on the effects of saturated magnetostriction
              of Fe particles, finite hyperelasticity of elastomer matrix, and the
              fabrication curing-induced residual stresses, on the effective constitutive
              behavior of these composites. 
Model-based simulations using newly developed
              meshfree numerical procedures are performed on an automobile engine mount
              example to demonstrate structural responses and provide reliable information
              for the engineering design.

The modeling and simulation of magnetostrictive
              elastomer composite structures is intended to decrease design process time and
              cost, by reducing component testing, and to increase the simulation accuracy of
              the structures. The proposed three-dimensional material constitutive model is
              able to illustrate the overall magneto-hyperelastic behavior of Fe
              particle-reinforced elastomer composites.
