Abstract    :
              This proposal concerns the study of flexible structures, such as disk breaks,
              magnetic tape drives and computer hard disks, whose mechanical behavior is
              significantly affected by frictional contact conditions.  Of specific interest
              in the proposed research is the analytical modeling and computational
              implementation of novel friction laws (including wear) for the study of
              vibratory phenoomena such as squealing and chattering, which depend crucially
              on the modeling on the material interfaces.
