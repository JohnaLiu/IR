Abstract    :
              This research proposes novel techniques for power analysis and optimization at
              software level.  Specifically, the problem is addressed in the context of both
              general purpose or application specific processors.  In addition, the case of
              processors with multiple instruction issues or out-of-order execution, or
              architectures based on the Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) paradigm are also
              considered.  The main feature of the proposed models is their dependency on
              input data, allowing profile-driven optimizations.  Based on the proposed
              models, appropriate optimization techniques at compile-and run-time are
              proposed for reducing the energy of the instruction sequence.  This research
              will enable the assessment of any energy/performance trade-offs present in
              today's processors.  Also, based on a power estimate of the embedded software
              running on application specific processors, the co-design of mixed
              hardware/software systems can be extended to incorporate as a further design
              constraint power consumption, in addition to performance.
