The objective of
              the proposed research is to demonstrate the possibility of continuous
              fabrication of nanostructures of chosen size and shape.  The demonstration will
              be carried on self-replicating reversed micelles.  It will be attempted to
              manufacture size-controlled monodisperse sulfide semiconductor nanoparticles
              and their capped counterparts in reverse micelles.

The PI has acquired an
              extensive experience in studying the creation of nanoparticle films and
              multiparticulate layers on surfaces, with the help of surfactant coatings.  It
              was observed that in such processes, man-made templates replace nature's
              biological membranes.  Such apparent "mimicking" of biological processes has
              been generalized to a systematic biomimetic membrane chemistry for advanced
              materials preparation (e.g. colloids).  The PI has explored in detail the
              self-replication of membrane mimetic components.  The need is now to identify
              and control three essential biological function: compartmentalization,
              self-replication and self-assembly.  Templates and compartments, supplemented
              by surfactant coating, provide the same control on the extent of a chemical
              transformation as a membrane would.

The PI wants to generalize his research
              on the replication and assembly of semiconductor materials to more materials
              and nanogeometries.  The proposed research plan is exploratory and high-risk.
