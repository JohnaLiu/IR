Abstract    :
              Funds provided through this award will permit the purchase of analytical
              instrumentation to be placed in a new, state-of-the art analytical laboratory
              at the Marine Biological Laboratory.  The laboratory will support expanding
              research and education programs in land use change and its consequences for
              aquatic ecosystems.  The new laboratory will be located in climate-controlled
              space in a new building currently under construction.  The new laboratory will
              contain instruments for analysis of nutrients in soil and surface waters,
              measurement of carbon and nitrogen in soils, sediments and biological samples,
              and analysis of nitrogen fixation and denitrification in soils and sediments. 
              The new instruments will significantly expand the MBL's analytical capabilities
              in areas of recent technological advances, including dissolved nitrogen and
              phosphorus, and by greatly expanding capacity for analysis of large numbers of
              samples.  They will improve the MBL's rapidly-growing undergraduate education
              in land-water research by allowing instruments to be dedicated to undergraduate
              and graduate education during critical periods of demand.
