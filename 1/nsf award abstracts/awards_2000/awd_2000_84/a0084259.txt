Abstract    :
              This project is part of an integrated set of proposals for the Surface Heat
              Budget of the Arctic (SHEBA) Ocean project.  The goal of the current phase of
              the SHEBA project is to use data collected during a one year experiment during
              which an icebreaker frozen into the ice pack of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas
              was used as a platform for data collection.  A full annual cycle of data
              relating to feedbacks of the ocean-ice-atmosphere system was collected and will
              be used to improve model parameterizations of sea ice response to global
              warming. This project will utilize aircraft data to examine the role of ice
              crystal size/shape on the heat radiation properties in the cloud-radiation
              feedback component of the heat balance.  New parameritizations of
              cloud-radiation feedbacks will be very important in determining overall heat
              balance. The activities of this project are an essential effort to enhance the
              outcome of the SHEBA research projects designed to improve column, mesoscale
              and General Circulation Models (GCMs) that facilitate better simulations of the
              Arctic sea ice response to projected global warming trends.
