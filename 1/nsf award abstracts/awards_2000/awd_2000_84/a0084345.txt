Abstract    :
              This project will collect low altitude aerial photographs at sites in northern
              Alaska where photographs were previously taken in 1948 and 1949.  The new
              photographs will be examined for evidence of decadal changes in vegetation and
              landscape that may have occurred in response to a significant climatic warming
              that has taken place in the Alaskan Arctic over the past two decades.  The
              purpose of the comparison is: 1) to determine if ecological change has occurred
              and 2) if oblique aerial photography can be used to detect the changes.  The
              results of this feasibility study could be useful as demonstration of a
              technique that could be applied to a widely distributed set of aerial
              photographs taken fifty years ago over much of the Arctic Slope in Alaska.
