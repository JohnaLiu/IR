High-speed (compressible gas) jet flows are of obvious
              importance in transport and military aircraft.  They are also widely utilized
              as ejectors, blast nozzle flows, etc.  Unlike their low speed counterparts,
              these flows have not received extensive study by the research community.  One
              limiting issue is the availability of appropriate diagnostic techniques.

The
              Co-PI's bring considerable experience and insight to the planned studies of
              basic turbulence properties in such jet flows.  The one-year funding is to
              permit them to address the  concerns that have been raised regarding their
              experimental methods and the relationship of the data to the needs of their
              theoretical/numerical colleagues.
