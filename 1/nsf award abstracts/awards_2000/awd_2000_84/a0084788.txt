Special Project:
              Scholarship and Travel Grants for the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in
              Computing 2000, ACM, Denise Gurer, PI

On September 14-16, 2000, the third
              Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC) is being held at the
              Sheraton Hyannis Hotel in Hyannis, Massachusetts.  The meeting is a technical
              conference presenting talks by successful women in the computing field, short
              technical presentations by a range of conference participants, as well as
              panels, workshops, and birds-of-a-feather sessions.  This grant provides travel
              costs and registration expenses for approximately eighty people in computing
              and related fields who otherwise would be unlikely to attend.  The awards are
              made to selected advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and people early
              in their professional careers.  Cost sharing by the institutions represented
              covers part of the costs for many of the participants.
