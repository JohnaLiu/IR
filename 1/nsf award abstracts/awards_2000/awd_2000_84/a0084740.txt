Abstract    :
              The main objective of this research is to develop basic knowledge and to design
              the high capacity equipment for the new ultrasonic technology of recycling
              ground tire rubber (GRT).  It has been discovered in the earlier research that
              through the application of certain levels of ultrasonic amplitudes in special
              devices, the three-dimensional network in reinforced and non-reinforced
              vulcanized elastomers can be broken down leading to devulcanization within a
              short period of time of the order of a few seconds.  As the most desirable
              consequence, ultrasonically treated GRT becomes soft thereby enabling the
              rubber to be reprocessed, shaped, and revulcanized alone or in blends with
              virgin rubbers and plastics.

The study outlines a series of tasks enabling: 
              (1) the design of new equipment for continuous ultrasonic devulcanization of
              GRT; (2) the identification of the effect of powerful ultrasound on structure
              and properties of model unfilled and carbon black filled styrene-butadiene,
              natural, butadiene, and EPDM rubber vulcanizates and their mixtures which are
              the constituents of GRT; (3) to reveal the effect of carbon black on the
              ultrasonically induced mechanochemical reactions in each model rubber and their
              mixtures; (4) to investigate the effect of ultrasonic treatment of each model
              rubber vulcanizates on the mechanical properties of their blends with virgin
              rubber upon revulcanizations;  (5) to establish the optimal processing
              conditions enabling one to obtain the devulcanized GRT-based materials with
              high mechanical properties; (6) to develop the theory of rubber network
              degradation and to develop computer simulations of the reactors as an aid to
              scaling the process.
