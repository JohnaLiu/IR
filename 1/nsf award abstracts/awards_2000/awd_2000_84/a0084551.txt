Abstract    :
              At all stages in the structural life-cycle, engineers are faced with the
              formidable challenges of complex decision-making, including open-ended and
              ill-structured problems, uncertain and perhaps incomplete data, and models with
              varying scales and levels of refinement that may be incompatible. Overall, goal
              of this research is to develop formal computational approaches that support
              comprehensive decision making in structural engineering. Specifically, these
              approaches will be realized in a prototype decision support system that draws
              on the complementary strengths of the engineer and the computer in a
              joint-cognitive system. Its design will be based on three major concepts- (1)
              optimization for evaluating alternatives and supporting what-if analyses; (2)
              sub-component approach to address structural model synthesis, scalability,
              model updating and uncertainty propagation; and (3) implementation in an
              object-oriented framework of high performance distributed computing. A series
              of simple and real-life test cases will be used to evaluate the proposed
              prototype.
