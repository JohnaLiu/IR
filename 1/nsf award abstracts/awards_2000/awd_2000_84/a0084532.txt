Funds are provided to support the travel and conference
              registration fees of young investigators as participants in the conference
              Computers in Cardiology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA,
              September 24-27, 2000. 
  
A series of conferences on computers in cardiology
              was established 27 years ago in recognition of the import role that computer
              technology would play in cardiovascular research and in clinical patient care.
              The conferences also facilitate important productive communication between
              engineers and clinicians that stimulates relevant research and development.
              Participants have found the meetings to be particularly helpful because of the
              manageable size, and the commonality of interests of attendees which fosters
              interpersonal interaction outside the formal sessions. For these reasons,
              Computers in Cardiology has proven to be a major world forum for presentation
              of new research over a wide spectrum of computer applications in cardiology.
              The conference has been the prime site for gestation and early nourishment of a
              number of fundamental technologies that have led to major improvements in the
              practice of cardiology. 

The Proceedings of the conference is to be
              published by the IEEE press and copies distributed to the attendees and a
              number of libraries.
