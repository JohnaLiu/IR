Abstract    :
              In this research, a plan is outlined to continue the efforts of the Student
              Meeting Activities Subcommittee of the Power Engineering Education Committee of
              the IEEE Power Engineering Society (PES) to promote student interest in the
              power engineering field by sponsoring electrical engineering students from US
              universities to attend the 2000 North American Power Symposium to be held in
              Waterloo, Ontario.  The goal of this project is to provide an opportunity for
              students to be exposed to the most recent developments in operation,
              construction, and research in the power engineering field.  This is a
              particularly critical time for power engineering as the industry undergoes
              significant change due to the restructuring of the traditional utility
              structure.  The career opportunities for students interested in power
              engineering are many and varied; the program offers student several
              opportunities to interact with faculty and students from other universities in
              the power area.
