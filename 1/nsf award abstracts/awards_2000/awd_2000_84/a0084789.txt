Abstract    :
              In this United Engineering Foundation conference in Singapore (Sept. 24-28,
              2000) the recent progress in both fundamental aspects and applications of bulk
              metallic glasses will be discussed.  Topics include the atomic structure,
              materials synthesis, glass-forming ability, and physical, chemical, thermal,
              and mechanical properties of metallic glasses.  Metallic glasses with amorphous
              structures were first synthesized by Paul Duwez in the early 1960s using rapid
              solidification techniques.  A breakthrough in the design of metallic glasses
              was first made in 1989 in Japan when bulk quantities of material were
              successfully synthesized with multi-element systems. The critical cooling rates
              of these bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) containing multiple alloying elements
              approach those of oxide glasses. At present, BMGs based on Zr, Ti, Ni, Fe, Co,
              Al, Mg, and rare-earth elements have all been successfully synthesized.

BMGs constitute a new and exciting class of metallic materials with
              interesting properties for structural and functional use. For the past decade,
              substantial advances have been achieved in understanding the glass forming
              ability and synthesizing new bulk amorphous alloys containing multi-components.
               BMGs with cross-sectional thickness greater than 3 cm can now be produced by
              conventional melting and casting techniques. Despite this technological
              success, fundamental understanding of phase stability, impurity effects,
              localized shear band formation, and non-Newtonian flow behavior is still
              lacking.
