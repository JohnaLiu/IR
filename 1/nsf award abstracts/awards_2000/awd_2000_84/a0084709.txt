This award will support the participation of junior
              scientists and invited speakers at the conference on Virtual Observatories of
              the Future.  The conference will be held in Pasadena, California on June 13 -
              16, 2000.  The goal of the conference is to serve as a roadmap building venue
              for a National Virtual Observatory.  The meeting should provide a forum for
              starting the process of transition of a National Virtual Observatory from a
              vision into a well-designed, effective program, driven by the scientific needs
              of the community.
