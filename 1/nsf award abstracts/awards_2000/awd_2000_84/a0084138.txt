Abstract    :
              This award provides partial support for the construction of a central research
              facility at the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve of Stanford. The Preserve
              currently has a patchwork of dispersed, antiquated structures that were never
              intended to be permanent or to serve their current functions. The new
              centralized buildings will provide space for research,  and for a variety of
              educational activities. The Preserve offers significant research opportunities
              in a number of fields because of the geologic history of its site, the
              resulting ecological diversity in the area, and the proximity of the site to
              research and educational institutions in the San Francisco Bay Area. Research
              activities at the site include a number of long-term and short-term projects,
              both representing a broad range of disciplines and a diverse community of
              researchers. Areas of research strength include: multi-disciplinary studies of
              global change; biological invasions; global biogeochemistry; conservation
              biology; and landscape and community ecology.  The new construction has been
              planned with three major considerations: needs demonstrated by research
              programs at the site over the past 10 years; current and anticipated research
              programs, including pending proposals; and feedback from visiting scientists
              and students. The new centralized facility is expected to accommodate current
              activities plus 20% growth over a 20-year period.
