Abstract    :
              In assessing the risk to US society of nonindigenous species (NIS)-species
              introduced into an ecosystem in which they did not previously exist-this
              interdisciplinary team will use a model derived from economic theory to
              integrate ecological, economic, and social benefits and costs of NIS. In the
              freshwater ecosystems of the world, NIS are the leading cause of biodiversity
              loss; in most other ecosystems, NIS are one of the top three causes. Not only
              do NIS cause enormous ecological changes, but they also directly cause large
              economic losses and social change (e.g., as native harvestable resources are
              replaced by NIS). Although policies and regulations are being implementing to
              reduce the occurrence and impact of NIS (e.g., ballast regulations in the Great
              Lakes and coastal waters), these steps are being taken in the absence of a
              basic scientific understanding of the biological, economic, and social
              dimensions of the process of biological invasions. This team of aquatic
              ecologists, ecological modelers, and social scientists will develop an
              integrative approach to risk assessment of NIS, using the North American Great
              Lakes as a case study.
