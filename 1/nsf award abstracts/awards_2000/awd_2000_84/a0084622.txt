It was found recently that a small DC bias applied across an
              ice/metal interface can significantly modify the work of ice adhesion and
              interfacial shear strength. Depending on particular experimental conditions ice
              adhesion can be either significantly enhanced  or almost eliminated  by the DC
              bias. It is proposed to study the physical mechanisms that are responsible for
              these effects. The following three physical processes, which are capable of
              modifying ice adhesion and are the most probable mechanisms of the phenomenon
              will be studied in detail: 
1. The electrochemical decomposition
              (electrolysis) of ice adjacent to electrodes. 
2. Depression of the freezing
              point of water caused by intensive injection of ions from electrodes in the
              water. 
3. Electrostatic energy stored in electric double layers on the ice/
              metal interface. 
The inverse process of healing the interfacial damage caused
              by ice electrolysis will also be studied. The healing occurs due to mass
              transport in the ice quasi-liquid layer. Finally, Joule's heat generation and
              heat transfer will be measured. Experiments will be performed on pure and doped
              ices and on various electrode and substrate materials. 
Because of the
              project's multidisciplinary nature, a variety of experimental and theoretical
              methods will be applied. Among them are measurements of the work and strength
              of ice adhesion, several modes of scanning probe microscopy (SPM), optical
              spectroscopy of ions and atoms in water and ice, AC and DC electrical
              measurements of ice and water, and theoretical analysis. 
 When completed,
              this research will provide fundamental knowledge of how direct currents and
              electric fields affect ice adhesion to metals. That basic knowledge can then be
              used in developing new de-icing and anti-icing technologies.
