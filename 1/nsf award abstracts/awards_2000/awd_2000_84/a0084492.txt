Abstract    :
              This award provides support for improvement of the physical infrastructure of
              the La Selva station of the Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS), a
              nonprofit consortium of 56 universities and research institutions from the
              United States, Costa Rica and Australia. La Selva encompasses 1,536 hectares of
              classic lowland tropical rain forest in northeastern Costa Rica, a country
              renowned for its outstanding national system of conservation areas.  The
              station is the largest of three biological field stations operated by OTS in
              Costa Rica, the others being Las Cruces (mid-elevation cloud forest near
              Panama) and Palo Verde (lowland monsoonally-dry forest in Guanacaste Province).
               At these sites OTS works in cooperation with governmental and
              partner-organizations on scientific issues of training, conservation,
              environmental education, and natural resource management.

Over its 46-year
              history, La Selva has hosted 3,000 research projects, resulting in over 2,000
              scientific publications and 160 theses and dissertations.  Visitation has
              reached 25,000 person-days a year, with education use by 3,000 students and
              faculty in 1999. After a decade of increasing usage, La Selva's housing and
              trail system are inadequate to meet the physical demands of this level of use. 
              This award will support plans to permanently address the issue of inadequate
              housing for researchers, degraded trails in the old-growth forest and a
              deteriorating laboratory at the station.  This assistance will enable La Selva
              to continue to be a center of excellence for research and training in tropical
              ecology during the decade ahead.
