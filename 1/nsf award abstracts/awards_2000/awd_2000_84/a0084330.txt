This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research
              involves Philip J. Hatcher and Robert D. Russell of the University of New
              Hampshire and Luc Bouge's research group at the French National Institute for
              Research in Informatics and Applied Mathematics'(INRIA) Laboratoire de
              l'Informatique du Parallelisme in Lyon, France.  The proposal addresses
              implementation of the Java programming language for parallel programs on
              cluster computers using the multithreading package PM2 developed by the French
              researchers.   The work will be performed in the context of the Hyperion
              environment, developed at the University of New Hampshire and comprised of a
              Java-bytecode-to-C translator and a run-time library for the distributed
              execution of Java threads.  The proposal will advance understanding of Java
              language as a tool for programming distributed memory parallel computers.
              

This award represents the US side of a joint proposal to NSF and the French
              National Institute for Research in Informatics and Applied Mathematics (INRIA).
               NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for US Investigator.  INRIA
              will support visits of French researchers to the US.
