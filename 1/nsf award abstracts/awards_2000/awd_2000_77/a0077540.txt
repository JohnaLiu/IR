Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Carleton College will acquire an
              Electrospray/Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization Ion Trap Mass
              Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas
              including a) the analysis of peptides synthesized as enzyme inhibitors; b)
              glutathione-nitric oxide chemistry; c) electrochemically-initiated
              metalloporphyrin polymer formation; d) analysis of synthetic products such as
              vanadium (IV) ion sequestering agents; and e) analysis of organic components in
              atmospheric aerosols.  The ion trap mass spectrometer will also be used in
              formal course work at Carleton.  

Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used
              to probe intimate structural details and to obtain the molecular compositions
              of a vast array of organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The
              results from these studies will have an impact in a number of areas including
              biochemistry and atmospheric chemistry.
