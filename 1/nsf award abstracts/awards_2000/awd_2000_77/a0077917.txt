Abstract    :
              With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities
              (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University will
              acquire a 500 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to
              carry out studies on a) enzymatic and bioorganic reaction mechanisms; b)
              synthesis of complex, bioactive, marine natural products; c) development of new
              synthetic methods centered on asymmetric synthesis; and d) syntheses and
              applications of libraries of catalysts for discovery and optimization of new
              asymmetric transformations.   

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
              is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the
              structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to
              characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the
              dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to
              state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out
              frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a
              number of areas including biological chemistry and catalysis.
