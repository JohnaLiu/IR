Abstract    :
              The objective of this project is to focus on using enzyme-mediated reactions to
              effect changes in the chemical structures of triacylglycerols by substituting
              long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid residues with beneficial attributes for
              residues that have been implicated in health problems.  Studies of the kinetics
              of the interesterification reactions involved in these transformations will
              lead to mathematical models that can be used for purposes of process simulation
              and optimization.  These modified fats and oils could be used in formulating an
              array of nutraceutical products.  Nutraceuticals provide either therapeutic or
              preventative medicinal values.
